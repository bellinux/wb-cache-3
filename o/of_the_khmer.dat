5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire. The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> of Vietnam while the Khmer living in the remote Cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the Middle Khmer language.|$|E
5|$|On 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh {{bringing}} the Cambodian Civil War to an end. Long Boret, Lon Non {{and other top}} officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic Government were executed at the Cercle Sportif, while FANK troops in the city were disarmed, taken to the Olympic Stadium and executed.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 through 1974, {{the war was}} {{conducted}} along FANK's lines of communications {{north and south of}} the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.|$|E

50|$|During this time, America {{continued}} its bombing campaign against Cambodia, leading to huge amounts <b>of</b> civilian deaths. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge used <b>the</b> campaign as recruiting {{material for the}} largely ignored and angry peasantry <b>of</b> Cambodia. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge also started to centralise around Pol Pot, who took power in 1962. Pot {{took the opportunity to}} purge the party, and the party became increasingly focused around <b>the</b> worship <b>of</b> Pol Pot. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic fell in April 1975, when <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge entered Phnom Penh, and ousted the Republican government, officially declaring alliance to Pol Pot.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the stone}} inscriptions, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest <b>Khmer</b> {{documents}} are translations and commentaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pali Buddhist texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tripitaka written in <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> script.|$|R
5|$|Linguistic study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> {{language}} divides {{its history}} into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from {{words and phrases}} in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, {{is referred to as}} Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1970, taking {{advantage}} of a visit by Sihanouk to Moscow and Beijing, the prince was deposed by the National Assembly, who promptly announced the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic. The real power, however, fell into the hands of Lon Nol. The general promptly issued an ultimatum to the North Vietnamese, ordering them out of the country, but the only real result was that the Cambodian Army led a bloody pogrom against ethnic Vietnamese in the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|The power vacuum the Vietnamese {{communist}}s left in {{its wake}} in Cambodia was soon filled by the return of a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries, many of whom received their communist education in France. In 1960, the KPRP {{changed its name to}} the Kampuchean Communist Party (KCP), and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan as the ‘true’ political institution memorialising the KCP. This clique became the genesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, and its doctrine was heavily influenced by the Maoist ideology.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is a classification scheme showing <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>Khmer</b> dialects.|$|R
25|$|Much of what {{is known}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient <b>Khmer</b> society comes from the many bas-reliefs and also the {{first-hand}} Chinese accounts of Zhou Daguan, which provide information on 13th-century Cambodia and earlier. <b>The</b> bas-reliefs <b>of</b> Angkor temples, such as those in Bayon, describe everyday life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient <b>Khmer</b> kingdom, including scenes of palace life, naval battles on the river or lakes, and common scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marketplace.|$|R
50|$|Despite the Cambodian Army's heavy resistance, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge {{eventually}} captured <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Kampot on April 2. Both sides suffered heavy casualties {{during the}} fighting but many more civilians were rendered homeless. After <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Kampot, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge launched another offensive to capture Oudong.|$|R
5|$|Various {{authors have}} {{proposed}} slightly different analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> vowel system. This {{may be in}} part because of the wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region. The description below follows Huffman (1970). The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos {{attacked}} Pochentong airfield, the main base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This {{may have been a}} blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.|$|E
5|$|FUNCINPEC {{had its own}} {{military}} forces, which was first known as the Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS) when it was formed on 4 September 1982. The ANS was an amalgation of several armed resistance movements that have pledged alliances with Sihanouk. They consisted of MOULINAKA, Kleang Moeung, Oddar Tus and Khmer Angkor, giving the ANS a combined strength of 7,000 troops. In Tam, a former Prime Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic, was appointed as the Commander-in-chief of the ANS in its founding year. In the initial years of after its formation, the ANS received weapons and equipment from China, as well as medical supplies and combat training for its troops from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. At the same time, the ANS regularly faced attacks from the Khmer Rouge forces until 1987, suffering heavy casualties as a result.|$|E
50|$|Emigrants from Kalinga came to Cambodia in the 3rd century BC, {{fleeing from}} the emperor Ashoka.However, after Ashoka had {{converted}} to Buddhism and sent missionaries to Cambodia, they accepted the teachings and helped establish the {{religion in the}} region.The early monuments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmers</b> (<b>of</b> modern Cambodia) appear to be of Andhra origin rather than from Kalinga.However, although some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inscriptions at Angkor Wat in Cambodia are in Sanskrit, others are in the Kalinga script.The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angkor Wat temple shows influences from Orissa and <b>the</b> Chola <b>of</b> Tamil Nadu.|$|R
25|$|A 16th century Portuguese friar, António da Madalena, was {{the first}} European visitor to visit Angkor Wat in 1586. By the 17th century, Angkor Wat was not {{completely}} abandoned. Fourteen inscriptions from the 17th century testify to Japanese settlements alongside those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>Khmer.</b> <b>The</b> best-known inscription tells of Ukondafu Kazufusa, who celebrated <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> New Year there in 1632.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, {{the novel}} [...] by Patricia McCormick was {{published}} with HarperCollins. It retells Arn Chorn-Pond's childhood story <b>of</b> surviving during <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge regime.|$|R
5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E
5|$|Operation Eagle Pull was the United States {{military}} evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, Phnom Penh, {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{supported}} the Vietnamese in their 1978 invasion of Cambodia, an invasion {{considered by the}} First World, most notably the United States, and the People's Republic of China {{to be under the}} direct command of the Soviet Union. The USSR also became the largest backer of the new puppet state in Cambodia, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). In a 1979 summit Jimmy Carter complained to Brezhnev about the presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, to which Brezhnev replied that the citizens of the PRK were delighted about the overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge-led government; in this, as historian Archie Brown notes, he was right.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> Communist Party <b>of</b> Cambodia, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge (1951–81), {{established}} their regime as Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979) in Cambodia, their anti-intellectualism which idealised {{the country and}} demonised the cities was immediately imposed on the country {{in order to establish}} agrarian socialism, thus, they emptied cities in order to purge <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> nation <b>of</b> every traitor, enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, and intellectual, often symbolised by eyeglasses (see the Killing Fields).|$|R
2500|$|From Kambuja itself— and so {{also from}} the Angkor region— no written records have survived other than stone inscriptions. Therefore, <b>the</b> current {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical <b>Khmer</b> civilisation is derived primarily from: ...|$|R
2500|$|Crossbows {{were given}} to the Chams by China with {{instruction}} in crossbows and mounted archery being given by a Chinese official in 1171. In 1177 <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> crossbow technology by the Chinese was used by the Champa in their invasion and sacking <b>of</b> Angkor, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire's capital.|$|R
5|$|Angkor, {{the seat}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire was {{subjected}} to Vietnamese influence {{as early as the}} 13th century. Vietnamese influence spread gradually and indirectly, and {{it was not until the}} early 19th century that Vietnam exercised direct control. In 1813, Nak Ong Chan gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a protectorate. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese ‘province’. Throughout the 1830s, Vietnam attempted to erase Khmer culture, which had derived the basis of Cambodian society, dress and religion from India rather than China. The trend of Vietnamese dominance continued during French colonization, under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its southern cone (which would later be Saigon, the Mekong Delta and Tây Ninh) to the Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia had lost during the previous centuries.|$|E
5|$|Northern Khmer (called Khmer Surin in Khmer) {{refers to}} the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present-day {{northeast}} Thailand. After the fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire in the early 15th century, the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Lan Xang. The conquests of Cambodia by Naresuan the Great for Ayutthaya furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from {{the midpoint of the}} Middle Khmer period. This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages Lao and Thai, lexical differences, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants. Syllable-final , which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer, is still pronounced in Northern Khmer. Some linguists classify Northern Khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an {{emergency}} meeting of the United Nations Security Council, so Prince Norodom Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance. Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea’s sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime. Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by the People's Republic of China, France, Norway, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy analyst from the Cato Institute argues that Vietnam did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina.|$|E
50|$|According to Samuel Totten, 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban <b>Khmer</b> {{population}} (500,000 people killed) perished under <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, while rural Khmers lost 16% (825,000 people killed) {{of their}} population, putting the killing at a scale comparable to genocide of Roma (25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roma population <b>of</b> Europe, 130,000-500,000 people) and <b>the</b> genocide <b>of</b> Serbians (300-000-500,000 Serbs) during the Holocaust drawing the comparison to genocide aforementioned.|$|R
2500|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement's {{history has}} been {{shrouded}} in mystery, largely because successive purges, especially during the Democratic Kampuchea period, have left so few survivors to recount their experiences. One thing is evident, however, <b>the</b> tension between <b>Khmer</b> and Vietnamese was a major theme in the movement's development. In the three decades between <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> World War II and <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge victory, <b>the</b> appeal <b>of</b> communism to Western educated intellectuals (and {{to a lesser extent}} its more inchoate attraction for poor peasants) was tempered by the apprehension that the much stronger Vietnamese movement was using communism as an ideological rationale for dominating <b>the</b> <b>Khmer.</b> <b>The</b> analogy between the Vietnamese communists and the Nguyễn Dynasty, which had legitimized its encroachments in the 19th century in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "civilizing mission" [...] of Confucianism, was persuasive. Thus, <b>the</b> new brand <b>of</b> indigenous communism that emerged after 1960 combined nationalist and revolutionary appeals and, when it could afford to, exploited the virulent anti-Vietnamese sentiments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmers.</b> Khmer Rouge literature in the 1970s frequently referred to the Vietnamese as yuon (barbarian), a term dating from the Angkorian period.|$|R
50|$|As {{everyone}} in Cambodia knew Khmer Rouge killed lots of knowledgeable persons almost of whole country <b>of</b> Cambodia, after <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge Cambodia are less original authors. Santel Phin {{is one of}} few authors who wrote the original story in Cambodia, after <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge. He was recognize as writer after the slaughter.|$|R
5|$|The other non-communist {{organisation}} was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, {{formed by}} Sihanouk and {{known by its}} French acronym FUNCINPEC. The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the Khmer Rouge following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer Rouge representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea’s seat at the UN vacant {{on the basis that}} neither the Khmer Rouge nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people. He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge, and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{settlers}} {{began to}} settle in modern-day Cochinchina and Ho Chi Minh City from the 1620s onwards. To the Cambodians, these lands were known as Kampuchea Krom and traditionally under the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Empire. From the era of Chey Chettha II onwards, they came {{under the control of}} the Nguyễn lords. In 1813, Emperor Gia Long sent 10,000 Vietnamese troops into Phnom Penh and some members of the Cambodian royal family came {{under the control of the}} Vietnamese court. The Nguyen court imposed Vietnamese customs upon the Cambodian populace, and names of towns and provinces were changed to Vietnamese ones. Vietnamese settlers were encouraged {{to settle in}} Cambodia and official documents from the Vietnamese court recorded an average of 5,000 Vietnamese settlers coming into Cambodia in the 1830s. The policies imposed by the Nguyen court stirred resentment among the Cambodian populace and provoked occasional rebellions.|$|E

50|$|After {{four years}} <b>of</b> rule, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge regime {{was removed from}} power in 1979 {{as a result of}} an {{invasion}} by <b>the</b> Socialist Republic <b>of</b> Vietnam and was replaced by moderate, pro-Vietnamese Communists. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> Rouge survived into the 1990s as a resistance movement operating in western Cambodia from bases in Thailand. In 1996, following a peace agreement, their leader Pol Pot formally dissolved the organization. Pol Pot died on 15 April 1998, having never been put on trial.|$|R
25|$|Ung's {{first book}} has been criticized by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cambodian {{community}} in the United States, a number of whom {{believe that it is}} more a work of fiction than an actual autobiography. She has also been accused <b>of</b> misrepresenting <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> race and playing on ethnic stereotypes for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> self-aggrandizement and over-dramatization to increase sales and publicity.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> coup <b>of</b> 1970 overthrew <b>the</b> {{government}} <b>of</b> Sihanouk, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> Communists, including Khieu Samphan, {{joined forces}} with <b>the</b> now-deposed Head <b>of</b> State in establishing an anti-government coalition known as the Gouvernement royal d'union nationale du Kampuchéa (GRUNK). In this alliance with his former enemies, Samphan served as deputy prime minister, minister of defence, and commander-in-chief of GRUNK military forces.|$|R
