25|$|A {{waveplate}} or retarder is an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> that {{alters the}} polarization state {{of a light}} wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate {{can be used to}} produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) is an {{electronically}} modulated <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> shaped into a thin, flat panel made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed {{in front of a}} light source or reflector. In 1964, George H.

25|$|After {{moving back}} to Paris in 1923, at André Breton's urging and through the {{financing}} of Jacques Doucet, Duchamp built another <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> based on the first one, Rotative Demisphère, optique de précision (Rotary Demisphere, Precision Optics). This time the optical element was a globe cut in half, with black concentric circles painted on it. When it spins, the circles appear to move backwards and forwards in space.

25|$|In optics, {{a virtual}} image {{is an image}} formed when the {{outgoing}} rays from a point on an object always diverge. The image appears to be located {{at the point of}} apparent divergence. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by dotted lines. Virtual images are located by tracing the real rays that emerge from an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to a perceived point of origin.|$|E
25|$|A lens is a {{transmissive}} <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> {{that focuses}} or disperses a light beam {{by means of}} refraction. A simple lens consists of {{a single piece of}} transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E

25|$|A {{liquid-crystal display}} (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other {{electronically}} modulated <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> {{that uses the}} light-modulating properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome. LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden, such as preset words, digits, and 7-segment displays, as in a digital clock. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images {{are made up of}} a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.|$|E
25|$|A stadimeter, a type {{of optical}} rangefinder, is an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> for {{estimating}} the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between {{the top and bottom}} of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object. The stadimeter was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske, a Rear-Admiral in the United States Navy. The first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. Likewise, the stadimeter proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. U.S. patent #523,721 was issued to Fiske on July 31, 1894.|$|E
25|$|Though image {{intensification}} technology {{employed by}} different manufacturers varies, from the tactical {{point of view}} a night vision system is an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> that enables vision at low light. The US government itself has recognized the fact that technology itself makes little difference as long as an operator can see clearly at night. Consequently, the United States bases export regulations not on the generations, but on a calculated factor called figure of merit (FOM). The method of FOM calculation {{and its implications for}} export are briefly described in a National Defense University document called “The NATO Response Force” authored by Jeffrey P. Bialos, the Executive Director of the Transatlantic Security and Industry Program at the Johns Hopkins University and Stuart L. Koehl, a Fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the same university.|$|E

25|$|Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 {{million in}} 1991 and lost. Geller's {{suit against the}} CSICOP was thrown out in 1995, and {{he was ordered to}} pay $120,000 for filing a {{frivolous}} lawsuit. The legal costs Randi incurred ate through almost all of a $272,000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to Randi in 1986 for his work. Randi also dismissed Uri Geller's claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography made famous by the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argues, of trick photography using a simple hand-held <b>optical</b> <b>device.</b> During the period of Geller's legal dispute, CSICOP's leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller's litigation, demanded that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. Randi refused and resigned, though he has maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} color {{photography}} used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not {{possible with the}} photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it {{in the form of}} three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could either be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; viewed as an additive color image by {{one person at a time}} through an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.|$|E

500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is {{sitting in front of the}} viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E

2500|$|One may imagine {{two such}} cavities, each {{in its own}} {{isolated}} radiative and thermodynamic equilibrium. One may imagine an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> that allows radiative heat transfer between the two cavities, filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies. If {{the values of the}} spectral radiances of the radiations in the cavities differ in that frequency band, heat may be expected to pass from the hotter to the colder. One might propose to use such a filtered transfer of heat in such a band to drive a heat engine. If the two bodies are at the same temperature, the second law of thermodynamics does not allow the heat engine to work. It may be inferred that for a temperature common to the two bodies, the values of the spectral radiances in the pass-band must also be common. This must hold for every frequency band. [...] This became clear to Balfour Stewart and later to Kirchhoff. Balfour Stewart found experimentally that of all surfaces, one of lamp-black emitted the greatest amount of thermal radiation for every quality of radiation, judged by various filters.|$|E
2500|$|Binocular rivalry was {{discovered}} by Porta (1593, as cited in Wade, 1996). Porta put one book {{in front of one}} eye, and another in front of the other. He reported that he could read from one book at a time and that changing {{from one to the other}} required withdrawing the [...] "visual virtue" [...] from one eye and moving it to the other. According to Wade (1998), binocular colour rivalry was first reported by Le Clerk (1712). Desaguiliers (1716) also recorded it when looking at different colours from spectra in the bevel of a mirror. The clearest early description of both colour and contour rivalry was made by Dutour (1760, 1763; see translations by O'Shea, 1999a, b). To experience colour rivalry Dutour either crossed his eyes or overdiverged his eyes (a form of free fusion commonly used also at the end of the 20th century to view Magic Eye stereograms) to look at differently coloured pieces of cloth (Dutour, 1760) or differently coloured pieces of glass (Dutour, 1763). To experience contour rivalry Dutour again used free fusion of different objects or used a prism or a mirror in front of one eye to project different images into it. The first clear description of rivalry in English was by Charles Wheatstone (e.g., 1838). Wheatstone invented the stereoscope, an <b>optical</b> <b>device</b> (in Wheatstone's case using mirrors) to present different images to the two eyes.|$|E
