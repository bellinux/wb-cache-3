40|$|Poly {{aromatic}} amides, aramids, {{have attracted}} {{a lot of}} attention because of their excellent physical properties like high strength, flame resistance, durability. Polymer backbone contains rigid aromatic rings linked by amide bridges which experience additional attractive forces of Hydrogen bonding. The microstructure may be crystalline in nature if rings have p- linkages or amorphous if connectivity is at O-or m- positions. The properties have been modified in several ways to suit the specific applications. Poly dimethyl siloxanes, PDMS are known as specialty polymers for their unique properties. The backbone is very soft but thermally stable. The block copolymers <b>of</b> <b>aramids</b> and PDMS are one of the new active research fields. The hard and soft blocks are connected together to achieve the desirable properties like thermal stability, physical strength and controllable processibility. In the present work, various combinations of the aramid and PDMS blocks have been studied. The aramid blocks in the form of oligomers were prepared under inert and moisture tree environment set at low temperature around zero degree Celsius. The diamines were dissolved in DMAc and chilled. The diacids were also dissolved in DMAc and added drop-wise to the chilled solution. Triethylamine was later used to remove the HC 1 and the mixtures were stirred for overnight. To prepare the block copolymers, PDMS oligomers were dissolve in THF and added drop-wise to the aramid oligomers solutions, both in equimolar quantities. The copolymers were precipitated out with methanol, washed and dried. A total of 37 block copolymers have been synthesized. For reference purposes, 5 pure aramid polymers were also prepared. All the samples have been characterized for their chemical structure by FTIR. proton NMR, DV-Visible, TGA and Elemental analysis techniques. The FTIR spectra of the block copolymers show the presence of all the active functional groups present in the aramid and PDMS parts. The assigned peaks can also be located on the individual relevant spectra of pure aramid polymer and PDMS oligomer. Similarly the NMR results have also proved the presence of all the respective types of protons in the block copolymer. The results of UV-Visible scans have shown clearly the presence and effect of hydrogen bonding in the aramid blocks. The shift in peak position is indicative of the increase in magnitude of such interaction in the samples resulting from the increase in aramid block length. The thermal stability concluded from the TGA curves have been found in accordance with the nature of the backbone. The block copolymers with longer aramid blocks need higher temperature to reach the ten percent degradation mark. The elemental analyses have provided almost the same contents of carbons, hydrogen and nitrogen as expected in the chemical formulae of one pair of an aramid and a PDMS blocks. Summarizing the results, it can be concluded that the aramid-PDMS block copolymers have been synthesized successfully according to the plan...|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the bonding {{properties}} between poly (m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) fibers and PMIA-pulp and to improve the mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> sheets, PMIA fibers have been treated with various chemical modifying agents. The surface morphology of the treated fibers has been analyzed and the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> sheets made from the treated PMIA fibers and PMIA-pulp have been investigated.

Aramid and nylon filaments were used to make two kinds of para-aramid ATY and four kinds of aramid/nylon hybrid ATY with dry and wet treatments. The analyzed physical properties of six specimens (made on the ATY machine) are as follows. The tenacity and initial modulus <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> and aramid/nylon hybrid ATY decreased with the wetting and breaking strain; however, the yarn linear density <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> and hybrid ATY increased with wetting treatment. The dry and wet thermal shrinkage of the hybrid ATY increased with wet-ting. The stability <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> and hybrid ATY also increased with wetting. The physical properties of core/effect type hybrid ATY showed significantly more change than the core type hybrid ATY and the physical properties of nylon/aramid core/ effect hybrid ATY showedsignificantly more change than the of aramid/nylon core/effect hybrid ATY. A higher bulky and breaking strain of hybrid ATY require ATY processing conditions of nylon on the core part with wetting and aramid on the effect part. ATY processing conditions for nylon and aramid on the core part with wetting are required for a higher tenacity and modulus. ATY processing conditions <b>of</b> nylon and <b>aramid</b> on the core with no wetting are required for a low thermal shrinkage.

40|$|Automotive {{friction}} {{materials are}} multi component composites in which fibrous materials play a fundamental role. Modern friction formulations {{have been developed}} around asbestos fibres, a heavily used material before legislation outlawed its use in the 1980 ’s. The replacement adopted by the friction industry was aramid, a high performance, high cost synthetic fibre. The work in this thesis investigates the role <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> fibres in an economy friction material from the early mixing stages in manufacture using mechanical and optical analysis techniques through to the friction and wear performance of brake pads by employing instrumented friction and wear machines. Experimental procedures were designed and employed to quantify the performance <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> pulp within the friction formulation {{as a function of}} volume fraction. Investigation showed a hierarchal fibre structure produced by an inherent molecular structure that encourages fibrillation producing complex fibre morphologies. This physical structure has been identified as fundamental to the success <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> pulp in friction materials as the fibre network readily entraps small particles aiding the manufacturing process of friction materials. A structural model has been developed to describe both the particle retention performance <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> fibres and the bulk structure of the pulp as a function of fibre geometry. A dynamic mechanical test was used to measure the bulk elastic properties of fibre networks to assess their suitability as processing fibres in friction materials and providing a novel analytical technique for the friction industry. Hemp, flax and jute are examples of high performance natural fibres that offer a significant cost saving over aramid, representing candidate replacements. Various natural fibres were trialled in friction formulations as direct replacements and also blended with aramid pulp. The results are compared to the baseline specification produced for aramid pulp allowing the suitability of natural fibres in friction materials to be discussed.

40|$|Aramid fibers {{owe their}} high tensile {{strength}} and stiffness to their orderly fibrillar structure. The synergistic effect of individual fibrils comprising an aramid fiber, and the interfibrillar interactions determine the strength of an individual fiber. In order to study the existence and role of statistical defects in failure initiation <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> fibers, quasi-static tensile tests were performed with individual fibers of different molecular compositions and gage lengths {{in the range of}} 100 µm– 10 mm. The experimental results pointed out to a relative insensitivity of the tensile strength to the fiber gage length, which suggested that failure initiation is governed by processes and/or flaws active at length scales well below micron scale. Therefore, differences in tensile strength between the particular types <b>of</b> <b>aramid</b> fibers discussed in this study were attributed to interfibrillar interactions. The magnitude of the latter was assessed by longitudinal crack growth experiments with individual fibers, as interfibrillar interactions are expected to be similar to the van der Waals interactions between the hydrogen bonded macromolecular sheets comprising the aramid fibers. The initial fracture experiments showed stable crack propagation under relatively constant force taking place for very large lengths of individual fibers.
