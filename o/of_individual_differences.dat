40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the belief patterns of music teachers with regard to the nature and significance <b>of</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> and in the context of secondary school classroom music teaching. Belief patterns were collected in the form of Personal Construct models, drawing on Kelly's Theory of Personal Constructs. The study explored both music teachers' Personal Construct models of pupil individuality and the reported significance of those models of pupil individuality for the participants' teaching approaches. The investigation of Personal Construct models concentrated on how each participant grouped the pupils they teach according to perceptions <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference.</b> The belief patterns of participants were also compared. The study involved eight secondary school music teachers working in the west of Scotland. Participants' construct models were elicited using Repertory Grid technique, where pupils were the grid elements, and factors <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference,</b> the constructs. The influence <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> on classroom practice was then investigated using semi-structured interviews. Three main findings from the study are discussed. First, there was considerable variation among participants in the choice <b>of</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> believed to be significant for teaching in music, and therefore in their Personal Construct models. Second, there were notable similarities in how participants appeared to group sets of pupils within those models, even though the models themselves varied widely. Finally, Personal Construct models and specific belief patterns relating to <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> appear to be important influences on the structure and nature of teaching in music...|$|R

In Study 2, 281 Austrians indicated their agreement with an entirely fictitious conspiracy theory and completed a battery <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> measures not examined in Study 1.

25|$|Using the {{viewpoints}} of {{this emerging}} science and reading {{extensively in the}} ethology literature, Bowlby developed new explanatory hypotheses for what {{is now known as}} human attachment behaviour. In particular, on the basis of ethological evidence he was able to reject the dominant Cupboard Love theory of attachment prevailing in psychoanalysis and learning theory of the 1940s and 1950s. He also introduced the concepts of environmentally stable or labile human behaviour allowing for the revolutionary combination of the idea of a species-specific genetic bias to become attached and the concept <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> in attachment security as environmentally labile strategies for adaptation to a specific childrearing niche. Alternatively, Bowlby's thinking about the nature and function of the caregiver-child relationship influenced ethological research, and inspired students of animal behaviour such as Tinbergen, Hinde, and Harry Harlow.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> cannot be ignored, scientific {{evidence suggests that}} certain working conditions are stressful to most people. Such evidence argues for {{a greater emphasis on}} working conditions as the key source of job stress, and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy. Large surveys of working conditions, including conditions recognized as risk factors for job stress, were conducted in member states of the European Union in 1990, 1995, and 2000. Results showed a time trend suggesting an increase in work intensity. In 1990, the percentage of workers reporting that they worked at high speeds at least one-quarter of their working time was 48%, increasing to 54% in 1995 and to 56% in 2000. Similarly, 50% of workers reported they work against tight deadlines at least one-fourth of their working time in 1990, increasing to 56% in 1995 and 60% in 2000. However, no change was noted in the period 1995–2000 (data not collected in 1990) in the percentage of workers reporting sufficient time to complete tasks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{education}} is not to impart knowledge but instead to facilitate a child’s thinking and problem solving skills which can be transferred {{to a range of}} situations. The major purpose of teaching is that of helping students gain knowledge, feelings and valuing skills that they need to function effectively in the society. One way of making students acquire valuing skills is through use <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> teaching strategy. In this respect, {{the purpose of the study}} was to find out the effect on the use <b>of</b> <b>Individual</b> <b>Difference</b> Strategy in the acquisition of Valuing Skills amongst youths in secondary schools in Kenya. The study was anchored on the Constructivism theory by Brunner and adopted a descriptive survey design biased to quantitative approach that utilize questionnaire to collect data from 13 teachers’ and 309 students. Stratified random sampling technique was employed to select the sample of students and purposive sampling was applied in choice of the teachers.

25|$|Terms such as 'hard-working,' 'reliable,' and 'persevering' {{describe}} desirable {{aspects of}} character. Because {{it was once}} {{believed to be a}} moral evaluation, conscientiousness was overlooked as a real psychological attribute. The reality <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> in conscientiousness has now been clearly established by studies of cross-observer agreement. Peer and expert ratings confirm the self-reports that people make about their degrees of conscientiousness. Furthermore, both self-reports and observer ratings of conscientiousness predict real-life outcomes such as academic success. During most of the 20th century, psychologists believed that personality traits could be divided into two categories: temperament and character. Temperament traits were thought to be biologically based, whereas character traits were thought to be learned either during childhood or throughout life. With the advent of the FFM (Five-Factor Model), behavior geneticists began systematic studies of the full range of personality traits, and {{it soon became clear that}} all five factors are substantially heritable. Identical twins showed very similar personality traits even when they had been separated at birth and raised apart, and this was equally true for both character traits and temperament traits. Parents and communities influence the ways in which conscientiousness is expressed, but they apparently do not influence its level.|$|E
25|$|All {{researched}} psychological {{traits are}} influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees. These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother {{in his or her}} (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> in behavior. Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic, where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. Active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.|$|E

2500|$|Cross-cultural {{studies of}} {{differences}} in narcissism are rare. Instead, {{as there is a}} positive association between narcissism and individualism and a negative one between it and collectivism, these traits have been used as proxies for narcissism in some studies. This approach, however, risks the misapplication of the concepts of individualism and collectivism to create overly-fixed, [...] "caricature-like", oppositional categories. Nonetheless, one study looked at differences in advertising products between an individualistic culture, America, and a collectivist one, South Korea. In American magazine advertisements, it found, there was a greater tendency to stress the distinctiveness and uniqueness of the person; conversely the South Korean ones stressed the importance of social conformity and harmony.
