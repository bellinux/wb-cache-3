5|$|NY83 {{begins at}} US62 in the hamlet of Conewango Valley, {{located in the}} northeastern corner {{of the town of}} Ellington. The route heads north-northwestward, {{paralleling}} a pair of train tracks, and shortly after enters the village <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Creek, where it intersects County Route70 (CR70) and CR68, respectively. Known as Main Street, it bows out to the east slightly, and subsequently takes on a due north path as it heads through the town <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Creek. A couple miles later, it reaches the hamlet of Balcom Corners (located in the town of Villenova), a community situated at the junction of NY83 and the western terminus of NY322. Here, NY83 turns westward toward the community of Hamlet, where it intersects with CR72.|$|E
5|$|Newark {{is divided}} into five {{political}} wards; the East, West, South, North and Central wards and contains neighborhoods ranging in character from bustling urban districts to quiet suburban enclaves.

50|$|In France {{since the}} 1920s, the first <b>cherries</b> <b>of</b> the season always come in march {{from the region}} of Céret, where the local {{producers}} always send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> to the French president of the Republic. In 1938, 45000 out <b>of</b> the 90000 <b>cherry</b> trees <b>of</b> Pyrénées-Orientales are in the canton of Céret. The 25000 cherry trees in Céret only then give 1250 tons <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> each year. In the 1960s, the production <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> in Céret rises up to 3000 tons, before being divided by 11 {{at the end of}} the 2000s.|$|R
50|$|A {{market for}} a {{particular}} commodity is in partial equilibrium if, at the current prices of all commodities, the quantity of the commodity demanded by potential buyers equals the quantity supplied by potential sellers. For example, suppose the current market price <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> is $1 per pound. If all cherry farmers summed together are willing to sell a total of 500 pounds <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> per week at $1 per pound, and if all potential customers summed together are willing to buy 500 pounds <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> in total per week {{when faced with a}} price of $1 per pound, then the market for cherries is in equilibrium because neither shortages nor surpluses <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> exist.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers <b>of</b> chocolate-covered <b>cherries</b> include Marich Confectionery and Cella's. Chukar Cherries {{in central}} Washington state dries 250,000 pounds <b>of</b> <b>cherries</b> {{and creates a}} much richer taste.|$|R
5|$|New York State Route83 (NY83) {{is a state}} route located {{entirely in}} Chautauqua County, New York in the United States. It extends from an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route62 (US62) in the hamlet of Conewango Valley (at the Cattaraugus County border) to NY60 in the hamlet of Laona, near Fredonia. Along the way, NY83 intersects with NY322 at Balcom Corners and serves the village <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Creek.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two {{children}} walking through an post-apocalyptic world, with industrial sites in the background. The two children are barred in with barded wire fences. Hamasaki then appears inside a photo album, singing the song in front <b>of</b> <b>cherry</b> blossom trees. Hamasaki's scenes are inter cuts that are featured throughout the entire video. The two children escape by crawling under the fence, but are being watched by camera surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E

5|$|On November 13, 1982, 15-year-old Scott Safran <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Hill, New Jersey, set a {{world record}} of 41,336,440 points on the arcade game Asteroids, beating the 40,101,910 point score set by Leo Daniels of Carolina Beach on February 6, 1982. In 1998, to congratulate Safran on his accomplishment, the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard searched for him for four years until 2002, when it was {{discovered}} that he had died in an accident in 1989. In a ceremony in Philadelphia on April 27, 2002, Walter Day of Twin Galaxies presented an award to the surviving members of Safran's family, commemorating the Asteroid Champion's achievement. On April 6, 2010, John McAllister broke Safran's record with a high score of 41,338,740 in a 58-hour Internet livestream.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} that initial shoot {{convinced}} Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical {{distribution for the}} completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, entitled Poolside, and construct the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Grove, New York, on Fire Island.|$|E
5|$|When {{formed in}} 1847, Sullivan County had no boroughs. The unincorporated village <b>of</b> <b>Cherry</b> Hill in Cherry Township {{served as the}} first county seat until 1850, when Laporte was founded in the {{geographic}} center of the county, and became its new county seat. In 1850 {{the population of the}} county was 3,694 and it grew steadily to a peak of 12,134 in 1900. This was just after the borough of Eagles Mere was incorporated as the last of the county's municipalities, in 1899. Much of this growth was fueled by lumber-based industry, but the virgin forests were almost all gone by 1900 and the population declined in eight of eleven decades since then, decreasing by a total of 47% between 1900 and 2010.|$|E
