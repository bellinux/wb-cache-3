He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> <b>and</b> indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E

Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, were forced to leave Germany in the same year. After a short stay in England, in 1935 they were invited {{to live in the}} USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice who was responsible for the Moscow show trials and, in his other capacity as Sports Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of chess. In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.|$|E

40|$|The {{growing body}} <b>of</b> {{research}} on <b>discrimination</b> <b>and</b> health indicates a deleterious effect <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> on various health outcomes. However, less {{is known about}} the sociodemographic correlates <b>of</b> reporting racial <b>discrimination</b> <b>and</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> among racially diverse women. We examined the associations of social status characteristics with lifetime experiences <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination</b> <b>and</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> using a racially-diverse sample of 754 women attending family planning clinics in Northern California (11. 4 % African American, 16. 8 % Latina, 10. 1 % Asian and 61. 7 % Caucasian). A multivariate analysis revealed that race, financial difficulty and marital status were significantly correlated with higher reports <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination,</b> while race, education, financial difficulty and nativity were significantly correlated with gender discrimination scores. Our findings suggest that the social patterning <b>of</b> perceiving racial <b>discrimination</b> is somewhat different from that <b>of</b> gender <b>discrimination.</b> This has implications in the realm <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> research <b>and</b> applied interventions, as different forms <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> may have unique covariates that should be accounted for in research analysis or program design...|$|R
