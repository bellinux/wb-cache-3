Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander.

5|$|Since 1900, {{more than}} 15 large dams and many smaller ones {{have been built}} in the Willamette's {{drainage}} basin, and 13 of them are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> and trout; this is despite the dams, other alterations, and pollution (especially on the river's lower reaches). Part of the Willamette Floodplain was established as a National Natural Landmark in 1987 and the river was named as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search <b>of</b> <b>salmon.</b> The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

5|$|Dams {{interrupt}} {{the migration of}} anadromous fish. Salmon and steelhead return to the streams {{in which they were}} born to spawn; where dams prevent their return, entire populations <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> die. Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders, which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream. Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean. Previously, this journey would have taken two to three weeks. With river currents slowed by the dams, and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools, the journey can take several months, which increases the mortality rate. In some cases, the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge. The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia's tributaries entirely block migration, and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams. Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean. In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams, sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The first {{studies for}} {{irrigation}} in the Plain {{were conducted by}} the United States Geological Survey in the late 19thcentury, and the project was authorized on April23, 1904.

However, Minidoka Dam {{was not the only}} dam constructed for the project. As far upstream as Jackson Lake in Wyoming, the Jackson Lake Dam was built in 1907 to raise the lake level for providing additional water storage for dry years. American Falls Dam, upstream of Minidoka, was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978. As the dams were constructed above Shoshone Falls, the historical upriver limit <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> and also a total barrier to boats and ships, no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation. Several other irrigation dams were also built - including Twin Falls Dam and Palisades Dam.|$|E

Abstract: Seasonal stock-specific {{distribution and}} abundance <b>of</b> Chinook <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were determined using scale pattern analysis <b>of</b> Bering-Aleutian <b>Salmon</b> International Survey (BASIS) samples and catch data collected in the western Bering Sea in summer 2003 and fall 2002 – 2004. Chinook salmon were sparsely distributed in this region, which greatly limited the number of samples available for stock identification research. Research trawl catches <b>of</b> immature Chinook <b>salmon</b> were highest in northern areas, and catches throughout the region were dominated by fish in their second ocean summer. Estimated percentages <b>of</b> immature Chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>of</b> North American (Alaska) origin (50. 2 – 71. 2 %) were consistently {{higher than those of}} Asian (Russia) origin. The highest estimated abundance <b>of</b> immature Chinook <b>salmon</b> was in summer 2003 (~ 21 million North American and ~ 20 million Asian fish). These estimates were extraordinarily high compared to adult returns to Asia and North America in 2004 – 2006, and we concluded that BASIS stock assessment methods overestimated the abundance of this species. Nevertheless, our results provided the first quantitative evidence of the extensive distribution <b>of</b> immature Chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>of</b> North American origin in the western Bering Sea in summer and fall. We concluded that the western Bering Sea ecosystem is an important summer–fall foraging area for immature Chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>of</b> both Asian and North American origin. Keywords...|$|R
