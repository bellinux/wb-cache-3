25|$|The horse {{picture in}} the best room {{was seen as an}} artistic {{representation}} of one's own roots in the Swabian Alps and one's own character as a profound kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> consistently ploughs a straight line through life, as the simple denizen of the Swabian Alps might think of himself, but could never have expressed like this painter.|$|E
25|$|That a {{consistent}} psychology {{is required for}} functioning {{in the real world}} also was indicated in the results of The Psychology of Prejudice (2006), wherein people facilitate their functioning in the real world by employing human categories (i.e. sex and gender, age and race, etc.) with which they manage their social interactions with other people. The employment of human categories is integral to a functional scheme of stereotypes (social attitudes) about each category of person, such as generalized prejudices, negative beliefs, ideals, and values about the category <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> is causing the cognitive dissonance.|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{generally}} accepted halakhic definition {{of who is}} a Jew, the Law extended the categories <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> are entitled to immigration and citizenship to the children and grandchildren of Jews, regardless of their present religious affiliation, and their spouses. Also, converts to Judaism whose conversion was performed outside of the State of Israel, regardless of who performed it, were entitled to immigration under the Law. Once again, issues arose as to whether a conversion performed outside of Israel was valid. The variation of the definition in the Law and the definition used by various branches of Judaism has resulted in practical difficulties for many people.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All {{the little things that}} might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> wakes {{up in the morning and}} needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{told her}} friend Oprah Winfrey that the call {{requesting}} her {{to write and}} recite the poem came from television producer Harry Thomason, who organized the inauguration, shortly after Clinton's election. Even though she suspected that Clinton made the request because [...] "he understood that I am the kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> really does bring people together", Angelou admitted feeling overwhelmed, and even requested that the audiences attending her speaking engagements pray for her.|$|E
500|$|British and European psychiatrists {{assessing}} the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971: [...] "The {{information we have}} about [...] suggests {{that he is the}} sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him. But such people often have much to contribute, and deserve considerable respect." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues. The journalist A. N. Wilson quotes Churchill commenting years before that [...] "Tom Driberg is the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> gives sodomy a bad name".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the target}} {{audience}} of Burning Rangers was people who enjoyed action games, the developers also wanted to attract fans of other Sonic Team games. Ohshima stressed that he was aiming at a wider audience and not the type <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> only played Sonic the Hedgehog, adding that [...] "players should recognise the Sonic Team touch immediately" [...] with Burning Rangers. The working title was Firefighter, but it was dropped as the team wanted a [...] "cooler" [...] sounding name. Naka felt that [...] "burning" [...] had a [...] "go for it!" [...] connotation in Japanese, and fit with the disaster-rescue theme. He was initially unsure about having [...] "ranger" [...] in the title as he felt that a ranger referred to park rangers in western culture. The team thought {{that the image of}} a [...] "ranger" [...] also brought to mind the Power Rangers franchise, and after consulting speakers of other languages, Burning Rangers was chosen as the game's name.|$|E

500|$|Selman commented in {{an audio}} {{commentary}} for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] that [...] "the {{thing that really}} got the [...] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart." [...] Greaney identified this version as [...] "the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else {{that they used to}} be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the way he wants it to go." [...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is the kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later." [...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick up and leave.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written in 1955, by Mae Boren Axton, {{a high school teacher}} with a {{background}} in musical promotion, and Jacksonville based singer–songwriter Tommy Durden. The lyrics were based on a report supposedly in The Miami Herald about a man who had destroyed all his identity papers and jumped to his death from a hotel window, leaving a suicide note with the single line, [...] "I walk a lonely street". In 2016, an article in Rolling Stone magazine suggested that the story in reality originated from a report about a painter and petty criminal, Alvin Krolik, whose marriage had failed and who wrote a partial autobiography including the line [...] "This {{is the story of a}} person who walked a lonely street." [...] Krolik's story was published in news media, and received further publicity after he was shot and killed in an attempted robbery in El Paso, Texas. [...] On August 25, 1955, the El Paso Times reported Krolik's death under the headline [...] "Story <b>Of</b> <b>Person</b> <b>Who</b> Walked Lonely Street".|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
500|$|Wu was {{in general}} loyal to Deng Xiaoping's government, but {{continued}} to be an outspoken critic. In 1983, he dismissed Deng's Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign as futile. In September 1986, he read an essay {{at a meeting of}} the China Writers Association entitled [...] "Against Those Who Wield the Scissors—a Plea for an End to Censorship". It was enthusiastically received by the audience, but only a censored version was published, minus 1,000 characters deemed [...] "acrimonious". After the December 1986 student demonstrations, he was pressured to leave the Communist Party in 1987. Retired Politburo member Hu Qiaomu came to his home in person to demand his resignation from the Party. He obliged, as he did not think he was [...] "the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> should be in the Party." [...] In spring 1989, Wu signed a petition calling for greater political freedom. Following the army crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Wu called for a reassessment of the incident, but was forbidden to speak at a CPPCC meeting.|$|E
