5|$|As {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> {{hiring of}} teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted {{to improve education}} quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and {{an overhaul of the}} national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with family or friends. Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, to be provided for at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> churches.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Scottish missionaries saw the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> welfare centres for the British. Rev. W. Macfarlane {{in the early}} 1870s established the first schools in the area. The Scottish University Mission Institution was opened in 1886, followed by the Kalimpong Girls High School. In 1900, Reverend J.A. Graham founded the Dr. Graham's Homes for destitute Anglo-Indian students. By 1907, most schools in Kalimpong started offering education to Indian students. By 1911, the population comprised many ethnic groups, including Nepalis, Lepchas, Tibetans, the Anglo-Indian community and the Marwari communities. Hence by 1911, the population had swollen to 7,880.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> religious, {{cultural}} and sporting facilities including sailing and wind surfing and golf. One popular ancient local tradition involves the Hobby Horse, or Obby Oss, which takes to the streets for four days {{on the eve of}} the first of May each year, with accompanying musicians and rival horses. The town is the starting point of the South West Coast Path National Trail, the nation's longest long-distance countryside walking trail. The Minehead Railway was opened in 1874 and closed in 1971 but has since been reopened as the West Somerset Railway.|$|E
5|$|During the British Raj, Darjeeling's {{temperate}} climate {{led to its}} development as a hill station for British residents seeking to escape the summer heat of the plains. The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and health resort proceeded briskly. Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and Lieutenant Robert Napier were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes and stimulate trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849. The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842. In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850. Commercial cultivation of tea in the district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there. Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the Bengal Presidency after 1864. Scottish missionaries undertook the construction <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in 1881 further hastened {{the development of the}} region. In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major landslides that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{shed light}} on {{representations}} <b>and</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> teachers. 560 young people, aged 18 - 25 and living in a region of Northern Italy, participated in the study. A quantitative survey method using structured questionnaire to obtain the data is employed. In questionnaire participants were asked about: a) evaluation <b>of</b> <b>school</b> experience; b) perceptions <b>of</b> <b>school's</b> effectiveness in reaching traditional goals; c) perceptions <b>of</b> <b>school</b> priorities, goals, problems, activities, responsibilities; d) perceptions of teachers’ professional characteristics; e) perceptions of teachers’ weaknesses. Results show that young people's overall evaluation <b>of</b> both <b>school</b> <b>and</b> teachers is generally positive; however findings suggest that the legitimation <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> teachers is in general weak, especially when we observe perceptions <b>of</b> priorities <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> teachers’ shortcomings. This study indicates the importance of studying young people's representations <b>and</b> perceptions towards <b>school</b> <b>and</b> teachers as the information collected would help administrators and stakeholders to plan and maintain higher level <b>of</b> <b>school</b> effectiveness, teachers’ motivation, authority and legitimacy...|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Pat's passage, the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki {{a disaster}} zone. In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles were sent to the island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages. Through September24, they provided over 100,000litres of clean water. Distribution of 2,050collapsible containers and 200hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross's water pump.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{was born}} on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735 Old Style, Julian calendar) to John Adams Sr. (1691–1761) and Susanna Boylston (1708–1797). He had two younger brothers, Peter and Elihu. Adams' birthplace was then in Braintree, Massachusetts (now Quincy, Massachusetts), and is {{preserved}} at Adams National Historical Park. Adams' mother was from a leading medical family of present-day Brookline, Massachusetts. His father was a deacon in the Congregational Church, a farmer, a cordwainer, and a lieutenant in the militia. His great-grandfather, Henry Adams, emigrated to Massachusetts from Braintree, Essex, England around 1638. John Sr. {{also served as a}} selectman (town councilman) and supervised the building <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship.|$|E

30|$|Overall, we {{find that}} the lower quality <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> work {{experience}} more than negates the endowment advantage that immigrants have in these areas. Indeed, based on observed years <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>and</b> observed years <b>of</b> work experience alone, male immigrants should earn 9.1 percent more than natives, but lower quality <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>and</b> work experience subtracts 15.3 percent from that (the equivalent figures are respectively 6.0 percent and 17.0 percent for female immigrants). Of the total human capital quality effect, 75 percent is accounted for by differences in GDP per capita for males and 50 percent for females.|$|R

5|$|The Kiautschou Bay concession, as {{it became}} known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the {{imperial}} province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (Schantung-Halbinsel) in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E
