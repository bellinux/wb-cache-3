40|$|Political controversies {{associated}} with individual fishing quota (“IFQ”) programs have impaired IFQ implementation. As an alternative, U. S. fishermen have sought rationalization through private ordering. Their {{ability to do}} so is subject to U. S. antitrust law, under which agreements among competitors allocating resource outputs are typically considered “per se” violations. However, where (i) a discrete fishery quota is fully utilized, (ii) the participating producers can demonstrate that a joint harvesting arrangement will increase their production, and (iii) joint activity is limited to allocating harvesting rights among association members, private harvesting share arrangements have proven to be pro-competitive with respect to consumer interests. Consistent with this conclusion, associations of fishing companies allocating harvesting rights in the U. S. Pacific whiting and Bering Sea pollock fisheries among their members have received favorable antitrust law reviews from the U. S. Department of Justice. This paper summarizes the incentives and conditions for forming harvesting cooperatives, reviews relevant antitrust law developments, and briefly examines the fishery management and market implications of harvesting cooperatives as an alternative to IFQs. Key words: fishery rationalization, individual fishing quotas, harvesting cooperatives, antitrust law, American Fisheries Act 1.

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Regulating fishing trough overall catch limits, {{sometimes}} referred to as olympic fishing, has been heavily criticized by fisheries economists for its unhealthy incentives for overcapacity, excessive costs, quantity focus and uneven supply patterns. In spite of this the Icelandic government opened an <b>olympic</b> style coastal <b>fishery</b> for small scale vessels in 2008. This was in response to years of lobbying by certain groups of fishermen and their heavy criticism of the quota regulation of Iceland. The fishery is ongoing and is now about 9000 tons, of mostly cod. It is limited to the summer months of May, June, July and August where a separate overall catch limit is put on each month for four districts. There is further a limit on both vessel size and daily catch. This paper analyses the economic outcome of this experiment. It analyses the profitability of the fishery compared to the quota regulated coastal fishery as well as the industrial fishery. The analysis uses the detailed economic data on profitability of fleet sections generated yearly by statistics Iceland. The paper focuses also on the empirical data on impact of the Icelandic olympic coastal fishing on short run fish supply, quality and fish prices. The results firmly confirm the general consensus among economists that olympic fishing is wasteful and leads to very poor economic outcomes. The way the fishery is organized leads to oversupply in the first days of each summer month, with suppressed prices, and inferior catch quality...|$|R
