2500|$|By 23 December MacArthur {{had decided}} to {{evacuate}} Manila and on Christmas Eve he, {{his family and his}} headquarters evacuated the city aboard Don Esteban in early evening with the flames of over a million gallons of Navy fuel <b>oil</b> <b>lighting</b> the sky. The ship landed the headquarters on Corregidor at 9:30 that night. During the further evacuation of Manila the ship transported medical personnel and those patients not able to board the improvised hospital ship Mactan to field hospitals in Bataan. Don Esteban continued evacuating personnel and supplies from the now open city of Manila to Bataan and Corregidor with a final departure assisting in removing Philippine government officials and the country's reserve gold and currency. On 19 February 1942 the ship departed with a party composed of Philippine officials, including vice president, Sergio Osmeña, to safety. After making contact with a submarine the ship went to Iloilo where the President briefly boarded until daylight when the ship departed for [...] Cebu City to load supplies for Corrigedor. Shortly after departure the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft and the ship was ordered abandoned by [...] Captain Afable as the damage was severe and a cargo of gasoline was leaking. Survivors saw the ship erupt in flames after bombers returned along with Japanese surface vessels. The ship is shown in official records as being lost on 2 March 1942.|$|E
50|$|In 1881 the Police Headquarters was {{destroyed}} by fire which {{was caused by the}} kerosene <b>oil</b> <b>lighting</b> system. The Police Headquarters {{was destroyed}} for a second time in 1990, this time during the attempted coup. A new Police Administration Building was constructed at the corner of Edward and Sackville Streets the following year housing Administrative offices.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} built in the 14th century, {{although}} there is some stonework in the north wall which dates from the 12th century and was part of an earlier building. The nave was refenestrated in the 15th century. The tower was repaired in the early 19th century when the gallery was also moved. Further restoration was carried out in the 1850s, when <b>oil</b> <b>lighting</b> was installed and further restored and re-roofed 1912 to 1913. The vestry was extended and the west end gallery removed 1934-1936.|$|E
50|$|Street lamps in {{the city}} were {{introduced}} in 1785. Until the introduction of electric street lighting, the street lighting was done by <b>oil</b> <b>lights.</b> Till 1857, there were only 200 <b>oil</b> <b>light</b> lamps. By the year 1910, this was increased to 6,500. In 1910, electric street lighting was introduced. By 1924-1925, all the <b>oil</b> <b>lights</b> {{in the streets of}} the city were completely replaced by electric lights. The Corporation also maintains 264 high-mast lights and 133 8-meter and 12-meter lamp posts with cluster lights at important junctions. The Corporation owns 22 hydraulic vehicles for attending maintenance work to streetlights. In 2012, the Corporation started installing 60,000 streetlights in the newly included zones, in addition to replacing about 88,000 old streetlights in these zones. Per the norm of the Corporation, the minimum distance between two adjacent streetlights is 25 metre.|$|R

50|$|In 1805, Balthasar von Campenhausen was {{appointed}} Governor of Taganrog, where he created: the Taganrog Customs district; the new slope to the haven; new stone storehouses for goods; started construction of coasting vessels for {{transportation of goods}} to other Russian ports on Black and Azov Seas; inaugurated the navigation school, the commercial gymnasium and the commercial court; opened the first drugstore and introduced the posts of the city doctor and city midwife; opened the construction and building committee that planned the future city architectural development; introduced <b>oil</b> <b>lighting</b> in the streets; started the paving and greening of the streets; in April 1806 founded the City Park. Two streets in Taganrog were later named after Campenhausen: Bolshoy Campenhausenskiy (now: Comsomolskiy) and Malo-Campenhausenskiy (now: Spartakovskiy).|$|E
50|$|The inquiry {{made several}} recommendations. Most {{concerned}} {{the enforcement of}} regulations on drivers, firemen, guards and signalmen to ensure closer attention to their primary duty; the care and safety of trains. The more extensive use of Automatic Train Control (ATC), then under extended trial on the Great Western Railway, was discussed. This would sound a siren in the cab to alert the crew of a train if they passed a signal at danger or caution and then automatically apply the brakes if they failed to acknowledge and cancel the warning. Signalboxes should be fitted with detonator placers, to alert engine crews who missed signals or were unable to observe them in fog or thick weather. Electric lighting was clearly safer than gas <b>oil</b> <b>lighting,</b> and steel-framed carriages {{were less likely to}} be crushed than wooden-framed stock.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates {{and compares}} {{the effect of}} {{fractional}} flow curves on the heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> recoveries in a petroleum reservoir. Fingering of flowing water {{is one of the}} serious problems of the oil displacement by water and another problem is the estimation of the amount of recover oil from a petroleum reservoir. To address these problems, the fractional flow of heavy <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> are investigated. The fractional flow approach treats the multi-phases flow rate as a total mixed fluid and then describes the individual phases as fractional of the total flow. Laboratory experiments are implemented for two different types of oils, heavy <b>oil,</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> to experimentally obtain relative permeability and fractional flow curves. Application of the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> fractional curve, which exhibits a regular S-shape, to the water flooding method showed that a large amount of mobile oil in the reservoir is displaced by water injection. In contrast, the fractional flow curve of heavy oil does not display an S-shape because of its high viscosity. Although the advance of the injected waterfront is faster than in <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs, a significant amount of mobile oil remains behind the waterfront...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the first}} rally of the season, the 2008 Monte Carlo Rally, Atkinson scored his first podium finish on tarmac, after a close battle with François Duval while Solberg {{finished}} in fifth. In the 2008 Swedish Rally, Solberg finished in fourth place while Atkinson finished in 21st position following a spin on Special Stage 3, which cost him over 15 minutes. Immediately after the Swedish Rally, the team completed a gravel test in Spain, {{in preparation for}} Rally Mexico, the last test using the WRC2007 car. [...] At the 2008 Rally Mexico, Atkinson placed second, his best ever result. [...] Solberg was forced to retire {{on the second day}} after a driveshaft failure to his front left wheel. He continued under SupeRally rules on Sunday, finishing 12th. Going into {{the final day of the}} 2008 Rally Argentina, Solberg and Atkinson were comfortably in second and third position, poised to put two cars on the podium, a feat Subaru has not accomplished in several years. However, on Special Stage 19, Petter's car suffered an electrical failure, forcing him to retire. Atkinson inherited Solberg's position, and achieved a second-place finish for the second consecutive time. At the 2008 Jordan Rally, on SS6, Solberg's retired after his Impreza suffered from a damper failure, which then spilled <b>oil,</b> <b>lighting</b> a fire under the hood of the car. Solberg restarted under SupeRally rules on Saturday, but crashed on the day's final stage after brake problems. Atkinson managed to secure a third podium in a row, following the suspension failure of Latvala, and the retirements of Solberg and Loeb.|$|E

30|$|In the Tahe {{oilfield}} in China, {{heavy oil}} is commonly lifted using the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology. However, {{due to the}} lack of <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> the production of heavy oil has been seriously limited. Thus, a new compound technology of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending and electric heating is discussed in this paper, which aims to reduce the usage of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and maintain heavy oil production. Based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation, a pressure and temperature coupling model is developed. The heat-transfer parameters are calculated by using Hasan–Kabir method and the pressure drop is calculated by using Hagedorn–Brown method. The model also considers the blend effect of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and heavy oil, and the heating effect of electric rod. Example calculation shows that only electric heating or <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> blending technology cannot meet the requirement. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> used can be reduced by combining the electric heating technology.|$|R

50|$|Another {{contributing}} factor that enhances oil production during steam injection {{is related to}} near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the viscosity that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude <b>oil</b> <b>light</b> ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil.|$|R

40|$|High {{viscosity}} of some {{crude oil}} makes difficult to recover with primary or secondary production methods. Therefore, thermal oil recovery techniques are recommended for the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) of heavy oil. In this experimental study, steam injection {{was used to}} investigate the effectiveness parameters on heavy oil production rate. The result is shown that, by increasing pressure, steam reaches the breakthrough point sooner, but recovery decreases. If the oils are a little different in viscosity, recovery in the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> is more than that in heavy oil. Also in the highly viscous <b>oils</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oils,</b> recovery in the heavy oil {{is much higher than}} in <b>light</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{focusing}} on combustion characteristics for small diesel engine by using emulsified blend fuels of vegetable <b>oil</b> and <b>light</b> <b>oil.</b> Target is to achieve low emissions and low fuel consumption for internal combustion engines. The fuels {{used in this study}} are <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> blend fuels [light oil + coconut <b>oil,</b> <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> + palm oil], and emulsified fuels [light oil + water, blend fuels + water]. Mean increasing rate of pressure is calculated from the value which subtracted initial pressure from maximum burning pressure divided by total burning time. The mean increasing ratio of pressure is calculated from the value which subtracted initial pressure from maximum burning pressure divided by the total burning time. The emissions in exhaust gas are measured with an analyzer of exhaust gas. The data of 30 tests for each engine revolutions were averaged arithmetically. Experimental approach and results have been presented by details. The main conclusions are as follows: it is possible to control the combustion behaviour by using blend fuels and emulsified blend fuels for small diesel engine; the maximum burning pressure of emulsified blend fuels increases at low engine speed; the CO emission of blend fuels is smaller than that of light oil; the NOX emission of emulsified coconut blend fuel and emulsified palm blend fuel is smaller than that of light oil; the CO emission of emulsified Coconut-Palm blend fuel is equal to that of <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> at low engine speed...|$|R
