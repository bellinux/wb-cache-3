2500|$|The reedited album {{proved to}} be very {{difficult}} to make, as the master tapes featured many accidental splices. The reedited version also incorporated additional musical content not on the original release of the album, including previously recorded surf music; including a 1963 Zappa-produced demo recording of a tune that later appeared in a 1967 recording under the title [...] "Take Your Clothes <b>Off</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Dance" [...] on We're Only in It for the Money. Some of the editing was done in Zappa's living room. On the 1967 and 1968 releases of the album, Zappa was credited as [...] "Francis Vincent Zappa", as Zappa had believed that this was his real name. He later learned that his birth name was Frank Vincent Zappa, and this mistake was subsequently corrected in reissues of the album.|$|E

30|$|The signal at the {{crossing}} was <b>off,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{could not stop}} anymore, the signal started flashing.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{you talk}} to me as though I were a child," [...] she laughed. [...] "Well, good-bye, everybody, then. You see, my stern husband is taking me <b>off.</b> <b>When</b> are <b>you</b> coming to see me, Doctor Harrison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} take you to supper, and you can send me <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> like afterwards," [...] he said and started across the square. A famous {{restaurant}} was not far off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{forgot about}} that; I was just <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> spoke, and didn't quite take it in. We are quite {{out of the}} current; the water is moving very sluggishly past us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{begin as}} soon as you like. You needn't leave <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see me getting drowsy (unless you feel tired), for it's {{pleasant}} to wake gradually to the sounds again. Did you ever try that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{the chart}} {{we should be}} well east of Los Lobos island, d'ye see?" [...] he said impatiently. [...] "You don't happen to {{remember}} {{the direction of the}} current <b>off</b> shore <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were running up here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL [coming back to him, triumphant] Now you're talking! I thought you'd come <b>off</b> it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw {{a chance}} of getting back a bit of what you chucked at me last night. [Confidentially] You'd had a drop in, hadn't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{blame you}} a bit, Esmeralda," [...] said Clayton, [...] "and you {{certainly}} did hit it <b>off</b> right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> called them 'lonesome' noises. I {{never have been}} able to find the right word for them but that's it, don't you know, lonesome noises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendid. So much {{healthier}} for us out in {{the open}} like this than frowsting in bed. I had just dropped <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> did your bell-ringing act. For it was you, my sweet child, who rang that bell, was knot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will think}} {{differently}} some day, {{and you will}} have a good wife, Tom," [...] I said. [...] "We'll miss you both badly at Crane Valley, but must try to give you a good start <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> take up your preëmpted land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{said the}} blacksmith, [...] "by {{the time you}} got back to your ship you had overstayed your leave of absence a good while. Did your captain let you <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> told him this story of the new-fashioned Water-devil?" ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} to take <b>off</b> your amulets <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were bathing, {{this is to}} ensure the water would not damage the amulet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thankee," [...] said he; [...] "then we'll {{consider}} that it's to come <b>off,</b> <b>when</b> convenient to <b>you.</b> Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} a liking to you," [...] he continued; [...] "you don't fly <b>off,</b> screeching, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see a party, and your hair doesn't stand on end. You've no idea," [...] he said, [...] "how sick I am of seeing people's hair {{standing}} on end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{wrong on}} one point," [...] Batley objected dryly. [...] "I'm acquainted with your temperament--it's {{not one that}} would lead you into avoidable difficulties. Well, you came through and your cousin died, but you failed to pay me <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came into possession." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{it was a}} case of clawing {{away from}} the fort, which was not easy, since the wind that had brought us down so finely, now blew {{directly}} in our teeth, and the pungy was a master-hand for sliding <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tried to tack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Understand me," [...] she said, fixing {{her great}} languid eyes upon his {{in a fashion}} that made him {{exceedingly}} uncomfortable, [...] "understand, Vernoon, {{that if you go}} out anywhere, it must be in your mask, which you can only put <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are alone with me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{intruder}} detection {{or access}} control system {{could be used in}} conjunction with light level sensors to turn lights on and <b>off.</b> So <b>when</b> <b>you</b> walk into a dark room the lights turn on (if you are allowed to be there) and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> leave they turn off behind you, thus making energy savings by preventing lights from being left on.|$|R
5000|$|Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper (D) {{released}} a statement declaring Trump's withdrawal a [...] "serious mistake" [...] and likening the decision to [...] "ripping <b>off</b> your parachute <b>when</b> <b>you</b> should be pulling the ripcord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Stivergill. [...] "Put 'em <b>off.</b> Fulfil 'em <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come back. At all events," [...] she continued, {{seeing that}} Miss Lillycrop still hesitated, [...] "come {{for a night}} or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "we'll count you {{full time}} to-day, but there's the four days <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> got crushed by that redwood, and the week when you chopped your leg. Then, {{counting}} the amount for your board, that's thirty-six dollars I'm due to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That’s {{a little}} harder. I suppose you never {{felt as if}} you were full of explosives, and could go <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> wanted and scatter {{destruction}} around. A torpedo doesn’t appear a very terrible thing, you know. It’s nice and round and shiny. I’ve seen one. Julian showed it me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a kind of}} a cripples' circus, eh? Well, Toby boy, you can do as {{you want}} to, an' you shall have old Whitey; {{but it seems to me}} you'd better tie her lame leg on, or she'll shake it <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get to makin' her cut up antics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{your hat}} <b>off,</b> <b>you</b> blackguard, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{speak to a}} lady," [...] she said, and tossed his hat in an instant, across a ditch by which they were standing, into a pool on the other side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O yes,' she anxiously replied. 'I--didn't mean to {{make you}} think I had no heart.' At this Bob {{inclined}} his countenance towards hers. 'No,' she said, smiling through two incipient tears as she drew back. 'You are to show good behaviour for six months, and you must promise not to frighten me again by running <b>off</b> <b>when</b> I--show <b>you</b> how badly you have served me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{at least}} let my brother {{thank you for taking}} his place--in rescuing me. It was so {{thoughtful}} in you to put <b>off</b> at once <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw I was surrounded. I might have been in great danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nipping on {{a couple}} of detonators," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "Stand clear of the one on the deck. They're lined with mercury fulminate, and you want to take your shoes <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come near that. Giant powder's {{innocent}} by comparison. I mean to try a stick or two of this consignment." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{and longer}} pause, {{during which the}} ticking of the clock became painful in the {{intensity}} of the silence it seemed to be measuring. [...] "Jane, what's off!" [...] "Why, your boots, to be sure," [...] replied the petulant woman, losing patience; [...] "I pulled them <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first lay down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Set <b>off</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will, and {{see to it}} {{that the}} paper is {{delivered}} safely, although that which it contains is so worded as to convey little of importance to an enemy," [...] he added carelessly, and turned from us as if {{to say that he was}} done with speaking, therefore we might go when it pleased us best.|$|E
6000|$|... "I forbade Dr. Barry {{to take it}} <b>off,</b> Richard, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> lay {{so white}} and still. I knew then that you had been true to me, despite what I had heard. And {{if you were to}} die--" [...] her voice broke a little as she passed her hand over my brow, [...] "if you were to die, my single comfort would have been that you wore it then." ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{put on his}} hat. His eyes {{rested on}} Hugh, {{with a look of}} diabolical malice: [...] "The time is not far <b>off,</b> Mr. Mountjoy, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> may be sorry you refused me." [...] He said those words deliberately--and took his leave.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{know him}} by sight,' said Mrs Brown, whose working mouth and nodding head stopped for the moment, in the fixedness of her attention. 'We saw him pass this morning, afore he got <b>off</b> his horse; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{were ready to}} take it.' ...|$|R
