60|$|For the Lepidoptera I first noted all {{the species}} and {{varieties}} marked as British only in Staudinger's Catalogue of European Lepidoptera. This list was carefully corrected by Mr. Stainton, who weeded {{out all the}} species known by him to have been since discovered, and furnished me with valuable information on the distribution and habits of the species. This information often has a direct bearing on the probability of the insect being peculiar to Britain, {{and in some cases}} may be said to explain why it should be so. For example, the larvæ of some of our peculiar species of Tineina feed during the winter, which they are enabled to do owing to our mild and insular climate, but which the severer continental winters render impossible. A curious example of the effect this habit may have on distribution is afforded by one of our commonest British species, Elachista rufocinerea, the larva <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>mines</b> in the leaves of Holcus mollis and other grasses from December to March. This species, though common everywhere with us, extending to Scotland and Ireland, is quite unknown in similar latitudes on the continent, but appears again in Italy, the South of France, and Dalmatia, where the mild winters enable it to live in its accustomed manner.|$|E

60|$|The above {{analysis}} of a thought, though I {{believe it to be}} mistaken, is very useful as affording a schema in terms <b>of</b> <b>which</b> other theories can be stated.

50|$|On 20 July 2010 the Government {{announced}} that {{in response to}} receiving 37,552 submissions, the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>which</b> opposed <b>mining,</b> it will not remove any land from Schedule 4.|$|R
50|$|Other {{problems}} {{were caused by}} {{the location of the}} ore deposits. If a deposit extended over two territories, there could be disagreements at the state border. The mining operators often ended up in conflict. Because different organizations were responsible {{on either side of the}} border, there was the question <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>mining</b> jurisdiction (mining court or Berggericht) was responsible for handling a case. These disputes could adversely affect the relationship between the territorial princes as well as the local mining industry. The situation was aided slightly, if the powers of one mining court were greater than those of the other.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 the New Zealand Government {{proposed}} removing {{some national}} park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 {{protection of the}} Crown Minerals Act <b>which</b> prohibits <b>mining</b> in those areas.

50|$|The Bearpaw Formation {{is famous}} for its well-preserved ammonite fossils. These include Placenticeras meeki and Placenticeras intercalare, and the baculite Baculites compressus, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are <b>mined</b> south-central Alberta to produce the organic {{gemstone}} ammolite.|$|R
50|$|Mining cooperatives {{and other}} {{miscellaneous}} miners {{made up the}} rest of the producers in the mining sector, although their output was aggregated with that of the small mining sector. The National Federation of Mining Cooperatives of Bolivia (Federación Nacional de Cooperativas Mineras de Bolivia) served as an umbrella organization for the country's 434 mining cooperatives, 82 percent <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>mined</b> gold. Only a few of these groups, however, were officially registered with the National Institute of Cooperatives (Instituto Nacional para Cooperativas). Most cooperatives were small and consisted of individual miners organized by mine or specific mineral and using very little technology.|$|R

40|$|Zambia and China have nurtured their {{relationship}} that date {{back more than}} four decades ago. This paper looks at the effects of the Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) on the Zambian labour market. China being the major player in Zambia’s economy is expected to create jobs for the locals who in turn will improve the economy of the country. It is evident that China has increased its FDI inflow to Zambia in the last decade <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>mining</b> and construction sectors have received the lions share. The numbers of jobs created by Chinese FDI have also been increasing steadily in the past 10 years especially in the construction and mining industries. However, the paper does not investigate on the quality of both FDI and jobs...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{potentially}} {{large number of}} applications of real-time data stream mining in scientific and business analysis, the real-time data streams mining has drawn attention of many researchers who are working {{in the area of}} machine learning and data mining. In many cases, for real-time data stream mining online learning is used. Environments that require online learning are non-stationary and whose underlying distributions may change over time i. e. concept drift, because <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>mining</b> <b>of</b> real- time data streams with concept drifts is quite challenging. However, ensemble methods have been suggested for this particular situation. This paper reviews various online methods of drift detection. We also present some results of our experiments that show the comparison of some online drift detection (concept drift) methods...|$|R
