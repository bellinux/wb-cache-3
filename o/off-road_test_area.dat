40|$|Abstract This thesis for the bachelors degree {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and subsequent evaluation of the fawn mortality during haymaking in the hunting district HS Kalec, county Plzeň-sever (Pilsen-North), located {{in the western part}} of the Czech Republic. The first part of this thesis describes Roe Deer (Capreolus Capreolus), its population in this territory, biology, ethology and its management. The second part describes the project as such involving three model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> that were selected and marked out in the hunting district HS Kalec; before the haymaking time from June 15 to June 24, 2015, adequate protection measures were undertaken in these areas. Locality of the first model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 1 was attended (walked) by gamekeepers with dogs. Locality of the second model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 2 was treated with the game scent repeller and also equipped with acoustic disturber. The third model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 was only monitored. These model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were re-visited after hay crop and the result is that in the vicinity of the model <b>testing</b> <b>area</b> number 3 two fawns were cut and killed. In both other model <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> no cut fawns were found. After hay crop and subsequent determining the actual number of cut fawns, these <b>testing</b> <b>areas</b> were compared mutually and the results will be stated in this thesis for the bachelors degree. The essential aspect was to evaluate the fawns mortality in the specific hunting district based on the obtained facts. Relation to the mitigation measures set in place was examined. This work resulted in saving three fawns. Outcomes of this thesis have provided rather interesting findings that can be further exploited in the gamekeeping management. Particularly in relation to the roe deer management in the gamekeeping practice. Keywords/tags: roe deer, fawns, killing, hunting district (HS Kalec, Žihle...|$|R

30|$|The {{conception}} of a GMP monitoring program - selection of <b>test</b> <b>areas,</b> appropriate indicators, methods, farmers' clarification, etc. - should start far earlier than the GMP cropping. Importantly, the initial sampling design has to consider that farmers may deny work on their private properties. A total of 1, 360 involved farmers were informed about the project BINATS. Sixty-nine of these denied work on their fields. Twenty-seven of the 100 pre-selected <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> were affected by this prohibition. Twenty-one of these <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> could be retained by shifting survey circles appropriately [48]. Six <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> had to be shifted as a whole along the Austrian forest inventory raster.

Taking three geomorphological units {{in different parts of}} the loess as <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> and 5 m-resolution DEMs as original test date, this paper employed the changed ROC-LV (Lucian, 2010) in judging the optimal scales in the slope segmentation process. The experiment results showed that this method is effective in determining the optimal scale in the slope segmentation. The results also showed that the slope segmentation of the different geomorphological units require different optimal scales because the landform complexity is varied. The three <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require the same scale which could distinguish the small gully because all the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> have many gullies of the same size, however, when come to distinguish the basins, since the complexity of the three areas is different, the <b>test</b> <b>areas</b> require different scales...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Driving is an {{important}} part of everyday life and represents independence. Activities, both productive and social, may be affected if a person can no longer drive. Older drivers, as a group, have a low crash rate. On the other hand, driving may be affected by medical conditions in this group, for example dementia or stroke, which often call into question a person’s fitness to drive. However, there are older drivers who may benefit from compensatory strategies to prevent driving cessation. Aim The aim of the thesis was to examine driving assessments methods, both off-and on-road tests, and if an intervention may improve driving behaviour for older adults. The specific aims were to: examine how occupational therapists (OTs) are involved in driving assessments in Sweden, what methods are used and how these assessments are performed; determine whether the commonly used cognitive test battery, the NorSDSA, could predict an on-road test results for stroke and cognitive deficits/dementia participants; investigate driving errors characteristic in older drivers without cognitive impairments and identify relationships between <b>off-road</b> and on-road <b>tests</b> results; investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve driving behaviour of older and younger drivers. Methods In Study I, a questionnaire was sent to 154 geriatric, rehabilitation and neurological clinics and additionally directly to 19 OTs. In Study II, data consisted of test results from 195 clients who had completed a fitness to drive assessment. In Study III, 85 older volunteer drivers were assessed regarding their vision, cognition and driving behaviour. In Study IV, 31 older drivers and 32 younger drivers were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. Results Driving assessments were carried out by OTs in various manners and diverse methods were used. Most OTs used <b>off-road</b> tests; <b>tests</b> developed specifically for driving assessments or un-standardised activity assessments. Even though few <b>off-road</b> <b>tests</b> can predict driving performance, only 19 % of the OTs used on-road <b>test.</b> The <b>off-road</b> <b>test</b> NorSDSA could neither predict an outcome of an on-road test for stroke clients, nor for cognitive deficits/dementia clients. Some of the older volunteer drivers displayed questionable driving behaviour, although they were fit to drive and a total of 21 % failed the on-road test. Using automatic instead of manual transmission was shown to improve older, but not younger drivers’ driving behaviour. Conclusions For OTs in Sweden, driving assessments are challenging, since there are no specified guidelines regarding the appropriate assessment tools. Assessors often solely rely on cognitive test(s) when assessing their clients. NorSDSA should not be used as a stand-alone test when determining fitness to drive. The lack of guidelines can be problematic for OTs, but also for the clients, since there is a risk that they do not receive a valid and reliable assessment. To perform these kinds of assessments there is a need for specialised training. On-road assessments are seen as the gold standard but that standard needs to encompass driving problems or errors that are “normal” driving behaviours in older persons. To switch from manual to automatic transmission may be a way to assist older drivers to continue driving and maintain the quality of their transport mobility...|$|R

40|$|Behavior mapping (BM) is {{a spatial}} data {{collection}} technique {{in which the}} locational and behavioral information of a user is noted on a plan layout of the studied environment. Among many indoor positioning technologies, we chose Wi-Fi, BLE beacon and ultra-wide band (UWB) sensor technologies for their popularity and investigated their applicability in BM. We tested three technologies for error ranges and found an average error of 1. 39 m for Wi-Fi in a 36 m 2 <b>test</b> <b>area</b> (6 m × 6 m), 0. 86 m for the BLE beacon in a 37. 44 m 2 <b>test</b> <b>area</b> (9. 6 m × 3. 9 m) and 0. 24 m for ultra-wide band sensors in a 36 m 2 <b>test</b> <b>area</b> (6 m × 6 m).
