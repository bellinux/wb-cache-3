5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} First Serbian Uprising, by 1813 the Ottomans had reoccupied vast areas of Serbia {{that had once been}} under rebel control and {{captured}} Belgrade. Once Serbia was firmly in their control, the Ottomans carried out numerous revenge killings throughout the countryside. Following these attacks, the Grand Vizier declared an amnesty, and many Serbs who had gone into hiding returned to their homes. Given Serbia's lack of good roads, the Ottomans had to rely <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the former Serb rebels, such as Stanoje Glavaš and Miloš Obrenović, to maintain order and collect taxes on their behalf. This arrangement remained unchanged until early 1815, when the Ottomans turned <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the former rebels and killed them. Rumours of an impending Ottoman assault spread quickly throughout Serbia. In April 1815, on Palm Sunday, Serb elders and leaders met in the village of Takovo and elected Obrenović their leader. Shortly afterwards, the Serbs rose in revolt, inflicting a series of humiliating defeats on the Ottomans, in what {{came to be known as}} the Second Serbian Uprising. In subsequent peace treaties, the Serbs were granted autonomy, and Obrenović was recognized as the Prince of Serbia.|$|E

They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985. They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his father's last projects, and Kazuko, a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.|$|E
