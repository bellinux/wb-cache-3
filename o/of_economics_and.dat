5|$|The Paris region hosts France's highest {{concentration}} of the grandes √©coles ‚Äì 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered grands √©tablissements. Most of the grandes √©coles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses {{much larger than the}} old campuses within the crowded city of Paris, though the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement. There are a high number of engineering schools, led by the Paris Institute of Technology which comprises several colleges such as √âcole Polytechnique, √âcole des Mines, AgroParisTech, T√©l√©com Paris, Arts et M√©tiers, and √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es. There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC, and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is still located in Paris's 7th arrondissement and the most prestigious university <b>of</b> <b>economics</b> <b>and</b> finance, Paris-Dauphine, is located in Paris's 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA department of the Paris-Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

5|$|The first {{sociology}} {{department to}} be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School <b>of</b> <b>Economics</b> <b>and</b> Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology) in 1904. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and Edvard Westermarck became the lecturers in the discipline at the University of London in 1907. Harriet Martineau, an English translator of Comte, has been cited as the first female sociologist. In 1909 the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Soziologie (German Sociological Association) was founded by Ferdinand T√∂nnies and Max Weber, among others. Weber established the first department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919, having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology. In 1920, Florian Znaniecki set up the first department in Poland. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the Frankfurt School of critical theory) was founded in 1923. International co-operation in sociology began in 1893, when Ren√© Worms founded the , an institution later eclipsed by the much larger International Sociological Association (ISA), founded in 1949.|$|E
