This paper presents {{a case study}} of capacity assessment at the local level. Capacity evaluation methods are presented, with emphasis on the theoretical framework used to guide the evaluation. The capacity evaluation framework presented herein was theoretically based and designed to generate practical information to facilitate the adoption of a locally tailored youth obesity prevention program, VERB(TM) Summer Scorecard (VSS). Using multiple methods, four aspects of community capacity were assessed, including community, knowledge and skills, resources, and power. Within each category, factors that facilitated or impeded program implementation were distinguished. The evaluation protocol was designed to generate information increasing community capacity to sustain a community-based obesity prevention program. Capacity tables were used as a program-planning tool and as a system for sharing implementation and sustainability requirements with potential adopters. This case study also explores how to use capacity assessment results to empower coalitions to serve as catalysts for development of local programs in other communities. ...|$|E

30|$|Additional {{lessons for}} Green Toxicology {{can be learned}} from past product {{development}} and production through the application of the precautionary principle [17, 18]. The precautionary principle is applied in situations when harm to either the environment or human life {{does not need to be}} conclusively proven in order for risk to be addressed through discretionary decisions and policies. In some instances, the precautionary principle, often observed, is not distinguished from a “right”, which is respected and is a statutory requirement in some European Union member states [44]. In this respect, Green Toxicology can incorporate the precautionary principle by limiting the suspect or potential adverse toxicological consequences during the discovery, development and production of safer and more sustainable products. As such, knowledge about the previous selection of occupational, public health and environmental hazards can be examined to determine if further or earlier measures could have been employed to prevent harm (e.g. methyl tert-butyl ether replacement of lead in petrol; [16]). This concept is known as “late lessons from early warnings” and is often associated with the precautionary principle. Although often neglected, the precautionary principle <b>offers</b> <b>many</b> <b>lessons</b> and improvements that can be of use to developing products that are less harmful and should be a main driving force behind not only Green Toxicology but also Green Chemistry.|$|R

Data from 28 in-depth, partially structured interviews, conducted during two field visits ending 21 {{weeks after the}} earthquake, were included in a case study. The data analysis revealed the MFM was severely inadequate. One interviewee, a senior UN official, stated, "There was no fatality management.

40|$|Uganda, {{the pearl}} of Africa, takes {{great pride in}} its Universal Primary Education (UPE) system. In 1996, the {{government}} pledged to pay the tuition fees of four children per family, later extending this pledge to all children enrolled at government-aided schools. Over the following decade, dramatic increases were recorded in access to primary education. Uganda thus {{came very close to}} achieving universal enrolment and gender parity. Many refer to Uganda as a success story, an exceptional case in a continent which has some of the lowest enrolment rates and largest gender disparities in the world. However, since UPE’s primary objective is access to primary education, it has overshadowed issues relating to educational quality. Consequently, as some recent studies have revealed, the quality of education has declined, raising serious concerns among policymakers, educationalists and parents. There is indeed a widespread perception among Ugandans, particularly among parents, that the quality of education has suffered because of UPE. This has weakened parental confidence in education. Furthermore, despite rising numbers of primary school graduates, places at post-primary level remained limited. Therefore, as many Ugandans acknowledge, ‘lack of a future after UPE’ remains a deterrent to participation in primary education. The Ugandan experience <b>offers</b> <b>many</b> <b>lessons</b> to other developing countries, illustrating the importance of mobilising political will, national commitment and resources to achieve educational goals. Yet it also demonstrates that, unless simultaneous measures are taken to improve educational quality and expand educational opportunities at post-primary level, a focus on access to primary education may yield only limited results. Furthermore, vital interactions and synergies exist between various education subsectors, and a focus on one sub-sector may well limit the benefits of such synergies. A holistic understanding of the education system and prioritisation beyond primary level will be vital if these concerns are to be adequately addressed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the most}} {{developed}} countries, {{it is necessary}} to bring about significant changes to health care delivery through the strengthening of prevention, rehabilitation and the integration of the social and healthcare dimensions. This means moving the policy focus from “treating” to “taking care” of the sick in a broader and more integrated way, one which is more closely linked to the World Health Organization’s definition of health as physical, psychological and social well-being. This change involves the delivery of care for the elderly. Developed countries are confronting this issue by using different community-based programs to integrate acute and long-term care services for frail elderly individuals with complex health needs. The objective of this health policy article is to give an overview of the most recent initiatives on long-term care management for the elderly including normative, funding and organizational issues in the USA, as their public health system largely differs from those of the Western European countries. Particular attention is given to the PACE (Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly), which applies a comprehensive approach to managing the care of the frail elderly population and would represent a new framework in geriatric care. By incorporating a central core care team to manage the needs of each elderly individual, this approach recognizes the contributing factors that non-traditional health related functions play in the overall health of the individual. Although there is a little knowledge of this program, as it covers {{a very small percentage of}} the eligible individuals, and it may be difficult to extrapolate to other sectors of the population, PACE <b>offers</b> <b>many</b> <b>lessons</b> that could be applied to more effective integration of care for individuals and lead to better health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Rockingham County v. The Luten Bridge Company is now {{a staple}} in most Contracts casebooks. The popular story goes as follows: Rockingham County entered into a {{contract}} with the Luten Bridge Company to build a bridge over the Dan River. Shortly after work commenced, the County repudiated the contract. Nonetheless, the Luten Bridge Company continued with its construction project and sued the County for the entire bill. Judge John J. Parker, the long-time chief judge of the Fourth Circuit, ruled in the famous 1929 opinion that the County was liable only for the costs up until the time of breach plus the anticipated profit, a sum of approximately $ 1, 900, and not for the entire bill that was closer $ 18, 000. The case is used to illustrate the “duty to mitigate,” where a party to a contract against whom a breach has occurred is obligated to mitigate the damages resulting from that breach In this article, we revisit the history of this famous case. Examining original sources related to the case, the contemporary history, and the lives of those involved, we reveal that the case arose during, and sharply illustrates, Rockingham County’s struggle to industrialize. The dispute emerged within a heated tax revolt that pitted the county’s farmers against its mill owners and constituted a microcosm of the larger political conflict – endemic throughout North Carolina and the south – over investing in the public improvements necessary to promote industrialization. The Fourth Circuit opinion that transpired from the dispute <b>offers</b> <b>many</b> <b>lessons</b> and insights into the era’s history, its legal issues challenges, and the development of the common law. We do our best to bring the rich story to life and to understand its lessons. Section I of the paper documents the case’s current importance in contract law, and Section II describes in detail the political and legal fights that culminated in Judge Parker’s 1929 opinion. Section III then examines the true contemporary significance of the opinion. We reveal that Judge Parker’s real objective was to enable North Carolina counties to enter into enforceable contracts to enable municipal development and facilitate industrialization, and that the ruling on mitigating damages was merely an afterthought. Section IV then examines the process through which the opinion, despite Judge Parker’s intents, lost its original significance but later became immortalized to establish the mitigation principle...|$|R

Having access to evidence on how education policies can be made to work better is critical evidence for a host of government actors. The Ministry of Education in Peru strongly believes in using evidence for informing its policies. A range of different programmes address barriers and constraints to school participation and learning faced by children and households. These programmes typically aim to address the constraints that children face due to poor health and malnutrition, by providing material incentives for schooling for children and/or parents or by reducing the cost of schooling. Some programmes are designed to address multiple barriers to education, such as school-feeding, which aim to both improve nutrition and reduce the cost of schooling. The results, based on evidence from 107 studies, show that programmes that address child and household constraints to children’s education may be particularly effective at improving participation outcomes. Cash transfers are most effective in improving school participation, while merit-based scholarships have been more successful in improving learning outcomes. School-feeding is a promising intervention for improving both school participation and test scores. Despite being widely implemented, the effects of providing information to children and/or parents, reducing user fees and school-based health programmes are not clear because few studies have been conducted...|$|R
