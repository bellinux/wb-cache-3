Wade if that issue were to come up before the court. Some pro-life activists, however, claim Alito's confirmation as a victory for their cause.|$|E

In a forum held prior to the nomination, Means dismissed the greater funds raised by Paul's campaign, commenting that Means was receiving [...] "10 times more press" [...] than the former Congressman and was therefore [...] "100 times more effective".|$|E

500|$|The fourth track, [...] "Electric", is an {{electronic}} funk song with elements of reggae music. The title track holds a [...] "convinced relativism", according to Robert Christgau, while [...] "Main Thing", {{a cover of}} Shot's 1986 single, explores deep house, disco and funk genres. The ninth track, [...] "Giving You Back", is a piano ballad that addresses Robyn's abortion as she sings [...] "I'm giving you back to {{where you came from}} but I'm not forgetting who you are".

500|$|My Truth was {{released}} in Sweden on 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Around this time, RCA Records, Robyn's international label, were formulating the marketing plans for the album in the United States; the initial reports anticipated the release of an airplay single in September 1999, followed by the album in January 2000. Due to the inclusion of two songs that reflected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>abortion</b> incident, RCA asked Robyn to re-record portions of the album for the American market and pop radio. On top of this, American music magazine Billboard published an article in June 1999 that falsely claimed she had a miscarriage rather than an abortion. Ultimately, Robyn refused to alter the record and a compromise was not reached. The negotiations {{came to an end}} after six months and the plans to release My Truth abroad were cancelled. Robyn's manager Alex Strehl said, [...] "I guess Robyn had moved in a direction that [...] didn't expect." [...] According to Robyn, the label wanted an album like Robyn Is Here and thus were not interested in investing in My Truth. In 2001, she parted ways with RCA and entered a new record deal with Jive Records and Zomba.|$|E

The article's author, Ely Van de Warkle, claimed this procedure was affordable even to a maid, as a man in town offered it for $10 on an installment plan. Other prices which 19th-century abortion providers are reported to have charged were much more steep.
