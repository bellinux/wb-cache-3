5|$|The {{original}} flag code of India did {{not allow}} private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction {{on the use of}} the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.|$|E

5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

25|$|Lord Curzon arrived Dhaka in 1904 and {{established}} Curzon Hall. In July 1905 {{he decided to}} take effect the Partition of Bengal.

Joseph Bampfylde Fuller entered <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> in Dhaka as the first lieutenant-governor of the region in January 1906. But the partition was revoked in 1911 and Dhaka became a district town on 1 April 1912.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{was also}} part of the {{analysis}} employed in Shahar v. Bowers, an Eleventh Circuit case brought against Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers by a woman to whom he had withdrawn a job offer after learning of her plans for a lesbian wedding in 1991, saying it would reflect badly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> in public opinion to have an employee whose lifestyle involved regularly violating Georgia law against sodomy. After Northern District of Georgia senior judge Richard Cameron Freeman granted Bowers summary judgement on her First and Fourteenth Amendment claims, she appealed. A three-judge panel agreed her right to intimate association had been violated and remanded to have that claim considered under a strict scrutiny standard.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 Wilson became Director of Military Operations at the British War Office. As DMO Wilson {{headed a}} staff of 33, divided into five sections: MO1 was “Strategic & Colonial”, MO2 “European, MO3 “Asiatic”, {{and the others were}} “Geographic” and “Miscellaneous”. He was {{initially}} impressed only by the mapping section (and one of his first acts was to have a huge map of the Franco–German frontier hung <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> wall). He soon restructured the sections into MO1 (responsible for the forces of the Crown, including those in India; the Territorial Army was deemed part of Home Defence and answered to the Director of Military Training), MO2 (France and Russia) and MO3 (the Triple Alliance).|$|E

50|$|The Great Saxon Revolt was a {{civil war}} between 1077 and 1088 early {{in the history of}} the Holy Roman Empire led by a group of {{opportunistic}} German princes who elected as their figurehead the duke of Swabia and anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfeld, a two-way brother-in-law of the young Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor (Henry was crowned at the age of six and took <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> when aged sixteen).

25|$|Pepys {{had taken}} to {{sleeping}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> floor; on Wednesday, 5 September, he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. She {{told him that the}} fire had almost reached All Hallows-by-the-Tower and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold – about £2,350 – to Woolwich. In the following days, Pepys witnessed looting, disorder, and disruption. On 7 September, he went to Paul's Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul's Cathedral, of his old school, of his father's house, and of the house in which he had had his stone removed. Despite all this destruction, Pepys's house, office, and diary were saved.|$|E
25|$|The king {{not only}} took a leading part in ritual, but ritual {{is likely to}} have focused <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> as well. The {{erection}} of stelae showing the king and dedicated to the day 'King' (Ahaw), which concluded intervals of five 360-day years, constituted a royal ritual by itself. It appears to implicate the king as the divine lord of his own day. Inversely, at San Bartolo, the divine hero of the day 'King', Hunahpu, substitutes for the real king. Setting up a stela may additionally have involved the notion of the king as a protective 'tree of life'. Moreover, in the Classic period, the king is commonly depicted holding a cosmic serpent from whose jaws deities (often those of rain, lightning and fire) emerge; the king's raising and balancing of this serpent, accompanied by his 'conjuring' of the emerging deities, may well have been expressed and supported by ritual.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted {{examples}} of negligence cited {{by himself and}} other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because {{of the effect of}} the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell {{off the side of the}} building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.|$|E

25|$|An immemorial {{custom of}} the Curia demands that all its {{officials}} shall be duly sworn in, {{and this was}} the case with the vicars. In all probability during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries such oaths were taken at the hands of the pope himself. Later the duty fell to the Apostolic Camera. The oath, whose text (though very much older) first appears in a document of 21 May 1427, greatly resembles, in its first part, the usual episcopal oath; while the latter part applies to the office in question. The oath is conceived in very general terms and lays but slight stress on the special duties of the vicar. The official named on 18 October 1412, as representative of the vicar was also sworn in, and before entering <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> was admonished to take, in presence of a specified cardinal, the usual oath of fidelity to the pope and of a faithful exercise of the office.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{decided to}} run for United States Senator from Arizona in 1986, when {{longtime}} American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater retired. [...] No Republican would oppose McCain in the primary, and according to his press secretary Torie Clarke, McCain's political strength convinced his most formidable possible Democratic opponent, Governor Bruce Babbitt, not to run for the seat. [...] Instead McCain faced a weaker opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, a young politician with an offbeat personality who slept <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> floor and whom McCain's allies in the Arizona press characterized as having [...] "terminal weirdness." [...] McCain's associations with Duke Tully, who by now had been disgraced for having concocted a fictitious military record, as well as revelations of father-in-law Jim Hensley's past brushes with the law, became campaign issues.|$|E

500|$|Clements {{authorized}} significant {{road building}} projects. During his administration, the state funded or built 3,800 miles of rural roads and 4,000 miles of primary roads. Further, he initiated {{construction of the}} Kentucky Turnpike and the Western Kentucky Parkway. The state also assumed maintenance of 6,000 miles of county roads under Clements. During Clements' tenure, only Texas spent more money on developing its roads. Besides improving the roadways themselves, Clements replaced the Kentucky Highway Patrol, which had become a corrupt vehicle of political patronage, with the Kentucky State Police. Clements also used some of the revenue generated from his tax increases to raise the salaries of the state's public school teachers. He approved a 15% increase in funding to the Minimum Foundation Program which provided funding for poor school districts. [...] This was not enough, however, to stave off a 1950 protest march <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> by teachers demanding that he raise another $10million for education. Clements' lieutenant governor and successor, Lawrence Wetherby, was able to meet this demand in 1951 by using increased tax revenue resulting from the Korean War.|$|E
