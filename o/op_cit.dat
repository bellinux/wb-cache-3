25|$|The {{meaning of}} the word is not {{confined}} to male prostitutes. According to Malick (<b>op</b> <b>cit),</b> when malakos is employed in reference to sexual relationships of men with men, it is not a technical term for male call-boys in a pederastic setting. The term may mean effeminate with respect to boys or men who take the role of a woman in homosexual relationships. Nor is the {{meaning of the}} word confined to sexually exploited males.|$|E

500|$|According to Ohlin (<b>op.</b> <b>cit.,</b> p.222), one cannot say [...] "that {{the rate}} of {{interest}} equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does not do that. How, then, is {{the height of the}} interest rate determined. The answer is that {{the rate of}} interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system – through its ability to give credit – can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{has been}} {{described}} by Hilborn as [...] "the most important biblical reference for the homosexuality debate". It is also the only known specific reference in the Bible to female homosexuality. Hilborn (<b>op</b> <b>cit)</b> argues that in the wider passage (Romans 1:18-32) Paul writes that the [...] "global scope of salvation history has been made manifest not only in 'the gospel of God's Son' (cf. v.9), but also in the very 'creation of the world' (v.20)." [...] In common with many traditional commentators, Hilborn (<b>op</b> <b>cit)</b> goes on to argue that condemnation of homosexual activity is derived from the [...] "broad contours" [...] of Paul's argument, in addition to the selective reading of individual words or phrases.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Pasquale D’Elia, sinologist at the University of Rome [...] {{certified}} {{the authenticity}} of the Chinese maps in this museum’s possession, (see <b>op.</b> <b>cit.)</b> stating that [...] "it is the third edition of a geographical and cartographical work that made Ricci famous throughout China.

2500|$|Years of {{conflict}} had left 50,000 casualties and $12 billion of damages {{in a society}} of 3.5 million people and an annual GNP of $2 billion. After the war, a survey was taken of voters: 75.6% agreed that if the Sandinistas had won, the war would never have ended. 91.8% of those {{who voted for the}} UNO agreed with this (William I Robinson, <b>op</b> <b>cit).</b> The Library of Congress Country Studies on Nicaragua states: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, Bourbaki, on p.76 in Chapitre II of Theorie des Ensembles (theory of sets), gave a {{definition}} of a function as a triple f = (F, A, B). [...] Here F is a functional graph, meaning a set of pairs where no two pairs have the same first member. [...] On p.77 (<b>op.</b> <b>cit.)</b> Bourbaki states (literal translation): [...] "Often we shall use, {{in the remainder of}} this Treatise, the word function instead of functional graph." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of obvious import were {{steps taken}} to {{preserve}} the best programming the network had, and make improvements; these were happening in the period immediately prior to, and following, {{the sale of the}} network. [...] While the Blue Network did lose a few programs to NBC, such as Quiz Kids and Duffy's Tavern (more shows that debuted or had a previous run on the Blue; see Lackmann, <b>op.</b> <b>cit.)</b> and the NBC Symphony Orchestra (Lackmann, <b>op.</b> <b>cit.),</b> it did retain one highly rated show, the Jergen's Journal with Walter Winchell, which managed to compete successfully with NBC's powerhouse Sunday night lineup (it was the 11th-ranked program for all of 1943–1944, and Blue's only program in the top 20). [...] The Blue Network also retained the rights to broadcast the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts; Milton Cross was the host for NBC, Blue, ABC, CBS, and the opera's own broadcasts from 1931 through 1975. [...] This was {{in spite of the fact}} that NBC did not want to assign the rights to either the Town Meeting of the Air or the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts to the Blue Network.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{approach}} is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: [...] "overt" [...] and [...] "hidden". Thus any impossible assertion was, in fact, intended as a parable; further, where aggadot can be understood literally, they may be taken on this level. This is, in general, {{the view of the}} Rabbis. [...] "It is proper…to carefully analyse …when any of these seem far-fetched we must immerse ourselves in the various branches of knowledge until we understand the concepts." [...] (Maimonides, <b>op</b> <b>cit.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Lexical {{evidence}} from Greek texts indicates {{the word was}} {{used to refer to}} the passive partner in a male homosexual act. For example, Malick (<b>op</b> <b>cit)</b> writes that a significant expression of this usage is found in a letter from Demophon, a wealthy Egyptian, to Ptolemaeus, a police official, concerning needed provisions for a coming festival. According to Ukleja, [...] "a strong possible translation of both malakos (and arsenokoitēs) is the morally loose (effeminate) who allow themselves to be used homosexually and the person who is a practicing homosexual." [...] Ukleja cites a number of classical Greek sources in support his assertion.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{youthful}} foray into divisionism, Metzinger turned briefly to a robust, Gauguinesque manner in rendering the figure, using strong outlines and flat areas of color. Then, in 1910, he {{became involved in}} the early development of Cubism, a decision that shaped his mature style. Burgess in his article did not hide a preference for Metzinger's paintings of 1907-1909: [...] "Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of pigment not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair" [...] (<b>op.</b> <b>cit.).</b>|$|E
