40|$|For several decades, Fair Trade Social Enterprises (FTSEs) {{have set}} up {{partnerships}} with producer groups in the South and distributed the latter’s products through different types of channels in the North. However, while pioneers {{in the early years}} were relatively homogeneous (nonprofit organizations relying on voluntary work and selling through “worldshops”), organizational diversity has tremendously increased in recent times, including other types of legal forms, architectures, and governance models (volunteer-based, manager-based, multi-stakeholder, etc.). As a result, different categories of FTSEs now coexist in the sector with diverse missions and strategies. Since Fair Trade (FT) is a hybrid concept, entailing economic, social and political dimensions, the diversity of organizational models might reflect or enable different ways of articulating these dimensions. In other words, different organizational models might be suited for different ways of conceiving and practicing FT. Such an articulation through specific forms has been suggested by previous concepts that can be related to FT, such as cooperatives, the social economy, the solidarity economy, and, more recently, social enterprise. The latter is particularly useful as an umbrella concept that embraces the diverse types of FTSEs and accounts for their use of market mechanisms to pursue social innovation. This research first aims to explore and to structure FTSEs’ organizational diversity. For that purpose, the managers of 57 FTSEs were interviewed in four European regions: Belgium, France (Rhône-Alpes), the United Kingdom (England) and Italy (Rome). Based on the combinations of different elements of the organizational form, five categories emerge: individual FTSEs; entrepreneurial, business-form FTSEs; volunteer-based FTSEs; multi-stakeholder cooperative FTSEs; and group structures. Although certain FTSEs share features corresponding to several models, these categories seem adequate in the sense are relatively homogeneous and distinct from each other. The second question examines the factors or forces that lead FTSEs to adopt particular and diverse organizational forms. Using sociological and economic “new institutional” approaches, this book explores the influence of a number of factors on the organizational form: age, size, region, goals, activities, resources, and leaders’ profiles. From an economic standpoint, organizational diversity may be {{explained by the fact that}} FTSEs do not all produce the same types of goods when practicing FT. Thus, FTSEs will adopt the organizational form that minimizes their transaction costs in the production of particular goods. From a sociological standpoint, the analysis suggests that weak and sometimes conflicting institutional pressures explain <b>organizational</b> diversity. Indeed, <b>uniformity</b> is limited (within certain generations of FTSEs or in particular regions), although there is a dominant trend toward a stronger business orientation in the models. The third question examines how organizational actors within FTSEs experience and foster hybridity at the field level, thereby contributing to organizational diversification. Looking at six cases of FTSEs covering the different types of models, the strategic role of FTSEs is examined, as “institutional entrepreneurs” capable of influencing the environment in a way that legitimizes their own organizational model and secures their access to crucial resources. This strategic analysis allows for a more dynamic view of organizational models as “institutional bricolage”. Finally, the book ends with a number of recommendations for FT entrepreneurs on the strengths and the weaknesses of each organizational model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{irrigation}} management among Balinese migrant settlers in Sulawesi, Indonesia. As {{settlers in the}} command area of a state-built irrigation system, they {{have become part of}} its blueprinted managerial structure. However, many settlers derived their experience from subak, the Balinese irrigators' institution. This paper explores the technical, organizational and normative complexity hidden behind claims of order, manageability and control of a ¿modern¿ irrigation system, examining three issues that illustrate the tension between order and disjuncture. First, it criticizes conceptualizations of local management as cycles of degradation by farmer neglect and rehabilitation by government attention. Second, it traces the local history of irrigation development by putting into perspective the assumption of normative, technical and <b>organizational</b> <b>uniformity</b> on which the management structure is based. Third, differences are discussed between engineering approaches to management and Balinese conceptualizations of management, and their consequences for management practice...|$|E

On other rivers there are no comissioners; problems and disputes must be settled on a case by case basis by the state engineer.

A more unifed distribution organization composed of state-employed water sommissioners would have several advantages over the existing system of commissioners employed by local water users. Advantages would include the development and retantion of a higher level of expertise, improved record keeping and reporting, more complete geographical coverage of river systems, and better balance of commissioner work loads. These advantages would come at a higher cost, but the impact on water users could be mitigated by dividing the cost of the system between the users and the general public in a dual financing arrangement...|$|E
40|$|In {{this book}} I present three {{case studies of}} the complex {{regulation}} of use of land and water resources in Luwu. Attention {{to the role of}} legal complexity   - the existence of different sources and definitions of normative-legal regulation in the same socio-political space -   is an important conceptual point of departure of this study. Each of the three case study sections contains specific conclusions pertaining to the issues involved. The last chapter of the book (chapter 11) is primarily a reflection on the wider meaning of the forms of complexity analyzed in the case studies for processes of regulation of resource use. In an epilogue I pay attention to the complex character of broader socio-political processes in Luwu District.   The state-led development of irrigation systems {{is an important factor in}} the economic and societal changes in Luwu since the colonial period. The basis of these rapid and radical changes was laid by the Dutch colonial government in the thirties of last century. Two spearheads of colonial development policy in the framework of the 'Ethical Policy' were emigration (from densely populated Java to the thinly populated ' Outer Islands ' of the colonial empire) and irrigation. In North Luwu, both were combined in programmes for colonization (resettlement of Javanese farmers on islands outside Java) and development of large irrigation systems based on civil engineering approaches. These colonial development plans for Luwu were suddenly interrupted by the turbulent social and political developments in the region: the Japanese occupation, the return of the colonial power after Japanese capitulation, decolonization and the Darul Islam (DI/TII) rebellion from the early fifties until 1965. In that same year the Suharto regime came to power. After 'peace and order' had been restored in an extremely violent way, large financial donors like the World Bank supported the regime by allocating large sums of development funding. ' Pembangunan ' (development) became a keyword in the political ideology of Suharto's 'New Order'. From the late sixties, the old colonial development agenda was revived. In Luwu, this led to an approach combining what was now called 'transmigration' (resettlement of farmer families from Java, Bali and Lombok) with the large-scale development of irrigation systems and other infrastructure. These interventions have radically changed Luwu, and not only in a negative sense. Irrigated agriculture and improved infrastructure have considerably increased the standard of living and food security of the local population of Luwu as well as of migrants. At the same time, transmigration and regional migration have turned Luwu into an, in many respects, very complex society in which tensions and conflicts between the local population and migrants along lines of ethnic and religious affiliation regularly lead to violence. Because of the ethnic diversity it harbours, Luwu is often called a ' Taman Mini' (Miniature Garden), in analogy with the exhibition of the material culture of the 'recognized' ethnic groups in the archipelago established by the Suharto family. Luwu society is not only complex in a legal sense but also in a socio-cultural, political-administrative sense, as I will show in the three case studies. This high degree of complexity of Luwu society also plays an important role in issues concerning the use of natural resources. The first case study (see chapter 3) is an analysis of the regional history of migration of farmers from highland South Sulawesi to lowland Luwu. This massive migration in the second half of the twentieth century has had a great impact on current land tenure in North Luwu. The availability of land resources in Luwu was a strong pull factor for highland migrants in search of agricultural land. The massive and uncontrolled character of this migration and settlement in North Luwu made these processes politically very sensitive. Differences in ethnic and religious identity between migrants and local population are, moreover, a continuous source of tension and violent conflict. A deeper explanation of the political and social sensitivity of this migration can be found in the ways in which migration is related to wider processes of socio-economic, cultural and political-administrative change in the region. In my analysis of migration I pay special attention to the emergence and growing role of a specific ' Toraja ' identity among the highland population. I pose the question whether there is a relationship between the emergence of new identities and identifications in the area and migration to lowland Luwu. This Toraja identity is primarily a product of Dutch colonial and missionary politics. Both in colonial administration and mission there existed the wish to unite the various population groups in highland South and Central Sulawesi administratively into 'Greater Toraja '. This administrative unit was intended to unite all Christianized highland groups into a 'buffer' against Islam, which had been established in lowland Sulawesi many centuries ago and was seen as a threat. Indonesian independence did not bring these political ambitions to an end. In the fifties they even played an important role in regional politics. Its most important manifestations were attempts to establish 'Greater Toraja ' (called ' Toraja Raya ') as an administrative unit at the level of a province, the struggle for autonomy of the southern highlands as ' Tana Toraja District' from the languishing Luwu kingdom, and a lowland-oriented expansionism referred to as 'Lebensraum' by former Toraja politicians. In the latter, the high potential of lowland Luwu in terms of (irrigable) agricultural land played an important role. Massive migration to the Luwu Plain was not only seen as a solution to the social problems in the densely populated and socio-politically hierarchic highlands but also as part of a political strategy oriented towards Luwu. The first ideal died in the political realities in the region in the course of the fifties. The second ideal was realized by the actual establishment of Tana Toraja District in the fifties. The expansionism oriented towards lowland Luwu manifested itself in a rapidly increasing migration to North Luwu and exploitation of land in this area. I conclude that there was indeed a relation between the emergence of Toraja identity and migration strategies to gain access to land resources in lowland Luwu. The second case study (see chapters 4 to 6) is an analysis of the long-term effects of intervention in land rights in the framework of the Pompengan Integrated Area Development Project (PIADP). PIADP, a bilateral Indonesian-Dutch project for rural development, was propagated as a model for integrated rural development in Indonesia. The project had started in 1980 as the Pompengan Implementation Project (PIP), an irrigation project that focused on construction and paid little attention to the social aspects of development. Under the influence of the problems that arose during implementation, of changing views of 'development' and of increasing attention to the social dimensions of processes of planned change PIP changed into the 'integrated' PIADP. The core of PIADP was intervention in land tenure through a programme for redistribution of land and resettlement of farmers. Notwithstanding this shift towards other core activities the project basically remained an irrigation project. Problems of land use, land rights and population density were primarily seen as a threat to local management of the future irrigation infrastructure, and land reform and farmer settlement as a solution to these problems. However, the new approach also meant a shift from a technical intervention to a much more radical, complex and socially sensitive socio-legal type of intervention. PIADP was characterized by new, social objectives originating from Dutch development policy, like creating an egalitarian structure of landownership and greater security of tenure. Thus, a growing awareness of the complexities in implementing PIP had led to even much more complex solutions to the problems, tied to ever more ambitious objectives. To reach these objectives, a 'project law' was created on the basis of Dutch donor norms and priorities as well as sections of the Indonesian 1960 Basic Agrarian Law. Existing claims to land in the project area (that is: local rights built up in the past but not by definition recognized and usually not titled by the government) were inventoried and weighed in a selection procedure for PIADP. The claim holders whose claims were recognized by the project, became 'beneficiaries' of PIADP, and qualified for land and other project facilities. The central research questions for this part of the research are: which definition of land rights has 'won', the local one based on labour invested in and boundaries created by land clearing, or the (re) definition of land rights on the basis of PIADP project law? What was the impact of the land reform programme on land use and land rights? How do various actors cope with the situation of legal complexity? How are conflicts solved and by whom? What is the role of legal institutions? Chapter 4 contains a description of the local context of PIP and PIADP and an analysis of the emergence of new developmental ambitions and objectives for PIADP. In chapter 5 I present an analysis of the implementation of the programme of land redistribution and settlement in PIADP, mainly based on my own experiences as an adviser of the land reform and settlement programme. In chapter 6 I analyze the long-term effects of this programme on security of tenure in the former project area. The analysis shows, among others, that claimants and former 'beneficiaries' of the programme have massively returned to the pre-project claim boundaries. The definition of land rights based on pre-project claims to land prove to be much stronger and to give more security of tenure than land rights defined and recognized by the government in the framework of PIADP. Further, the analysis makes clear that the government has completely withdrawn from the problems of former PIADP. Formal state-issues land titles have no value for those who hold them. Hence, coping with the continuing tensions and conflicts caused by PIADP requires a high degree of self-regulating capacity of the actors involved in the local conflicts in various ways. The third case study is an analysis of the role of land and water resources in Kertoraharjo, a village of Balinese transmigrants in the Kalaena area in North Luwu (see chapters 7 to 10). Chapter 7 describes the history of settlement in the area and development of a relatively prosperous migrant society. Specifically Balinese arrangements in the fields of religion and village administration, social security and local irrigation management exist side by side with the blueprints of government administration. The diversity of areas of origin of the Balinese transmigrants and the different traditional norms and values (Ind. adat) introduced by these groups made the process of unification a difficult one. Chapter 8 focuses on the role of land in Kertoraharjo. I analyze the differences in access to land for three status categories of   migrants : the initial transmigrants, their offspring and spontaneous migrants. In addition, I analyze the growing importance of cocoa cultivation next to (and sometimes instead of) irrigated agriculture since the late eighties. In an analysis of the historical development of landownership I show how Balinese landownership has spread from Kertoraharjo across an increasingly large area stretching out across the provincial border. The growing interest in cocoa cultivation has crucially contributed to this trend. Expansion of Balinese control over land took place wholly outside the sphere of state regulation of land tenure and recognition through titling. Finally, I pay attention to the role of some forms of access to irrigated land that play an important role in strategies of   economic advancement of, especially, the offspring of initial transmigrants and spontaneous migrants: sharecropping and pawning of land. Together, chapters 9 and 10 form an analysis of local irrigation management in the tertiary units of the Kalaena irrigation system in which Balinese farmers own land. The technical and <b>organizational</b> <b>uniformity</b> of state-built irrigation systems in Luwu hides a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity of the various migrant groups. What does this field of tension between standardized arrangements for local management and local diversity mean in the case of Balinese in Kalaena system? The Balinese transmigrants brought their own traditions, knowledge and practices of local irrigation management associated with the so-called subak, an age-old Balinese institution for irrigated rice agriculture in the broadest sense of the term (that is: subak does not only refer to operational and maintenance tasks but includes irrigation technical and managerial, agronomic and religious-ritual dimensions of rice agriculture). This part of the research focused on the history of local irrigation management among Balinese in the tension field formed by technology, norms and rules, and organizational arrangements based on engineering conceptions of irrigation management in the tertiary units on the one hand, and on the subak tradition on the other. The most important research questions were: what is the role of subak and water users' associations in tertiary irrigation management among Balinese farmers? How are both related in the dimensions of technology, normative regulation and organizational arrangements? To what degree and in what way have both changed, influenced or merged in new 'hybrid' forms of local irrigation management? What is the influence of different definitions and conceptualizations of 'irrigation management' in both approaches? This part of the research shows that, deeply influencing each other, subak and the complex of water users' association and tertiary unit have developed in a location-specific manner. As a formal organization, subak has become relatively marginal under the influence of the statutory introduction of the water users' associations related to the tertiary structure of the irrigation system. However, as an institution (that is: as regularized patterns of behaviour) subak continues to play a crucial role. Technical, normative and organizational elements of subak have emerged in the world of local irrigation management formally defined by tertiary units and water users' associations. Thus, both subak and WUA have become 'hybrid worlds'. The last chapter (chapter 11) concludes the book with a reflection on the complex society that Luwu has become and its meaning for issues of resource management. The existence of a high degree of social, legal, ethno-religious and political-administrative complexity and its impact on forms of regulation, as clearly present and visible in the three case studies of this book, make approaches to regulation of natural resource use based on instrumental views of law coupled to mechanistic views of processes of development quite prospectless. In an epilogue I finally point to the broader socio-political dimensions of Luwu District itself as a complex society in times of rapid and radical socio-political change...|$|E
