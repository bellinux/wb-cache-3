An {{observational}} {{study was conducted}} in an oil palm plantation in Tanjung Sepat, Selangor, Malaysia on August until September 2007 to note the decomposition process of pigs and their related faunal succession. We collected six species of ants (Formicidae) from 3 subfamilies: Formicinae (Oecophylla smaragdina and Anoplolepis gracilipes), Myrmicinae (Tetramorium sp. and Pheidologeton sp.) and Ponerinae (Odontoponera sp. and Diacamma sp.) that were associated with pig carcasses placed on the ground. Oecophylla smaragdina, Pheidologeton sp. and Tetramorium sp. were found on a partially <b>burnt</b> <b>pig</b> carcass whereas the other species were recovered from unburned pig carcass. These ants predated on fly eggs, larvae, pupae and adults. Ants could be found at all stages of decomposition starting from fresh until dry stage. Predatory ants can reduce fly population and thus may affect the rate of carcass decomposition but this was not seen in our study. Even though O. smaragdina was seen at all stages of decomposition of the <b>burnt</b> <b>pig,</b> this did not alter much the decomposition process by fly larvae.

40|$|Aim To use {{forensic}} entomological {{approach to}} estimate the post mortem interval (PMI) in burnt remains. Methods Two experiments were performed in a field in the outskirts of Milan, in winter and summer 2007. Four 60 - kg pigs were used: two for each experiment. One <b>pig</b> carcass was <b>burnt</b> until it reached the level 2 - 3 of the Glassman- Crow scale and the not-burnt carcass {{was used as a}} control. In order to describe the decomposition process and to collect the data useful for minimum PMI estimation, macroscopic, histological, and entomological analyses were performed. Results In the winter part of the experiment, the first insect activity on the burnt carcass began in the third week (Calliphora vomitoria) and {{at the beginning of the}} fourth week an increase in the number of species was observed. In the summer part, adult flies and first instar maggots (Phormia regina) appeared a few minutes/hours after the carcass exposure. Both in winter and summer, flies belonging to the first colonization wave (Calliphoridae) appeared on <b>burnt</b> and control <b>pigs</b> at the same time, whereas other species (Diptera and Coleoptera) appeared earlier on <b>burnt</b> <b>pigs.</b> Conclusion In forensic practice, burnt bodies are among the most neglected fields of entomological research, since they are supposed to be an inadequate substratum for insect colonization. Entomological approach for PMI estimation proved to be useful, although further studies on larger samples are needed...|$|R
5000|$|Nea Kameni {{is a small}} {{uninhabited}} Greek {{island of}} volcanic origin located in the Aegean Sea within the flooded Santorini caldera. Nea Kameni and the neighbouring small island Palea (or Palia) Kameni (the new and <b>old</b> <b>burnt</b> islands) have formed {{over the past two}} millennia by repeated eruptions of dacite lava and ash. The Roman historian Cassius Dio records in the year 47 AD [...] "This year a small islet, hitherto unknown, made an appearance close to the island of Thera." [...] Major eruptions over the past 300 years took place in 1707-1712, 1866-1870, 1925-1928, and 1939-1941. The last small eruption happened in 1950 and involved lava dome extrusion.|$|R

50|$|Before 1984 Mount Buller was {{serviced}} by two lift companies {{that involved the}} skier needing to purchase two lift tickets to ski the whole mountain. In 1985, the two lift companies merged, allowing skiers to ski the whole mountain with one ticket. Today, Mount Buller is {{serviced by}} 22 lifts covering {{a wide range of}} terrain. In 1993, with an increasing number of visitors, the ski resort built a new quad chairlift called Wombat Lift on the skiers right of Little Buller spur to relieve the traffic on Federation triple chairlift. 2005 saw the addition of the Emirates quad chairlift to the lift network. A new six-seater chairlift was installed over the 2007/08 summer and is operational for 2008. This addition saw the decommissioning of one of the oldest chairs of the mountain — the Abom (previously known as Helicopter), along with Blue Bullet 2. In 2012 a new quad chairlift was built {{in the area of the}} <b>old</b> <b>Burnt</b> Hut T-Bar. A new carpet was also built.

5000|$|In 2015, it was {{announced}} that a human body farm would open in Sydney, Australia. However, due to ethical backlash from the community, the facility has struggled to get on its feet with human cadavers. Although over 300 people have volunteered to donate their bodies to this cause, as of October 2016, there were only 19 human bodies being studied at the facility. Along with other research to further forensic understanding, these bodies are used to help train cadaver dogs to help police find human remains. Pig remains are used by several other facilities in Australia. They have <b>burnt</b> some <b>pig</b> carcasses to develop a better understanding in how to use fire detection dogs when human remains are involved in a case of arson.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{evaluation}} of changes in the percentage profile of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 25 + T lymphocytes, and their predictive value with respect to the course of experimental skin burns and early necrectomy in pigs. Thirty Large White Landrace pigs of both genders, weighing 50 kg (± 2 kg), were used. Burns to their skin were performed {{with the use of a}} computer-controlled heating plate, applied to the animal’s body and heated to 2000 °C, using 2. 5 kg pressure for 10 s. It produced a burn of 30 % (± 2 %) of body surface with a range of damage between II b° and III°. In animals of each experimental group fascial necrectomy was performed, according to the testing module. Blood from experimental and non-treated control animals was collected from the external jugular vein before the beginning of the experiment (hour 0) and at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, and 180 h of the experiment. An immune response profile was evaluated using flow cytometry analysis of the level and expression dynamics of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 25 + particles on the surface of T lymphocytes. The study demonstrated that experimentally-induced burns in pigs caused cell-mediated immune response reflected in the changes in the percentage of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 25 + T lymphocytes, and that early necrectomy in <b>burnt</b> <b>pigs</b> acted in a protective manner for the organism, based on the immunological index values. The study also proved that the dynamics of cell-mediated immunological response intensification determined on the basis of the percentage of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 25 + T lymphocytes is conditioned by the size of the burnt surface and the time of necrectomy procedure...|$|R
