25|$|The war deeply {{affected}} the local population.

Various theories exist on the origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>racial</b> pogrom against the ethnic-Chinese.

25|$|A {{legal battle}} between archaeologists and the Umatilla tribe over {{the remains of}} a skeleton, nicknamed Kennewick Man, was {{reported}} by 60 Minutes on October 25, 1998, to which the Umatilla tribe reacted negatively. The tribe considered the segment heavily biased in favor of the scientists, cutting out important arguments, such as explanations of Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The report focused heavily on the racial politics of the controversy and also added inflammatory arguments, such as questioning the legitimacy of Native American sovereignty – much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>racial</b> focus of the segment was later reported to have been either unfounded and/or misinterpreted.|$|E
25|$|The French {{writer and}} {{traveler}} Alexis de Tocqueville, in Democracy in America (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing {{its effects on}} American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the south, were bringing the white and black populations {{to a state of}} equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>racial</b> differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.|$|E

25|$|After Reconstruction through 1900, St. Louis {{saw little}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>racial</b> {{violence}} that engulfed Southern states, {{due to the}} stability and relatively small size of the St. Louis black community. Most black residents lived in the northern edges of downtown along the riverfront or {{in the area of}} Chestnut Valley and Mill Creek Valley, near the wharf and railroads for employment. Municipal segregation laws (known as Jim Crow laws) were relatively inconsistent; while blacks could not enter white hotels, restaurants or barber shops, they could enter department store elevators with whites or attend St. Louis theater shows in separate sections. Streetcar seating also was integrated, and there were no efforts to enforce residential segregation prior to 1911.|$|E
25|$|Hispanics {{remain the}} {{dominant}} ethnic {{group in the}} city, and their {{percentage of the population}} has increased from 82.3% in the 2000 Census to 84.7% in the 2010 Census.

The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>racial</b> makeup of the city was 0.70% Native American, 2.15% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 28.19% from other races, and 6.87% from two or more races.

25|$|Discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>racial</b> {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
