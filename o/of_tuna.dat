5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools <b>of</b> <b>tuna,</b> and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E

Whitetips follow schools <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E

However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E

5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time for color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for color fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
40|$|The Spanish Institute of Oceanography {{has been}} {{carrying}} out diverse research projects since 1997 on stock structure and on migration patterns <b>of</b> bluefin <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus), {{using the method}} of electronic tagging of adults. The results are provided to the stock assessment process of this species that the ICCAT Scientific Committee conducts periodically. The tagging is carried out in traps and fattening cages, observing marked differences in the movements <b>of</b> <b>tunas</b> that were tagged in the water from those that were brought on board for tagging. In the latter case, differences were also observed in the behavior <b>of</b> <b>tunas</b> that were released outside the codend of the trap from those that were released together {{with the rest of}} the shoal that was in the trap.

Findings from the study are: (1) Local difference of the length frequency distributions <b>of</b> <b>tunas.</b> The yellowfin tuna and the albacore, proceed to go southward, this group of the larger mode was dominant, but the bigeye tuna. the tendency was quite opposite. The folk length <b>of</b> the yellowfin <b>tuna</b> seemed to become smaller gradually toward the east. (2) Seasonal changes of the length frequency distributions <b>of</b> <b>tunas.</b> In regard to the tuna, the modal size of the principal catch became smaller in accordance with the seasons progress. Especially, in the yellowfin tuna and the bigeye tuna, this phenomenon acoording to my observation and the albacore was not so remarkable. Therefore, the catcher <b>of</b> the yellowfin <b>tuna</b> and <b>of</b> the bigeye <b>tuna</b> are generally composed of the middle size of fish. But, on the contrary, the seasonal change <b>of</b> the bigeye <b>tuna</b> in the South Equatorial Pacific Ocean was not distinct. The seasonal changes of the size compositions of the southern bluefin tuna had not been variable. That <b>of</b> the yellowfin <b>tuna</b> was supposed to be caused by growth of small fish-less than 100 cm in length-and migration of the modal size principal catch to low latitude area. (3) In regard to the tuna, as I reported before, the difference in size of male and female was quite evident and this tendency was also the same in this area.

5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools <b>of</b> <b>tuna,</b> a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{continued}} to conduct marine research after 1934, {{but he felt}} that he had seen what he wanted to see using the Bathysphere, and that further dives were too expensive for whatever knowledge he gained from them to be worth the cost. With the help of Beebe's friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents <b>of</b> <b>tuna,</b> which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish. Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the Zaca. The goal of this expedition was to study the area's undersea fauna by means of dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there. In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the Zaca, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem. Beebe described his two expeditions on board the Zaca in his books Zaca Venture and The Book of Bays, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.|$|E
