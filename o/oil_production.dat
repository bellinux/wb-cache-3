5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{used for}} {{a large number of}} {{small-scale}} applications, such as leather processing, purification of common salt, household cleaning, and building construction. <b>Oil</b> <b>production</b> may be stimulated by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|Initially, <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> was {{conducted}} by many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in <b>oil</b> <b>production.</b> The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E

5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. <b>oil</b> <b>production.</b> As North Slope <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. <b>oil</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in Texan government resulted from the creation of a state <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> tax in 1905. The revenue generated by the tax made funds available for development in the state without the need for income taxes and similar revenue mechanisms adopted in other states. In 1919, tax revenue from <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> surpassed $1 million ($ in today's terms) and in 1929 it reached $6 million ($ in today's terms). By 1940, {{the oil and gas industry}} accounted for approximately half of all taxes paid in the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska {{receives}} royalties from <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> on state land. The state also has a property tax on <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

5|$|After {{the storm}} was named, {{officials}} in Texas began making preparations for Don. The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston issued a level one alert for Don, and city officials began preparing for a possible evacuation. On July 27, oil companies throughout the western Gulf of Mexico began removing non-essential personnel from their rigs and platforms in preparation for Don. The next day, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko and Apache announced the evacuations {{of some of the}} oil facilities in the area, while Exxon-Mobil began preparing the Baytown Refinery for a possible storm strike. Several oil companies stopped <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> as a result of Don; by midday on July 28, 6.8% of <b>oil</b> <b>production</b> and 2.8% of natural gas production in the Gulf had been shut in ahead of the storm.|$|E

In 1924, Pujut Road was built to link Miri with Lutong. By 1925, rotary drilling was introduced. <b>Oil</b> <b>production</b> continued to increase until it reached a peak of 15,211 barrels per day in 1929.

5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased <b>oil</b> <b>production,</b> even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. <b>Oil</b> <b>production</b> became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E

40|$|The Lunnan Low Uplift {{area in the}} Tarim Basin has {{undergone}} several phases of hydrocarbon generation, accumulation and migration. Despite much work, oil source and charge history remain quite controversial. We attempt to understand the charge history through geochemical analyses on four palaeo-oils trapped in fluid inclusions (FI) and five <b>production</b> <b>oils</b> from the Ordovician and Triassic reservoirs. Both FI and <b>production</b> <b>oils</b> contain abundant n-alkanes with low to medium carbon numbers, consistent with results from Quantitative Grain Fluorescence (QGF) and Total Scanning Fluorescence (TSF). However, the biomarker signatures of the Ordovician FI oils are significantly different from Triassic FI oils with higher abundances of C 19 tricyclic and C 24 tetracyclic terpanes, the C 27 hopane Ts, C 29 Ts and the tetracyclic polyprenoids Ta and Tb, and lesser amounts of 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetramethylbenzene, and 2, 3, 6 methyl-substituted arylisoprenoids. Aromatic and aliphatic parameters indicate an early to mid oil window thermal maturity level for all FI oils. The source-specific signature of the <b>production</b> <b>oils</b> indicates a higher maturity than the FI oils and appears to more closely resemble the Triassic FI oils than to the Ordovician FI <b>oils.</b> <b>Production</b> <b>oils</b> from Triassic reservoirs are slightly more mature than Ordovician oils. The presence of C 29 25 - norhopane is largely restricted to the <b>production</b> <b>oils</b> and to Triassic FI oils, indicating that a phase of biodegradation post-dated the trapping of FI oils in Ordovician reservoirs. The <b>production</b> <b>oils</b> in the Ordovician and Triassic reservoirs are probably a mixture of biodegraded oils from an early charging episode, and more mature oils from later charging episodes...|$|R
