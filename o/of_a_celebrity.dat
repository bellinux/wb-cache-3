25|$|There is no general {{right to}} privacy in English law. Attempts to {{establish}} such a right in Kaye v Robertson and Wainwright v Home Office were rejected {{on the basis that}} it could only be done by Parliament. The creation of a tort of infringement of privacy had been recommended by Sir David Calcutt in his Review of Press Self-Regulation published in 1993, but no action was taken. Instead, a patchwork of different torts combine to protect certain aspects of privacy, such as breach of confidence and misuse of private information. In Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd, the House of Lords confirmed that a person will be subject to a duty of confidence if they receive information in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and where there is no justification for interference with that {{right to privacy}}.

25|$|Stack {{analyzed}} {{the results from}} 42 studies and found that those measuring the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>celebrity</b> suicide story were 14.3 {{times more likely to}} find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the death of Kurt Cobain never materialized in an actual increase in suicides. Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors. Similarly the researcher Gerard Sullivan has critiqued research on copycat suicides, suggesting that data analyses have been selective and misleading, and that the evidence for copycat suicides are much less consistent than suggested by some researchers.|$|E
