5|$|In the fallout, Bo {{was removed}} {{as the party}} chief of Chongqing and lost his seat on the Politburo. Bo's {{dismissal}} exposed disunity within Communist Party ranks shortly before a major leadership transition, and some observers suspected {{that it was because}} he threatened Xi Jinping's future grip on power. He was later stripped <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> positions, lost his seat at the National People's Congress, and was eventually expelled from the party.|$|E

5|$|Paulucci reorganised the Kingdom's infantry, {{increasing}} the number of the troops, modifying the brigade system and facing both enthusiastic approval and bitter critic, especially from the heir to the throne, Prince Carlo Alberto.

5|$|The Tripurarahasya, a south Indian Shakta text, retells the story, {{giving more}} {{importance}} to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears {{that he may be}} burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his seed spills, indicating a loss of the merit gained through <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> austerities.|$|E

5|$|While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to {{what exactly}} he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, {{including}} graphic depictions of child molestation, and cruelty, and most <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least {{paint a picture of}} how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.|$|E

5|$|During the race, Alessandro Petacchi tested {{positive}} for elevated levels of salbutamol at a doping control on 23 May, after winning Stage 11. Petacchi has a medical exemption to use salbutamol {{in the treatment of}} asthma, but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level. Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him, the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> results from the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{considered}} {{the painting to}} be his best work, insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 Royal Society of Arts solo exhibition. The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing {{to allow it to}} be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> paintings had fallen below their original prices. As it was rarely exhibited, The Sirens and Ulysses had little influence on later artists, although it is credited as an influence on Frederic Leighton's 1858 The Fisherman and the Syren.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E

5|$|In about 700, Wilfrid appealed {{once more}} to Pope Sergius I over his {{expulsion}} from York, and the pope referred the issue back to a council in England. In 702 King Aldfrith held a council at Austerfield that upheld Wilfrid's expulsion, and once more Wilfrid travelled to Rome {{to appeal to the}} pope. The Vita Sancti Wilfrithi gives a speech, supposedly delivered by Wilfrid there, in defence of Wilfrid's record over the previous 40years. The council was presided over by Berhtwald, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and the decision of the council was that Wilfrid should be deprived <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> monasteries but Ripon, and that he should cease to perform episcopal functions. When Wilfrid continued his appeal to the papacy, his opponents had him and his supporters excommunicated.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> inventions—eighty in total, as alluded {{to in the}} title of his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Etty {{declined}} {{after his}} death as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the cost <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> paintings had fallen below their original prices. Very few subsequent artists have been influenced by Etty, and one of the few later works on which Candaules can be considered an influence is The Knight Errant, painted by John Everett Millais in 1870, which in its depiction of a rape victim, distraught and with her face turned away from the viewer, was a return to the style developed by Etty in Candaules of forcing the viewer to feel complicity in witnessing the sexual degradation of a woman, and which drew similar criticism.|$|E
