In the 2015-2016 STAAR results, 79% of students in Klein ISD were {{at or above the}} Level II Satisfactory Standard, compared to 74% in surrounding Region 4, and 74% in the State of Texas. The Class of 2015 had an SAT average of 1498 and an average 22.7 ACT score, both higher than the Region 4 and State averages. Additionally In 2016, Klein ISD had 13 high school seniors named as Semifinalists in the National Merit Scholarship Program.|$|E
5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers in creative writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. <b>On</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests,</b> SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is a fundamental}} tool in a child's education. Today, most educational opportunities are tied to one's performance <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> that are often multiple choice in nature. When a student contemplates the possible answers available, they use convergent thinking to weigh alternatives within a construct. This allows one to find a single best solution that is measurable.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, a {{quasi-experimental}} {{study was}} conducted that included homeschooled and traditional public students {{between the ages of}} 5 & 10 and it was discovered {{that the majority of the}} homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared to their counterparts (Chang, Gould, & Meuse, 2001). However, Martin-Chang also found that unschooling children ages 5–10 scored significantly below traditionally educated children, while academically oriented homeschooled children scored from one half grade level above to 4.5 grade levels above traditionally schooled children <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> (n=37 home schooled children matched with children from the same socioeconomic and educational background).|$|E

Thirty-one percent of the accepted students in 2016 had perfect GPAs of 4.0 and 41 percent scored in the 99 percentile <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests.</b> There were also 211 National Merit Scholar winners in the enrolled class.

Recruits are screened not only for their ability to perform the tasks assigned, but for their attitude in performing them —such as how they take hardships and unexpected difficulties, how well they work in groups and how they approach problem solving and disaster management situations. As many as 50% percent of those who commence the gibush will be dropped from further consideration at its conclusion.|$|E

25|$|IQ {{scores are}} used for {{educational}} placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants. Even when students improve their scores <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests,</b> they do not always improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention and speed. In research contexts they have been studied as predictors of job performance, and income. They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy (TIZA) was an {{elementary}} school (K-8) in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota named after Tarek ibn Ziyad, the Berber general of medieval Algeria who entered Gibraltar in 711 CE {{on behalf of the}} Umayyad Caliphate and defeated the Visigoths. The school is sponsored by Islamic Relief USA. The school has a primarily Muslim student body and has been embroiled in a number of controversies regarding {{the separation of church and}} state. The school has a waiting list of 1,500 students. Around 80% of students are English language learners. Despite this, the school has one of the highest reading scores <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> in the state. As of July 2011 TiZA has been shut down by order of the Minnesota Education Department, due to lack of an approved charter school sponsor.|$|E
25|$|Most Waldorf-inspired {{schools in}} the United States are {{elementary}} schools established as either magnet or charter schools. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> {{in order to continue}} receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below their peers in the earliest grades and catch up or surpass their peers by middle school. One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television and spend more time engaging in creative activities or spending time with friends. Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded instructional time for academic subjects.|$|E

25|$|The Native American {{language}} education {{movement has}} been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better <b>on</b> <b>standardized</b> <b>tests</b> than their counterparts educated only in English. Some educators have remarked that students who know their native languages {{feel a sense of}} pride and identity validation. Since 1989, Diné College, a Navajo tribal community college, has offered an associate degree in the subject of Navajo. This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses; includes about 600 students per semester; and produces the highest number of Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States. One major university that teaches classes in the Navajo language is Arizona State University. In 1992, Young and Morgan published another major work on Navajo: Analytical Lexicon of Navajo, with the assistance of Sally Midgette (Navajo). This work is organized by root, the basis of Athabaskan languages.|$|E
