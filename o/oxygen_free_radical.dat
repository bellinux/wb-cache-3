Then, the serum <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> indexes and free amino acids {{of the two groups}} were respectively detected and compared, and the detection results of patients in the observation group with different etiologic types and basal metabolic rate were also compared.

Methods: Human blood was circulated through SECC during 3 hours. Control group C was ventilated with oxygen/air mixture and the study group with oxygen/air mixture and NO. Leukocyte activation was measured as serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL), lactoferrin (LF), interleukin- 1 -beta (IL- 1 β) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10). <b>Oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> production capacity was evaluated with chemiluminescence.

The haemodynamic parameters in dogs with MI showed that these dogs had left ventricular failure. The peak chemiluminescent activity of PMN in blood of dogs with left ventricular failure was approximately four times that in the blood from normal dogs. This increase in chemiluminescence reflects an increase in the generation of <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> from PMN in dogs with chronic heart failure.

40|$|BackgroundSphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S- 1 -P) is a {{bioactive}} sphingolipid that {{stimulates the}} migration of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) through G-protein coupled receptors; {{it has been shown}} to activate reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NAD[P]H) oxidase. The role of phospholipase C (PLC) in <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation, and the regulation of VSMC migration in response to S- 1 -P, are poorly understood. MethodsRat arterial VSMC were cultured in vitro. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation was measured by fluorescent redox indicator assays in response to S- 1 -P (0. 1 μM) in the presence and absence of the active PLC inhibitor (U 73122; U 7, 10 nM) or its inactive analog U 73343 (InactiveU 7, 10 nM). Activation of PLC was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting for the phosphorylated isozymes (β and γ). Small interfering (si) RNA to the G-proteins Gαi, Gαq, and Gα 12 / 13 was used to downregulate specific proteins. Statistics were by one-way analysis of variance (n = 6). ResultsS- 1 -P induced time-dependent activation of PLC-β and PLC-γ; PLC-β but not PLC-γ activation was blocked by U 7 but not by InactiveU 7. PLC-β activation was Gαi-independent (not blocked by pertussis toxin, a Gαi inhibitor, or Gαi 2 and Gαi 3 siRNA) and Gαq-independent (not blocked by glycoprotein [GP] 2 A, a Gαq inhibitor, or Gαq siRNA). PLC-β activation and cell migration was blocked by siRNA to Gα 12 / 13. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation induced by S- 1 -P, as measured by dihydroethidium staining, was significantly inhibited by U 7 but not by InactiveU 7. Inhibition of oxygen free radicals with the inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium resulted in decreased cell migration to S- 1 -P. VSMC mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and VSMC migration in response to S- 1 -P was inhibited by PLC- inhibition. ConclusionS- 1 -P induces <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation through a Gα 12 / 13, PLC-β-mediated mechanism that facilitates VSMC migration. To our knowledge, this is the first description of PLC-mediated <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation as a mediator of S- 1 -P VSMC migration and illustrates the need for the definition of cell signaling to allow targeted strategies in molecular therapeutics for restenosis. Clinical RelevanceActivation of vascular smooth muscle cells by growth factors leads to cell proliferation and migration, which are integral features of the healing response in a vessel that leads to the development of intimal hyperplasia after bypass grafting, angioplasty, and stenting. Sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S- 1 -P) is a common phospholipid, released from activated platelets at sites of vessel injury. It is a G-protein–coupled receptor agonist that induces smooth muscle cell migration, a key event in the development of intimal hyperplasia. Mechanisms of cell migration are not well defined, and understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction is important in defining potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The present study shows that S- 1 -P induces <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation through a Gα 12 / 13, PLC-β–mediated mechanism that facilitates smooth muscle cell migration. Targeting choke points in cell signaling, such as membrane G-proteins, is an attractive molecular target in developing therapeutic strategies to moderate restenosis...|$|E

All subjects underwent <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and exhaled nitric oxide measurement (by the diacron reactive oxygen metabolites test and by a rapid-response chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer), lung function tests, and cognitive impairment scales (Mini Mental State Examination and Geriatric Depression Scale).

In the presence of a superoxide anion radical-generating system (2 mM xanthine plus 0. 03 U/ml xanthine oxidase), sarcolemmal Ca 2 +-stimulated ATPase activity and ATP-dependent Ca 2 + accumulation were inhibited in an incubating time-dependent manner. Both lipid peroxidation (r= 0. 82) and sulthydryl group content (r= 0. 95) showed significant correlations with Ca 2 +-stimulated ATPase activity. ATP-indenpendent Ca 2 + bindings were increased upon treating the membranes with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase. Voltage-dependent Ca 2 +-channels were also affected by <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals.</b> The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for [3 H]-nitrendipine binding was depressed without any changes in dissociation constant (Kd). The effects of <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> on adrenergic receptors were more complex.

40|$|AbstractIrreversible {{conversion}} of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) to its <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> producing oxidase (XO) form occurs through an uncharacterized proteolytic process, which was studied in human liver. Upon incubation of fresh unfrozen liver cytosol, XDH remained intact. When recombinant human XDH was coincubated with subcellular fractions of human liver, the mitochondrial intermembrane space {{was shown to}} contain a heat-labile activity that converted XDH irreversibly to XO. This activity is resistant to inhibitors of all major groups of proteases. We postulate that this novel type of proteolytic enzyme is released into the cytosol upon mitochondrial damage...|$|E
40|$|There is {{abundant}} evidence that oxygen derived free radicals {{play an important}} role in acut inflammation. Neutrophils are the most abundant white cells and in mammals provide a first lin of defense against microbial infection. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effec of adrenomedullin (AM) on the oxidative respiratory burst and aggregation of isolated huma polymorphoneuclear leukocyte (PMNLs). <b>Oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> production of isolated PMNL stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and oxygen free radicals O 2 -, H 2 O 2, OH- we...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{factor is}} a transmembrane protein that {{activates}} the extrinsic coagulation pathway by binding factor VII. Endothelial cells, being {{in contact with}} circulating blood, do not normally express tissue factor. Here we provide evidence that <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> induce tissue factor messenger RNA transcription and expression of tissue factor procoagulant activity in endothelial cells in culture. Isolated, perfused rabbit hearts exposed to exogenous <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> also showed a marked increase in tissue factor activity within the coronary circulation. Furthermore, in ex vivo and in vivo hearts subjected to ischemia and reperfusion, a condition associated with a production of <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in large amounts, a marked increase in tissue factor activity occurred. This phenomenon could be abolished by oxygen radical scavengers. This increase in tissue factor activity during postischemic reperfusion {{was accompanied by a}} significant decrease in coronary flow, suggesting that increase in tissue factor activity with the consequent activation of the coagulation cascade might impair coronary flow during reperfusion and possibly contribute to the occurrence of reperfusion injury...|$|R

Short irradiation of spin-labelled muscle fibres by UV light showed the interaction of probe molecules with <b>oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals.</b> The intensity of the EPR signal from maleimide or isothiocyanate spin labels attached to the essential thiol groups decreased following irradiation. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> affected the rate constant of the transition AM. ADP. Vi→AM. ADP in the ATP hydrolysis cycle. It was found that the essential –SH groups of myosin were involved in the oxidation of sulphydryls by Ce(IV).
