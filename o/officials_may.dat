5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower <b>officials</b> <b>may</b> wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E

25|$|Allegations of {{mismanagement}} at Arlington Cemetery {{were first}} raised in 2008. The widow of a United States Army soldier {{complained that the}} wrong headstone was on her husband's grave. A Pentagon investigation found that two servicemen had been buried in the same grave. Cemetery workers had also buried the cremated remains of a servicemember in a grave which was already in use, but unmarked. The cremation error was discovered in May 2008 and the remains buried in an unused grave.

Doe (2000) it ruled that school <b>officials</b> <b>may</b> not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process {{for the purpose of}} indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty is the cornerstone of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.|$|E

While not attempting to explain their acts, Nance notes it is crucial to comprehend terrorists' thought processes so that law enforcement <b>officials</b> <b>may</b> attempt to anticipate them. The book goes over common tactics used by clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents. Nance notes such organizations are a key component to terror operations, and require additional study. He gives forth an analysis of different types of clandestine cell systems, explaining common methodologies, covert communication methods, and from where they recruit their agents.|$|E

The {{former director of the}} government archives, Simon Chu, expressed concern about preservation of official documents pertaining to the protest movement, and was seeking a proxy to file an injunction on the government.

25|$|The Jackie Presser {{indictment}} scandal was a {{legal and}} political scandal which began on June 1, 1984. The scandal erupted after attorneys with the United States Department of Justice initiated a prosecution of Teamsters President Jackie Presser on various charges, including fraud and labor racketeering, only to cease prosecution once {{it was revealed that}} Presser had been a criminal informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since the early 1970s. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials came under intense political pressure to resume prosecution, while Presser's attorneys claimed that Presser had permission from DOJ to engage in the alleged crimes in order to mislead organized crime figures. It was later revealed that FBI and DOJ <b>officials</b> <b>may</b> not have kept investigators in other federal agencies and Congress fully informed of Presser's role, and that FBI agents may have overstepped their authority in giving Presser permission to commit crimes. The scandal largely ended after Presser's death on July 9, 1988.|$|E
