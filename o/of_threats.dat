Both studies used self-administered questionnaires to measure the severity <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> which might be considered a common way to gauge the individual’s perceived threat. Another explanation for the low rank given to perceived severity <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> has been proposed by Expert 1 as he answered that severity <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> can be considered as a multi-attribute that provide an assessment of the user’s risk perception. Likewise, Expert 4 commented that user expectation <b>of</b> the <b>threats</b> occurrence and their perception of risks associated with using social network are similar and can be combined together.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the connection between aggression and the perception <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> {{in a group of}} children with learning and behavior problems (N = 103). Aggression was assessed by means of the aggressive behavior subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form (TRF), and Youth Self-Report (YSR). Perception <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> was measured by studying children’s reactions to a series of stories depicting ambiguous social situations. Results demonstrated small but signifi-cant correlations between self-reported aggression (as indexed by the YSR) and threat perception abnormalities. That is, high levels of aggression were associated with a high frequency <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> perception, high ratings <b>of</b> <b>threat,</b> high levels <b>of</b> negative feelings and cognitions, and an early detection <b>of</b> <b>threat.</b> Furthermore, no substantial connec-tions emerged between children’s level of aggression as rated by parents (CBCL) and teachers (TRF) and threat perception indices. Finally, regression analyses revealed that in particular YSR social problems was a better predictor <b>of</b> most <b>threat</b> perception ab-normalities than YSR aggressive behavior. Implications of these findings are briefly discussed. KEY WORDS: information processing; perception of threat; aggression; children...|$|R

40|$|Defensive {{reactions}} need to {{be quick}} and appropriate to ensure survival. So, {{it is crucial that}} threats trigger immediate action upon detection, {{even in the absence of}} awareness. Also, the form of such action should be appropriate to the imminence <b>of</b> the <b>threat.</b> Thus, attention should be guided by signals <b>of</b> increasing <b>threat</b> imminence. We examined whether subliminally presented threat stimuli provoke automatic avoidance tendencies and whether threat cues’ distance change and threat potential determine attention allocation. Following fear conditioning, participants performed an approach-avoidance task with subliminally presented conditioned threat and safety stimuli and an attentional bias task with approaching versus distancing signals <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> and safety. Pre-attentive processing <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> cues resulted in approach rather than avoidance tendencies; attention was captured preferentially by signals <b>of</b> increasing <b>threat</b> imminence. The results support the importance <b>of</b> <b>threat</b> imminence and extend findings of previous research on pre-attentive influences on defensive responding. status: publishe...|$|R
