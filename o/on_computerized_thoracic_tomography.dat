Upon observing the carcinoma cells consistent with UC metastasis, systemic chemotherapy was commenced. The patient underwent a metastatectomy based <b>on</b> the <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> scan performed <b>on</b> the 4 th month of treatment, which revealed notable regression. The resected tumor was morphologically similar to cells seen in the transthoracic fine-needle aspiration and was immunohistochemically positive for p 63, uroplakin, thrombomodulin, CK 7 and CK 20 at varying degrees but was negative for TTF- 1.

40|$|Objective: Diabetes mellitus, smoking, dyslipidemia, {{and obesity}} play an {{important}} role in the etiology of erectile dysfunction, particularly in cases with vascular insufficiency. These risk factors also target the lungs due to their systemic effects. Materials and Methods: Patients with penile vascular insufficiency determined at Doppler ultrasonography and undergoing <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> for various reasons were included in this study. A history of acute thoracic trauma, pneumonic consolidation, or pelvic surgery and trauma were regarded as exclusion criteria. Results: Thirty-seven male patients with identified vascular insufficiency (age 54. 48 ± 13. 62 years) were enrolled. Mass lesions with a malignant morphology were present in two patients. The most common mediastinal/vascular pathology was atherosclerosis, while the most common parenchymal lesion was emphysematous aeration. Other findings included parenchymal fibrotic bands, atelectasis, interstitial thickening, bronchiectasis, air trapping, aortic aneurysm, a dilated pulmonary artery, hiatal hernia, and pericardial effusion. Conclusion: Erectile dysfunction may be an early sign of cardiovascular diseases.

40|$|Prognosis of {{advanced}} hepatocellular carcinoma is dismal when locoregional treatments have failed. Systemic chemotherapy is seldom effective in inducing objective response and prolonging survival. We report {{a case of}} complete pathological remission of hepatocellular carcinoma after three cycles of systemic chemotherapy. A 64 -year-old woman presented with histologically documented hepatocellular carcinoma without associated liver disease, relapsed after earlier locoregional therapy. Surgery was not performed as <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) demonstrated pulmonary bilateral nodules. The patient was treated with chemotherapy consisting of three cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5 -fluorouracil (ECF regimen); stable lung disease and a good partial response in the liver were obtained as documented by CT scan. Hepatic segmentectomy was therefore performed and the histologic examination revealed necrosis without evidence of residual disease. Two more cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were infused after surgery. At 1 -year follow-up the patient is alive and free of disease according to a positron emission tomography/CT scan.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the history and}} lung pathology of a premature female infant, who presented with respiratory distress immediately after birth. A <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> scan showed abnormalities suggestive of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the left lung. In addition, echocardiography revealed a tetralogy of Fallot. A left thoracotomy was performed and the lower lobe of the left lung was removed. Despite intensive supportive therapy, pulmonary hypoperfusion resulted in severe hypoxemia and death. Gross and microscopic analysis of the resected lobe revealed a partly cystic and solid lesion with multiple bronchus-derived cysts and an exuberant multifocal proliferation of glandular tissue, resembling bronchial glands, mixed with heterotopic cartilage surrounding ducts. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of chromogranin A-reactive islet-like structures amidst exocrine tissue showing trypsin and chymotrypsin immunoreactivity, establishing the diagnosis of pulmonary pancreatic heterotopy. In the remaining pulmonary parenchyma, there were secondary changes consistent with partial obstruction and lymphangiectasis which was attributed {{to the presence of}} the cardiac malformation.

The objective {{of this study was}} to describe an outbreak of invasive fusariosis in a children's cancer hospital. A neutropenic 17 -year-old male patient hospitalized for 10 days for a relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia, under chemotherapy, presented fever without any other symptoms; a <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. During voriconazole treatment, 1 -cm reddened and painful subcutaneous nodules appeared on arms and legs and the culture of a skin biopsy revealed F.  solani. Another case occurred 11 days later and started an outbreak investigation. Water samples for cultures were collected from taps, showers and water reservoirs. Air from all patient rooms was sampled. Faucets and the drains of sinks and showers were swabbed and cultured. Environmental and clinical isolates were typed. There were 10 confirmed cases of infection caused by Fusarium spp. F.  oxysporum and F.  solani were isolated from water, swabs and air in patient rooms. Many control measures were instituted, but the outbreak was only controlled 1 year after the first case, when water filters filtering 0. 2 μm were installed at the exit of all faucets and showers in all patient rooms (points-of-use). Typing demonstrated that clinical isolates of F.  oxysporum were similar to those of the environment. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first reported outbreak of invasive fusariosis in children with oncohaematologic disease.

40|$|Research {{funded by}} the University of Malta. OBJECTIVES Biomechanical {{modelling}} of the forces acting on a median sternotomy can explain the mechanism of sternotomy dehiscence, leading to improved closure techniques. METHODS Chest wall forces on 40  kPa coughing were measured using a novel finite element analysis (FEA) ellipsoid chest model, based on average measurements of eight adult male <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scans, with Pearson's correlation coefficient {{used to assess the}} anatomical accuracy. Another FEA model was constructed representing the barrel chest of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Six, seven and eight trans-sternal and figure-of-eight closures were tested against both FEA models. RESULTS Comparison between chest wall measurements from CT data and the normal ellipsoid FEA model showed an accurate fit (P < 0. 001, correlation coefficients: coronal r = 0. 998, sagittal r = 0. 991). Coughing caused rotational moments of 92  Nm, pivoting at the suprasternal notch for the normal FEA model, rising to 118  Nm in the COPD model (t-test, P < 0. 001). The threshold for dehiscence was 84  Nm with a six-sternal-wire closure, 107  Nm with seven wires, 127  Nm with eight wires and 71  Nm for three figure-of-eights. CONCLUSIONS The normal rib cage closely fits the ellipsoid FEA model. Lateral chest wall forces were significantly higher in the barrel-shaped chest. Rotational moments generated by forces acting on a six-sternal-wire closure at the suprasternal notch were sufficient to cause lateral distraction pivoting {{at the top of the}} manubrium. The six-sternal-wire closure may be successfully enhanced by the addition of one or two extra wires at the lower end of the sternotomy, depending on chest wall shape. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: Administration of {{tuberculosis}} (TB) vaccines in participants with previous or current pulmonary TB {{may have the}} potential for causing harmful postvaccination immunologic (Koch-type) reactions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and immunogenicity of three dose levels of the AERAS- 402 live, replication-deficient adenovirus 35 -vectored TB candidate vaccine, containing three mycobacterial antigens, in individuals with current or previous pulmonary TB. METHODS: We performed a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded dose-escalation study in an HIV-negative adult South African cohort (n = 72) with active pulmonary TB (on treatment for 1 - 4 mo) or pulmonary TB treated at least 12 months before study entry and considered cured. Safety endpoints included clinical assessment, flow volume curves, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, pulse oximetry, chest radiograph, and high-resolution <b>thoracic</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> scans. Cytokine expression by CD 4 and CD 8 T cells, after stimulation with Ag 85 A, Ag 85 B, and TB 10. 4 peptide pools, was examined by intracellular cytokine staining. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No apparent temporal or dose-related changes in clinical status (specifically acute, Koch phenomenon-like reactions), lung function, or radiology attributable to vaccine were observed. Injection site reactions were mild or moderate. Hematuria (by dipstick only) occurred in 25 (41 %) of 61 AERAS- 402 recipients and 3 (27 %) of 11 placebo recipients, although no gross hematuria was reported. AERAS- 402 induced robust CD 8 + and moderate CD 4 + T-cell responses, mainly to Ag 85 B in both vaccine groups. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the AERAS- 402 candidate TB vaccine to participants with current or previous pulmonary TB induced a robust immune response and is not associated with clinically significant pulmonary complications.
