40|$|Coxiella burnetii is an {{intracellular}} bacterium and the causative {{agent of}} Q fever. The zoonotic impact of Q fever was recently underlined by the Dutch Q fever outbreak, which emerged from an endemic state. In this outbreak dairy goats and dairy sheep were deemed {{responsible for the}} human cases, although information about the genetic background of human and animal isolates was lacking. Also tissue dissemination, excretion pathways and immune responses in C. burnetii-infected goats are still poorly understood. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the epidemiology and pathogenesis of C. burnetii infection in goats in the recent large outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands. The epidemiology of C. burnetii was studied by characterising outbreak isolates from infected goats, sheep and humans using multiple locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) and multispacer sequence typing (MST). In addition, potential presence of the Q fever agent in roe deer, cats, dogs, pigs, horses and cattle was investigated. Pathogenesis, excretion patterns and immune responses were investigated during experimental infections in pregnant goats inoculated with a Dutch outbreak isolate. Genotypic characterisation revealed that one unique genotype of C. burnetii was predominantly present in dairy goat herds representing 60 % of all dairy goat herds with abortion problems, and in two sheep herds in the human Q fever outbreak area {{in the south of}} the Netherlands. This genotype was also present in human outbreak samples. In roe deer, dogs, horses and cattle samples C. burnetii DNA was detected. Genotyping results suggest species-specific genotypes for roe deer and cattle that are unrelated to the Dutch outbreak genotype, although the outbreak genotype was detected in one bovine placenta. In experimental infections, pregnant goats were successfully inoculated via the intranasal route. C. burnetii showed a strong tropism towards the placenta. Bacterial replication seemed to occur predominantly in the trophoblasts of the placenta and not in other organs <b>of</b> <b>goats</b> <b>or</b> <b>kids.</b> High numbers of C. burnetii were excreted during abortion, but also during parturition of liveborn kids. C. burnetii was not detected in faeces or vaginal mucus before parturition. Two weeks post-inoculation a strong anti-C. burnetii Phase 2 IgM and IgG antibody response was observed, succeeded by an anti-Phase 1 response. Four weeks before parturition, the number of IFN-γ producing cells in peripheral blood increased and reached high levels during the first week after parturition. These results confirm dairy goats and sheep as the source of the Dutch Q fever outbreak, while in cattle a specific cluster of C. burnetii genotypes was found, unrelated to the outbreak genotype. C. burnetii has a strong tropism for the trophoblasts of the placenta and is not excreted before parturition; pathogen excretion occurs during birth of dead as well as live, healthy kids. Upon C. burnetii infection a strong phase-specific antibody response is detected. This may be useful in the early detection of C. burnetii-infected pregnant goats. These animals should be considered as a major zoonotic risk via abortions, but also via normal deliverie...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of DNA fragments {{in blood and}} milk from goats fed conventional (control) or Roundup Ready® soybean meal solvent extracted (s. e.; treated) was investigated by using a polymerase chain reaction approach. The same investigation was carried out on blood, skeletal muscle and organs from kids of both groups fed only dams' milk until weaning. Moreover, the possible effects on cell metabolism were evaluated by determination of several specific enzymes in serum, heart, skeletal muscle, liver and kidney. Fragments of the multicopy chloroplast (trnL) gene were found in blood and milk samples from <b>goats</b> <b>of</b> both groups. In kids, the chloroplast fragments were found in samples of both groups. In samples, which proved positive for the {{presence of}} chloroplast DNA, fragments of the specific soybean single copy gene (lectin) were detected in several blood and milk samples. The same fragment was also found in control and treated groups of kids. Transgenic fragments were not found in those samples, which were found positive for chloroplast fragments of control groups <b>of</b> either <b>goats</b> <b>or</b> <b>kids.</b> On the contrary, in blood and milk <b>of</b> treated <b>goats,</b> fragments both <b>of</b> the 35 S promoter and the CP 4 epsps gene were detected. These fragments were also found in treated kids with a significant detection of the 35 S promoter in liver, kidney and blood, and of the CP 4 epsps gene fragment in liver, kidney, heart and muscle. A significant increase in lactic dehydrogenase, mainly concerning the lactic dehydrogenase- 1 isoenzyme was found in heart, skeletal muscle and kidney of treated kids, thus suggesting a change in the local production of the enzyme. Finally, no significant differences were detected concerning kid body and organ weight...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} whether the improved post-weaning intake of Chromonaela odorata by goat kids is related to either the in utero period <b>of</b> the <b>goat</b> <b>kids</b> <b>or</b> the subsequent suckling period. It was hypothesized that kids born to dams fed C. odorata during pregnancy and receiving milk from dams not exposed to C. odorata during pregnancy show an improved acceptance to consume this plant. Twenty female goats were successfully synchronized and divided into 4 groups. Two groups (1 and 3) were offered 50 g of dried C. odorata leave meal (COLM) mixed with a basic diet for the last 3 months of pregnancy until 1 week before parturition. At birth the kids from the goats in group 1 and 2 were cross fostered without colostrum or milk from their own mother. While waiting for the delivery of kid from another goat, the kid was fed milk replacer or milk from any goat dam in the same treatment. Kids from groups 3 and 4 remained with their mothers. After weaning (2. 5 months old), one kid from each goat dam was selected for COLM intake which was measured for 30 min over a 4 week period. Feeding activities of the individually housed goat kids was monitored with a camera system. Kids born to dams receiving COLM during pregnancy consumed higher amounts of the COLM supplemented test feed during all feeding preference tests compared to kids from the control group, particularly during week 3 and 4 (P < 0. 001). Shorter latency, longer time spent on each meal and total eating time, chewing time and higher meal size (P < 0. 05) were different in the kids born from does that ingested COLM during pregnancy. It is concluded that prenatal exposure to C. odorata via maternal ingestion significantly increases the intake of C. odorata by weaned goat kids. This improved intake is due to the in utero learning and not the transfer of (secondary) components via the milk of the mothers fed C. odorata during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Environmental driven {{changes in}} meat goat {{production}} systems in Vietnam {{require the use}} of new feedstuffs in the diets for <b>goats.</b> The introduction <b>of</b> novel feedstuffs to young goats is often associated with a reduced feed intake, daily gain and welfare. The work presented here investigated different learning strategies to increase the preference for flavour cues and ingredients after weaning. It was hypothesized that goat kids may learn flavour preferences from their mother during pregnancy or during lactation and that this learning improves the intake of novel ingredients after weaning. Chromoneala odorata was chosen as a model feedstuff to study neophobia in goats. C. odorata, however, has a strong smell and adult goats are reluctant to consume this plant voluntarily. Therefore, C. odorata was selected as a test feedstuff because it was anticipated that the intake of C. odorata would result in a high contrasts compared to control animals. The first experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that feeding C. odorata to pregnant goat dams increases the acceptance of this plant by their offspring. It was found that kids born from does that were exposed to C. odorata during pregnancy consumed more of this plant. This finding indicated that the kids learned in utero about C. odorata. Due to the experimental design, however, it could not be excluded that the process of adaptation to C. odorata was caused by the consumption of the milk instead of during pregnancy. Therefore, a second experiment was designed to investigate whether the process of adaptation to C. odorata was related to either the in utero period <b>of</b> the <b>goat</b> <b>kids</b> <b>or</b> to the subsequent suckling period. It was hypothesized that kids born to dams fed C. odorata during pregnancy and receiving milk from dams not exposed to C. odorata during pregnancy show an improved acceptance to consume this plant. This experiment corroborated the outcome of the first experiment in that kids learned in utero about C. odorata. An attempt was made to provide a clue about the underlying mechanism to manipulate postnatal feeding behaviour (third experiement). Therefore, the importance of the phase of pregnancy on in utero learning of C. odorata by goats was evaluated by comparing mid with late pregnancy exposure to C. odorata of the pregnant does. It appeared that the transmission of feeding preference from mother to offspring occurred during late gestation and that it remains present at least 3 months after weaning in goats. Finally, the idea was tested whether kids would consume more C. odorata after experiencing the flavour through the mother’s milk (fourth experiment). It was hypothesized that exposure of C. odorata to the dams during both pregnancy and lactation versus pregnancy alone, further increased post-weaning intake of C. odorata by their offspring. However, it appeared that the transmission of feeding behaviour from goat dams to offspring did not occur during lactation. The concept of in utero learning in goats, however, again was confirmed...|$|R
