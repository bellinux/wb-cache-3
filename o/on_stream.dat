25|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gases (or LPGs, {{another name}} for propane and butane) have to be contained well above atmospheric pressure to remain in liquid form. The partners therefore had to build special “breakout” facilities in Superior, Wisconsin, to enable this operation to work. They also had to construct batch receipt facilities, storage, and a fractionation plant at Sarnia. That plant went <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the cost}} of {{developing}} these resources (they tend to be capital intensive), they tend to come <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> later in the cycle of petroleum resource development in a given producing region. This is because oil companies tend to extract the light, high-value oils first. The more difficult-to-extract resources are developed later, generally during periods of high commodity prices, such as the extended period of higher prices which began in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|There {{appears to}} be as much {{confusion}} about smart adherence technology as there is whenever a new technology comes <b>on</b> <b>stream.</b> Overzealous journalists tend to confuse science fiction with reality.

25|$|Aberdeen {{had been}} a major {{maritime}} centre throughout the 19th century, {{when a group of}} local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming <b>on</b> <b>stream,</b> much of the trawling fleet had relocated to Peterhead. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.|$|E
25|$|IOC Barauni in the Bihar {{state of}} India {{was built in}} {{collaboration}} with the Soviet Union at a cost of Rs.49.4 crores and went <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> in July, 1964. The initial capacity of 2 MMTPA was expanded to 3 MMTPA by 1969. The present capacity of this refinery is 6.00 MMTPA. A Catalytic Reformer Unit (CRU) was also added to the refinery in 1997 for production of unleaded motor spirit. Projects are also planned for meeting future fuel quality requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} beaver-related {{flooding}} issues that people encounter {{are caused by}} blocked road culverts or freestanding beaver dams. Beaver-related flooding issues can usually be resolved with properly designed and installed water control devices, also known as flow devices. Flow devices are either specially designed pipes installed through beaver dams, or pipe and/or fence systems that protect road culverts from being blocked. The beneficial effects of beavers <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> flow, riparian habitat, salmon and trout, and wetland creation can be sustained with application of these inexpensive technologies, which require little maintenance.|$|E

Ten projects are expected to achieve successful exploration and heat flows, by 2010, with at least three power generation demonstration projects coming <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> by 2012. A geothermal power plant is generating 80kW of electricity at Birdsville, in southwest Queensland.|$|E
25|$|A further 10-year plan {{followed}} {{in which more}} land was acquired and a new shaft sunk, however, {{it was not until}} spring 1887 that work commenced on this new sinking. The following year the part completed colliery gained the name Birley East Colliery. Although a small amount of coal was being cut from the new colliery, brought to the surface at Birley West, it was not until 1890 when a new winding engine was installed that it fully came <b>on</b> <b>stream.</b> Later expansion came with mining rights being obtained from the Duke of Norfolk to mine below Handsworth Common.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 (the {{same year}} the Great Canadian Oil Sands {{proposal}} went up for approval) Cities Service Athabasca Inc. proposed a 16,000 cubic metre per day plant {{at the site}} of its Mildred Lake pilot project. Including a pipeline to Edmonton, the plant was to cost $56 million, with construction beginning in 1965 and completion in 1968. However, the Oil and Gas Conservation Board had concerns about competition between synthetic oil and conventional oil for limited markets. It therefore decided not to bring too many oil sands plants <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> at once, and rejected the Cities Service proposal in favor of the GCOS project.|$|E

25|$|ESB, Ervia and Airtricity are {{the three}} main {{electricity}} and gas suppliers in Ireland. There are 19.82 billion cubic metres of proven reserves of gas. Natural gas extraction previously occurred at the Kinsale Head until its exhaustion. The Corrib gas field was due to come <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> in 2013/14. In 2012, the Barryroe field was confirmed to have up to 1.6 billion barrels of oil in reserve, with between 160 and 600 million recoverable. That could provide for Ireland's entire energy needs for up to 13 years, when it is developed in 2015/16. There have been significant efforts to increase the use of renewable and sustainable forms of energy in Ireland, particularly in wind power, with 3,000 MegaWatts of wind farms being constructed, some {{for the purpose of}} export. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that 6.5% of Ireland's 2011 energy requirements were produced by renewable sources. The SEAI has also reported an increase in energy efficiency in Ireland with a 28% reduction in carbon emissions per house from 2005 to 2013.|$|E
25|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{efforts in the}} {{education}} sector, other sectors (for example, certain aspects of housing and municipal services) in Egypt are planning to decentralize decision-making and spending, now nationwide (without a pilot stage in limited governorates), in a phased approach. Education plans {{to be one of}} the lead sectors in this process. In addition to administrative and financial decentralization, there is an increasing emphasis on involving elected local popular councils (which exist at governorate and district level) in the horizontal oversight of expenditure and planning across the decentralizing sectors, and as they come <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> in the decentralization process. Within the education sector, as of late 2009 plans are being made to decentralize certain lines of funding and planning for capital equipment and infrastructure, in all governorates, all the way to school level in the case of smaller units of capital equipment, or levels higher than the school for items such as new infrastructure. The education sector does expect to continue to use the original 3 pilot governorates as a special observatory to assess and understand how well the process is proceeding.|$|E
25|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that beavers girdle and fell trees {{and that they}} {{diminish}} riparian trees and vegetation, but the opposite appears to be true when studies are conducted longer-term. In 1987, Beier reported that beavers had caused local extinction of Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) on 4–5% of stream reaches on the lower Truckee River in the Sierra Nevada mountains; however willow (Salix spp.) responded by regrowing vigorously in most reaches. He further speculated that without control of beaver populations, aspen and cottonwood could go extinct on the Truckee River. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization, but {{a recent study of}} ten Sierra Nevada streams in the Lake Tahoe basin using aerial multispectral videography has also shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin herbaceous vegetation are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. These findings are consistent with those of Pollock, who reported that in Bridge Creek, a stream in semiarid eastern Oregon, the width of riparian vegetation <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> banks was increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent to the stream. In a second study of riparian vegetation based on observations of Bridge Creek over a 17-year period, although portions of the study reach were periodically abandoned by beaver following heavy utilization of streamside vegetation, within a few years, dense stands of woody plants of greater diversity occupied a larger portion of the floodplain. Although black cottonwood and thinleaf alder did not generally resprout after beaver cutting, they frequently grew from seeds landing on freshly exposed alluvial deposits subsequent to beaver activity. Therefore, beaver appear to increase riparian vegetation given enough years to aggrade sediments and pond heights sufficiently to create widened, well-watered riparian zones, especially in areas of low summer rainfall.|$|E

500|$|New Melones Dam has a {{very large}} storage {{capacity}} relative to the watershed that feeds it, as compared to other major reservoirs in California. The potential water yield, and thus the supply contracts, of the Melones Project were calculated based <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> flow data between 1922 and 1978; however, this period may have been somewhat wetter than the long-term average. The Bureau of Reclamation estimated the additional water yield per year as [...] but the actual yield has been closer to [...] As a result, the reservoir is often at a low water level because in most years demand is greater than supply. In the 38 years between 1978 and 2016, New Melones has only reached capacity five times, and only once (in 1983) has it reached {{the level of the}} spillway. Between 1987 and 1992 Reclamation was forced to purchase water from other agencies to fulfill New Melones' water obligations. Even so, the reservoir fell to a record low level of , 3.5% of capacity, on October 1, 1992. Conversely, the great storage capacity also means that New Melones can capture more flood runoff while other major California reservoirs must release it to maintain flood control space.|$|E
500|$|His {{transcendental}} signature style {{first came}} into full expression with his 1968 classic, Astral Weeks and he was noted to have remained a [...] "master of his transcendental craft" [...] in 2009 while performing the Astral Weeks songs live. This musical art form was based <b>on</b> <b>stream</b> of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with LA Weekly wrote [...] "he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known." [...] Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison's music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: [...] "But in his music {{the same sense of}} escape from ordinary limits – a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence – can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, the self is left behind, and the sound, that [...] "yarragh," [...] becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body." [...] A book reviewer further described it as [...] "This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life..." ...|$|E
