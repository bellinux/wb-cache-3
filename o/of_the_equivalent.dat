5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E
5|$|The First World War Ottoman Turkish Army was {{modelled}} {{after the}} German Imperial Army, {{with most of}} its members being conscripted for two years (infantry) or three years (artillery); they then served in the reserve for the next twenty-three years. The pre-war army had 208,000 men in thirty-six divisions, formed into army corps and field armies. On mobilisation each division had three infantry and one artillery regiment {{for a total of}} around ten thousand men, or about half the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> British formation. Unlike the largely inexperienced ANZACs, all the Turkish Army commanders, down to company commander level, were very experienced, being veterans of the Italo-Turkish and Balkan Wars.|$|E

The defeat of the Yildirim Army Group, commanded by Otto Liman von Sanders, resulted in the capture of many thousands of prisoners and many miles of territory stretching from the Judean Hills. After the battle of Megiddo, Desert Mounted Corps pursued the retreating German and Ottoman soldiers to Damascus, which was captured six days later, when the pursuit continued on to close to the border of modern-day Turkey. Five weeks after the Final Offensive began and with Aleppo captured, the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire ending the fighting in this theatre.|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had {{the same rights as}} native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E

His score of 313, against Sri Lanka at the National Stadium, Karachi in 2009, is the third highest total by a Pakistan batsman in Test cricket and the twentieth highest overall. Khan has scored Test centuries at 17 cricket grounds, {{including}} 20 at venues outside Pakistan. He scored centuries in both innings of a Test match against Australia in January 2014 becoming seventh Pakistani to achieve the feat. In Test cricket, Khan is the first Pakistani batsman to score centuries against all the Test cricket playing teams. He is most successful against Sri Lanka, making eight Test centuries against them. Khan has made a double century (200 or more runs) on six occasions during Tests while two times got out on 199 and 194 respectively. , he is equal sixth overall among all-time Test century-makers, and top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>equivalent</b> list for Pakistan. In October 2015, Khan became Pakistan's all-time leading run scorer in Test matches, overtaking Javed Miandad's tally of 8,832 runs, while playing against England.
