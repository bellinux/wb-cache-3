5|$|Two days later, Clark was reinstated. With Clark back in {{the lineup}} for a home game against St. Bonaventure Bonnies, Ron Everhart tried a new {{starting}} lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench. The Dukes took a 15point lead at half time, but the Bonnies came back. With less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two. <b>One</b> <b>quick</b> possession by each team left it 67–69 {{in favor of the}} Bonnies. On the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, who hit a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining. Duquesne won 70–69, giving them their first win since December 22.|$|E

50|$|The eight-count figures extend {{across two}} {{measures}} of music, and utilize the rhythm slow (two counts), <b>quick</b> (<b>one</b> count), <b>quick</b> (<b>one</b> count); slow (two counts), <b>quick</b> (<b>one</b> count), <b>quick</b> (<b>one</b> count). Most {{of them can}} be further decomposed into two four-count figures, although this would break the convention that every figure begins in closed position with the man stepping on his left foot. Examples include: the forward and reverse box, the left and right box turns, the closed twinkle with promenade close ending, the fallaway twinkles (16 counts), the promenade twinkels (16 counts), and the serpentine (a/k/a progressive twinkles) with closed footwork. A few, such as the grapevine, utilize a faster rhythm consisting of four quicks. Most of these eight-counter figures resemble corresponding figures in the waltz, with the rhythm modified by extending the first step of each figure to occupy two counts. Again, many of these figures can be further embellished by underarm turns.|$|R

After the merger, AMC had its first profitable quarter during the second three months of 1955, earning $1,592,307, compared {{to a loss of}} $3,848,667 during the same period in the previous year. Mason also entered into informal discussions with James J. Nance of Packard to outline his strategic vision. Interim plans were made for AMC to buy Packard Ultramatic automatic transmissions and Packard V8 engines for certain AMC products.|$|E
500|$|Human {{evolution}} and {{the resilience of}} life may {{also be seen as}} key themes of Gravity. The film opens with the exploration of spacethe climax of human civilizationand ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Dr. Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director Cuarón said, [...] "She’s in these murky waters almost like an amniotic fluid or a primordial soup. In which you see amphibians swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours she’s a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in <b>one,</b> <b>quick</b> shot". Other imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene in which Stone rests in an embryonic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord. Stone's return from space, accompanied by meteorite-like debris, may be seen as a hint that elements essential to the development of life on Earth may have come from outer space in the form of meteorites.|$|E

Mortality in non-overwintering generations is greatly decreased.|$|R

[...] As his {{financial}} situation stabilized, Gosse courted Emily Bowes, a forty-one-year-old member of the Brethren, who was both a strong personality and a gifted writer of evangelical tracts. They were married in November 1848, and their union was an extremely happy one. [...] As D. J. Taylor has written, [...] "the word 'uxorious' seems to have minted to define" [...] Gosse. [...] Gosse's only son was born on 21 September 1849, an event Gosse noted in his diary with the words, [...] "E. delivered of a son. Received green swallow from Jamaica"—an amusing conjunction which Edmund later described as demonstrating only the order of events: the boy had arrived first.|$|E

50|$|Most {{figures are}} based upon four-count units with the rhythm slow (two counts), <b>quick</b> (<b>one</b> count), <b>quick</b> (<b>one</b> count), repeating in each measure. A basic dance {{sequence}} progressing around the room might employ a feather step (four counts), reverse turn with feather finish (eight counts), three step (four counts), natural turn (four counts) with impetus (four count) and feather finish (four count), connecting again to a reverse turn. However, rhythmic variation is used {{to make up for}} the loss of variety in figures and positions: thus, for example, the weave uses four quick steps in a single measure, while the change of direction uses a two-measure sequence of four slow steps.|$|R

Examples include: the basic movement forward and back, the alternating quarter turns (a/k/a zig-zag), the rock turns right and left, the promenade, the promenade twist (12 counts), the promenade pivot (12 counts), and the sway step. Social dancers generally use the alternating quarter turns to progress in a zig-zag pattern around the room, alternating for variety with the promenade. Rock turns are used for changes of direction in corners and to avoid collisions. Both the rock turns and balance step can be danced entirely in place, if necessitated by crowded conditions. Many of these figures can be further embellished by underarm turns.|$|R
