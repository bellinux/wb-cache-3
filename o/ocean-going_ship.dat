5|$|SS Great Britain is {{a museum}} ship and former {{passenger}} steamship, which was advanced for her time. She {{was the longest}} passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller, Great Britain {{was the first to}} combine these features in a large <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ship.</b> She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.|$|E
25|$|Although Andes {{was built}} as an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ship</b> she was {{designed}} for the temperate to tropical sea and weather conditions between the UK and South America, rather than cold North Atlantic winters. Early in 1944 on a westward crossing she suffered weather damage to her forecastle, lifeboats and other fittings. Repairs at New York cost $46,500.|$|E

West Lianga briefly had the distinction of being the fastest-launched and fastest-completed <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ship</b> in the world. Pressed into cargo service for the US Navy, USS West Lianga was commissioned into the [...] and completed four round-trip voyages to France for the Navy. After decommissioning in mid 1919, she was briefly in cargo service out of Seattle before being laid up in late 1921.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{new developments}} in transport volumes, and locations of barge and <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships,</b> {{on the basis of}} data sets, the literature and model simulations. Transport volumes of both barge and <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships,</b> expressed in tonnes, will increase in the next two decades. A shift will occur from bulk goods to containers. Due to a shift to large ships, {{the increase in the number}} of shipping movements will be lower than the increase in shipping volume (tonnage). Changes in the type of goods to be transported will result in further concentration on the main rivers and canals. However, because inland harbours and terminals are expected to become more important, secondary rivers and canals will be used. <b>Ocean-going</b> <b>ships</b> will show an increased shift to sailing in the southern part of the Continental Platform compared to the rest of the Platform. Besides, due to a shift of harbour capacity in Rotterdam in the direction of the North Sea, the number of land-inward movements of <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships</b> will decrease...|$|R
500|$|West Ekonk was {{launched}} for the [...] in June 1918 {{as a part}} of the West ships, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort. At one point West Ekonk had the distinction of being the ninth fastest-built <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ship</b> in the world. Pressed into cargo service for the US Navy, USS West Ekonk was commissioned into the [...] and completed three round-trip voyages to Europe for the Navy. After decommissioning in mid 1919, she was briefly in cargo service out of Baltimore and New York before being laid up in Norfolk, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|He {{designed}} {{his first}} <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ship,</b> the [...] brig Nautilus, in 1868, {{which was built}} at Eureka, {{in an attempt to}} get a faster ship for the Tahiti run. The hull of Nautilus was exactly the reverse of what was customary in the area at that time, being [...] "long and sharp forward, lean and full on the waterline aft." [...] Despite the predictions of sceptics that the ship would dive and pitch into the water, resulting in a very wet ride, Nautilus proved a great success. Turner decided to move into shipbuilding, setting up a yard near Hunter's Point with his brother Horatio. In 1876 he married for a second time, to Captain Rundle's widow, Ashbeline. The success of his first shipyard led him to search for another location, to allow the business to expand. He went into business with his brother and John Eckley, forming the Matthew Turner Shipyard at Benicia in 1883. This yard constructed at least 154 wooden-hulled ships.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{the seventeenth}} nor {{the eighteenth century}} {{witnessed}} any innovations so immediately revolutionary in human conditions as printed paper and the <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ship,</b> {{but there was a}} steady accumulation of knowledge and scientific energy that was to bear its full fruits in the nineteenth century. The exploration and mapping of the world went on. Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand appeared on the map. In Great Britain in the eighteenth century coal coke began to be used for metallurgical purposes, leading to a considerable cheapening of iron and to the possibility of casting and using it in larger pieces than had been possible before, when it had been smelted with wood charcoal. Modern machinery dawned.|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the {{emissions}} of particles and gases from two diesel-powered ships in the southern Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Namibia. The measurements are used to derive emission factors from ships of three species not reported previously, namely, black carbon, accumulation-mode particles, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), as well as for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4), non-methane hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and condensation nuclei. The effects of fuel grade and engine power on ship emissions are discussed. The emission factors are combined with fuel usage data to obtain estimates of global annual emissions of various particles and gases from <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships.</b> Global emissions of black carbon, accumulation- mode particles, and CCN from <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships</b> are estimated to be 19 - 26 Gg yr(sup - 1), (4. 4 - 6. 1) x 10 (exp 26) particles yr(sup - 1), and (1. 0 - 1. 5) x l 0 (exp 26) particles yr(sup - 1), respectively. Black carbon emissions from <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships</b> are approximately 0. 2 % of total anthropogenic emissions. Emissions of NOx and SO 2 from <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships</b> are approximately 10 - 14 % and approximately 3 - 4 %, respectively, of the total emissions of these species from the burning of fossil fuels, and approximately 40 % and approximately 70 %, respectively, of the total emissions of these species from the burning of biomass. Global annual emissions of CO and CH 4 from <b>ocean-going</b> <b>ships</b> are approximately 2 % and approximately 2 - 5 %, respectively, of natural oceanic emissions of these species...|$|R
