40|$|Lifting hooks may be flat-die {{or closed}} die forged or else {{made of a}} series of shaped plates. After forging and {{machining}} operations, hooks are annealed and cleaned from scale. Lifting hooks in crane handling mechanisms are used safely handle and lift the loads during the lifting operation. Appropriate solution of shape and materials of hooks enables the increase of loading capacity <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> <b>machines.</b> The inner diameter of hooks should be sufficient to accommodate two strands of chains or rope which carry the load. More often than not hooks have a trapezoidal section, made wider on the inside. The 3 -D modeling and finite element model of the simple hook is formed by means of computer-aided engineering software and directly analyzed applying finite elements. Stress analysis of lifting hook as a curved beam can be calculated using Bach approach. In order to compare the stress results obtained by exact methods and finite element method, an illustrative example is given...|$|E

Since accurate speed control <b>of</b> the <b>hoisting</b> <b>machine</b> was required, the impracticality of varying the frequency to a high power AC motor meant that the use of an MG set with a DC hoist motor was a near industry-standard solution. Modern AC variable-frequency drives and compatible motors have increasingly supplanted traditional MG-driven elevator installations, since AC drives are typically more efficient by 50% or more than DC-powered machinery.|$|R

50|$|Contrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval {{building}} {{sites were}} neither {{placed on the}} extremely lightweight scaffolding used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight <b>of</b> both <b>hoisting</b> <b>machine</b> and load. Rather, cranes {{were placed in the}} initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults. Thus, the crane 'grew' and 'wandered' with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the surface}} stress {{detection}} system <b>of</b> the mine <b>hoist</b> <b>machine</b> drum, the wireless sensor nodes {{placed on the}} drum need to be powered by a battery. Since the sampling frequency is high and the wireless transmitting and receiving data is enormous, the battery needs to be replaced very frequently. To solve this problem, this paper designed wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvestingx 8 device for wireless sensor node on the drum <b>of</b> mine <b>hoist,</b> which can charge the battery by obtaining the energy from the environment. In this paper, {{the structure of the}} energy harvesting device was introduced, the working principle of wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvesting device on the drum surface <b>of</b> the mine <b>hoist</b> was analyzed, and the piezoelectric bimorph cantilever beam energy harvesting circuit with ultra-low loss characteristics was designed. Based on these, we conducted several experiments with the wind-induced piezoelectric energy harvesting device. The result indicates that the final storage voltage can reach 4. 4 V at both ends of C 3 in the piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit, which means it is able to charge the lithium ion battery.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> load on {{transverse}} vibrations <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> catenaries during lifting in {{coal mines}} {{was investigated in}} this study. Firstly, dynamic analyses <b>of</b> the vertical <b>hoisting</b> rope were performed. The results show that transverse vibration plays the dominating role in the coupled dynamics of the vertical rope subjected to external excitation induced by axial fluctuations of head sheave, and the rope tension can be approximated by the quasistatic tension. Secondly, employing dynamic simulations, the effect <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> load on the transverse vibrations <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> catenaries was discussed. The results show that, under the second-order excitation frequency, a discrepant large transverse amplitude will be excited when the hoisting load ranges from 0 to 5000 [*]kg, leading to collision between the two adjacent catenaries and accelerating the rupture of rope. To solve this problem, according to simulation curves, the self-weight of conveyance (preload) can be optimized from 39500 [*]kg to 49500 [*]kg. Eventually, on-site measurements were performed on the studied machine, validating {{the accuracy of the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> load on transverse vibrations <b>of</b> <b>hoisting</b> catenaries.
