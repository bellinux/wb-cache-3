5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E
5|$|The England {{selectors}} {{surprised the}} cricket public {{with their new}} appointment as captain, selecting a player who many believed owed his appointment more to his father than his <b>own</b> <b>ability.</b> Chris Cowdrey {{was the son of}} Colin Cowdrey, an England captain in the 1960s and later given a knighthood and then life peerage for his services to the sport; Chris Cowdrey was also godson of the chairman of selectors, Peter May. Cowdrey was a successful captain of Kent in county cricket, but had played just five Tests previously, during the 1984–85 tour to India, captained by David Gower. He became only the second son to follow his father as captain of the England cricket team, after George Mann in the 1940s followed Frank Mann in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of Egypt was already well developed before Ibn Tulun's arrival, {{with a number}} of departments (dīwāns) responsible for the collection of the land tax, the supervision of the post, the public granaries (dīwān al-ahrāʿ), the Nile Delta lands (dīwān asfal al-arḍ), and possibly a privy purse (dīwān al-khaṣṣ) for the governor's personal use. A chancery (dīwān al-inshāʾ) possibly also already existed, or else was established under Ibn Tulun, when he remodelled the Egyptian administration after the Abbasid central government. Most of the officials employed by Ibn Tulun were like him trained in the caliphal court at Samarra. Ibn Tulun's chancellor was the capable Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Abd al-Kan (died 891), while other important positions in the administration were held by the four Banu al-Muhajir brothers and Ibn al-Daya. Al-Balawi also reports several anecdotes about Ibn Tulun's extensive use of spies and his <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> to uncover spies sent against him, and claims that the chancery was established so that Ibn Tulun could check up on every piece of correspondence with the caliphal court.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} on {{the perception of}} our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior. Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> or opinions. There is also the facial feedback hypothesis: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is an individual's {{impression}} of their <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> {{to perform a}} demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery. This impression is based upon factors like the individual's prior success in the task or in related tasks, the individual's physiological state, and outside sources of persuasion. Self-efficacy {{is thought to be}} predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change, so although self-efficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach.|$|E
25|$|The narrator {{introduces}} a character he once dreamed about, an Abyssinian maid who sings of another land. She is {{a figure of}} imaginary power within the poem who can inspire within the narrator his <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> to craft poetry. When she sings, {{she is able to}} inspire and mesmerise the poet by describing a false paradise. The woman herself is similar to the way Coleridge describes Lewti in another poem he wrote around the same time Lewti. The connection between Lewti and the Abyssinian maid makes it possible that the maid was intended as a disguised version of Mary Evans, who appears as a love interest since Coleridge's 1794 poem The Sigh. Evans, in the poems, appears as an object of sexual desire and a source of inspiration. She is also similar to the later subject of many of Coleridge's poems, Asra, based on Sara Hutchinson, whom Coleridge wanted but was not his wife and experienced opium induced dreams of being with her.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} quality {{which supports}} right action is Heedfulness (Appamada), {{a combination of}} energy/effort (Viriya) and Mindfulness. Mindfulness is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware {{of what is happening}} with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' (Sampajañña), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is Trust or Confidence in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> to put them into practice. Wisdom and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of not-self for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.|$|E
25|$|Doudna entered Pomona College in Claremont, California {{to study}} biochemistry. During her sophomore year, while taking {{a course in}} general chemistry, she {{questioned}} her <b>own</b> <b>ability</b> {{to pursue a career}} in science, and considered switching her major to French. However, her French teacher suggested her to stick with science. Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch, both professors of chemistry at Pomona, had a major impact on her. She started her first scientific research in the lab of Sharon Panasenko. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry from Pomona College in 1985. She went to Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989. Her Ph.D. thesis was on engineering a self-replicating catalytic RNA and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak. From 1989 to 1991, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School. From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey Postdoctoral Scholar in Biomedical Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she worked with Thomas Cech.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{examines}} {{the relation between the}} fear of being laughed at (gelotophobia) and intellectual abilities (verbal, numeric, and spatial intelligence, memory and reasoning, vocabulary, and attention) and the self-estimation of one's <b>own</b> <b>abilities.</b> In a first study, N = 167 participants completed ability tests along with a subjective measure for gelotophobia. The results indicate that gelotophobia and intellectual abilities exist independently from each other. These results were replicated in a second study (N = 177) with an independently collected data set. In this study the participants also completed a form for the self-estimation of their <b>own</b> <b>abilities.</b> Though there was a tendency for lower self-estimations of their <b>own</b> <b>abilities,</b> the mean scores were not significantly different among groups of non-gelotophobes and participants with borderline, slight, and pronounced fear of being laughed at. However, the differences between psychometrically measured and self-estimated abilities showed that gelotophobes have a lower self-estimation of their abilities regarding general intelligence, vocabulary, and attention. Taken together the studies show that gelotophobia is not related to intelligence but that gelotophobes tend to have lower self-estimations of their <b>own</b> <b>abilities</b> and underestimate their true ability (i. e., psychometrically measured) by 6 IQ-points. The general pattern of low self-estimations of abilities in gelotophobes is discussed and whether this might be a useful starting point for the development of treatments for gelotophobi...|$|R

People with cancer pain who accept that pain will persist and nevertheless are able to engage in a meaningful life were less susceptible to catastrophizing and depression in one study. People with cancer pain who have clear goals, and the motivation and means to achieve those goals, were found in two studies to experience much lower levels of pain, fatigue and depression.|$|E
