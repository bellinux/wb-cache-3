In it he indicted no less than twenty of his fellow-townsmen for treason; and he also thought it wise to send over to Clovelly for Bijah Bixby, a {{lieutenant}} in that section, to come and look over the ground and ascertain by his well-known methods how far the treason had eaten into the body politic. Such was Jake's <b>ordinary</b> <b>procedure</b> when the bombs were fired, for Mr. Wheeler was nothing if not cautious.|$|E
60|$|Now, as it shortly turned out, {{what made}} this {{incident}} of the Rachel's the more melancholy, was the circumstance, {{that not only was}} one of the Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew; but among the number of the other boats' crews, at the same time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father was plunged {{to the bottom of the}} cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief mate's instinctively adopting the <b>ordinary</b> <b>procedure</b> of a whaleship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.|$|E
60|$|One exception, and one only, is {{admitted}} by the statutes to {{the universality of}} this exclusion, viz., a lease for a term not exceeding thirty-one years. But even this privilege is charged with a prior qualification. This remnant of a right is doubly curtailed: 1st, that on such a short lease a rent not less than {{two thirds of the}} full improved yearly value, {{at the time of the}} making it, shall be reserved during the whole continuance of the term; and, 2ndly, it does not extend to the whole kingdom. This lease must also be in possession, and not in reversion. If any lease is made, exceeding either in duration or value, and in the smallest degree, the above limits, the whole interest is forfeited, and vested ipso facto in the first Protestant discoverer or informer. This discoverer, thus invested with the property, is enabled to sue for it as his own right. The courts of law are not alone open to him; he may (and this is the usual method) enter into either of the courts of equity, and call upon the parties, and those whom he suspects to be their trustees, upon oath, and under the penalties of perjury, to discover against themselves the exact nature and value of their estates in every particular, in order to induce their forfeiture on the discovery. In such suits the informer is not liable to those delays which the <b>ordinary</b> <b>procedure</b> of those courts throws into the way of the justest claimant; nor has the Papist the indulgence which he [it?] allows to the most fraudulent defendant, that of plea and demurrer; but the defendant is obliged to answer the whole directly upon oath. The rule of favores ampliandi, &c., is reversed by this act, lest any favor should be shown, or the force and operation of the law in any part of its progress be enervated. All issues to be tried on this act are to be tried by none but known Protestants.|$|E

40|$|Mainly {{approached}} from a sectoral point of view, {{the process of}} administrative convergence {{is first and foremost}} structurally supported by the European procedures governing the European decision-making process. The paper argues that the <b>ordinary</b> legislative <b>procedure</b> itself has acted as a transversal vector of the administrative convergence process both on the formal and informal levels. The <b>ordinary</b> legislative <b>procedure</b> provides very sophisticated tools that contribute throughout the whole cycle of a legislative proposal to the administrative convergence. The impact assessments and the compliance tests with the Charter of Fundamental Rights including the right to a good administration ensures ex ante that the draft legislative proposals meet the basic requirements for a good administrative final act. On an institutional level, the active national experts defending their interests in various structures of the Council of the EU have the possibility to add real national value to each European piece of legislation and thus to play the part of convergence agents. At the same time, the interplay of the European institutions {{within the framework of the}} <b>ordinary</b> legislative <b>procedure,</b> formerly known as the codecision procedure, had triggered sophisticated strategies that also directly contributed to the administrative convergence in the European Union. It is in this realm, on the basis of some concrete examples, through the analysis of some tools provided by the <b>ordinary</b> legislative <b>procedure</b> that the paper shows how the rules underlying the very creation of the EU law have horizontally contributed to the process of European administrative convergence.

For the system call approach, the user process uses the trap instruction. The idea is that the system call should appear to be an <b>ordinary</b> <b>procedure</b> call to the application program; the OS provides a library of user functions with names corresponding to each actual system call. Each of these stub functions contains a trap to the OS function. When the application program calls the stub, it executes the trap instruction, which switches the CPU to kernel mode, and then branches (indirectly through an OS table), to the entry point of the function which is to be invoked. When the function completes, it switches the processor to user mode and then returns control to the user process; thus simulating a normal procedure return.|$|E

Parry added that, since the matter of initial ineligibility was still before the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, he was currently unable to advise that the <b>ordinary</b> <b>procedure</b> for filling a casual vacancy (section 15 of the Constitution) applied and he would provide further advice following the Court's decision, expected [...] "in the near future".

Culleton maintained that this was also a stay of the declaration of bankruptcy, so that he continued to be a Senator. However, he was already listed on the Parliament website as a [...] "former Senator". On 19 January it was reported that Culleton's lawyer had received a letter from Parry's office which warned that, in continuing to identify himself as a Senator, Culleton could be committing the serious offence of impersonating a public official, and that in response Culleton had amended his parliamentary Facebook page to read [...] "Rod Culleton - 'Senator' for WA - Gone Fishin'" [...] and changed the signature on his parliamentary emails to [...] "Rod Culleton | Federal Senator for Western Australia (Gone Fishin')". On 31 January 2017, Justice Gageler in the High Court rejected challenges by Culleton to the Court's jurisdiction and to Parry's decision.|$|E

The RPC technique abstracts a typical communication pattern to an <b>ordinary</b> <b>procedure</b> call.

The experiments performed using an implementation of the method show that the method provides performance that is scalable to the access ratio of the remotely referenced data. 1 Introduction Remote {{procedure call}}s (RPCs) are a key technique for building distributed systems and applications.

One can even speak of a development in which some procedures for provisional measures, like interim injunction procedures: kort geding at the rechtbank (district court) and voorlopige voorzieningen at the kantongerecht (subdistrict court), are increasingly adopting the characteristics of an accelerated procedure; these provisional proceedings are de facto final since they are no longer followed by a procedure on the merits. These interim procedures are frequently used as a placebo for accelerated proceedings.
