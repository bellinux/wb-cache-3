40|$|The 1995 – 96 cereal {{harvest in}} the Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{is the best}} within the last ten years. Provisional {{assessments}} project a regional maize surplus of 2. 08 million tons, a 72 % increase in production over the previous year’s harvest. Overall cereal production substantially increased in all countries except Tanzania, where the current cereal forecast of 3. 73 million tons is a 14 % drop from last year’s output of 4. 34 million tons. Of special note are the exceptionally large increases in the area planted in cereals in war-ravaged Angola and Mozambique, {{for the first time}} in many years. Production trebled in Botswana, doubled in Zimbabwe, and ranged from 21 % in Malawi to 85 % in South Africa. Although all the SADC states harvested a normal to above-normal crop, only Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa have the capacity to export. The other countries need to import grain from these three to augment strategic grain reserves, especially maize. Anticipated <b>opening</b> <b>stocks</b> for the 1996 – 97 marketing year are critically low despite the optimistic cereal supply expectations for the year. Cereal supplies during the period leading to harvest time remained less than satisfactory, particularly in Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, because of inadequate import plans and slow delivery rates...|$|E

I analyze intraday price data on thirty stocks currently making up the Dow Jones Industrial Index. Employing the sample average and the sample median of <b>opening</b> <b>stock</b> returns for each of the trading days within the sample period as two alternative proxies for the general market opening returns, I document that if the previous day's market and individual <b>stock's</b> <b>opening</b> returns are taken together to explain the <b>stock's</b> <b>opening</b> returns, then the effect of the lagged general market opening returns is significantly negative, while the effect of the lagged <b>stock's</b> <b>opening</b> returns is significantly positive. Moreover, following days characterized by both positive and negative market opening returns, a given <b>stock's</b> <b>opening</b> returns tend to be higher if its previous day's opening returns were positive. Such price behavior seems to contradict the concept of market efficiency. Finally, I construct a number of portfolios based on the opening trading sessions and involving a long position in the stocks on the days when, according to the findings, their opening returns are expected to be high and a short position in the stocks on the days when, according to the findings, their opening returns are expected to be low.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, I explore interday {{correlations}} between open-to-close and <b>opening</b> <b>stock</b> returns. Employing intraday price data {{on all the}} stocks that were S&P 500 Index constituents {{during the period from}} 1993 to 2013, I find that <b>stock</b> returns in <b>opening</b> trading sessions systematically tend to be higher following days with relatively low (either negative, or lower than the same day's market) open-to-close returns. Moreover, I explicitly document the tendency of <b>opening</b> <b>stock</b> returns to be reversed (to change their sign) following previous day's open-to-close returns. This kind of price behaviour seems to contradict stock market efficiency, and may be potentially interpreted as stock price ‘corrections’ following their ‘deviations’ from the underlying values caused by noise trading during the continuous trading sessions. Based on this finding, for the sampling period, I construct two different daily-adjusted investment portfolios based on the opening trading sessions and involving a long position in the stocks on the days when their opening returns are expected to be high and a short position in the stocks on the days when their opening returns are expected to be low. Both portfolios are found to yield significantly positive returns, even after accounting for trading commissions, providing an evidence for practical applicability of the documented pattern in <b>opening</b> <b>stock</b> prices.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} stressing the importance of developing financial markets, including stock markets, to enhance countries' growth.

While it is possible that in some instances <b>opening</b> a <b>stock</b> market can lead to increased growth, I do not find any evidence that <b>opening</b> a <b>stock</b> market has any impact. This research uses two Bayesian econometric methods, Extreme Bounds Analysis (EBA) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), to discover if there are meaningful links between stock markets and growth in developing economies.

In some buildings, the internal air velocities above the animals were also recorded. While the monitoring instruments were being set up, a detailed questionnaire was used {{to collect data on}} major housing features and management factors.

40|$|In this thesis, five dynamic Post-Keynesian corn-credit {{models are}} {{constructed}} as testbeds for numerical analysis experiments that generate traverse paths through historical time using computer simulation. The "corn-credit economy" is {{a synthesis of}} theoretical insights gleaned chiefly from the writings of Joan Robinson, Knut Wicksell, Michal Kalecki, John Maynard Keynes, Gunnar Myrdal, and Adolph Lowe. The first Model A has a fixed corn price, money wage and interest rate. Each such constant is replaced by equations to become a variable in Models B, C and D, respectively, e. g. money expenditure directed at a given supply of foodcorn determines its price. The final Model E uses a conventional demand function for the same purpose. Each 31 st December, capitalist-farmers decide the flow of seedcorn invested, then store the balance of that year's harvest as foodcorn. On 1 st January, this lagged seedcorn flow becomes the <b>opening</b> <b>stock</b> of seedcorn, which is sown by workers employed to raise the next crop. Likewise, the lagged foodcorn flow becomes the <b>opening</b> <b>stock</b> of foodcorn available for sale to consumers while the new crop is being tended. The workers' fortnightly money wages, together with all profit and interest incomes, are partly saved but mainly spent on foodcorn released weekly from the granaries. The structural-form equation (common to all models) that determines the volume of seedcorn invested is crucial, since the reduced forms show that investment decisions drive the evolution of all other economic variables. In turn, seedcorn invested is itself driven by a time-series of "profitability gaps" between the realised and required rates of return on capital stock, {{in a process of}} circular and cumulative causation. A constant "reaction coefficient" determines the rate of capital accumulation as a fraction of the profitability gap. Such positive feedback or path dependence is so pronounced in the complex structural form of Model E that no reduced form can be derived. All models are solved numerically for a 100 -year equilibrium stationary state, then a smooth exponential growth path is generated for all but Model E. These stationary and steady states are used as reference time paths or "basecases", from which specimen traverse paths are made to depart by perturbing the model's parameters. A sensitivity matrix is constructed for Model E by initiating numerous convergent traverses connecting its initial with a final stationary state. This matrix shows the long-period effect of a change in each parameter upon every endogenous variable. By tracing "chains of causation" made visible by the matrix, these cause-effect elasticities confirm that Keynes's paradox of thrift and Rowthorn's paradox of costs operate in Model E. The most powerful parameters are the foodcorn demand elasticities, indicating a strong influence of sovereign consumers on the price, profitability and production of corn. Certain key variable-pairs are scatter-plotted to see whether some conventional relationships used for comparative static analysis hold over the range of reaction coefficient values defining a viable corn-credit economy. Instead of the familiar curves, these scatter-plots reveal a sequence of well-defined patterns, resembling the evolution of a spiral galaxy such as our own Milky Way. Due to the observed traverse behaviour of Model E being quite violent, a public sector is added and the modified Model E* is used to discover a policy mix that tames the laisser faire instability of a demographic shift from zero to positive workforce growth. This policy-constrained or "instrumental traverse", as defined by Adolph Lowe, successfully guides the economy onto a tranquil steady-state growth path with near-full employment...|$|R
