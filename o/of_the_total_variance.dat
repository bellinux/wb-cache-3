Based on <b>the</b> highest ratio <b>of</b> Cl−/Na+ (3. 02) and <b>the</b> highest concentration <b>of</b> K (4. 37 μg·m− 3), Ba (0. 37 μg·m− 3), and Sr (0. 07 μg·m− 3) in February 2013, it can be concluded that firework powders have aggravated the haze weather during <b>the</b> Spring Festival <b>of</b> 2013. <b>The</b> micro-equivalent concentrations <b>of</b> cations and anions were calculated and the comparisons between the calculated and measured NH 4 + concentrations were conducted. The results illustrate that aerosol particles in HS are acidic and there may exist some other cationic ions not detected in this study. An obvious positive correlation and good linear regression among WSIIs suggest that the chemical forms in HS aerosols show a great variety of combinations, such as NH 4 NO 3, NH 4 HSO 4, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, NH 4 Cl, KCl, KNO 3, NaCl, NaNO 3, Ca(NO 3) 2, CaSO 4, MgCl 2, Mg(NO 3) 2, and MgSO 4. The WSIIs have large positive correlation and linear regression with the elements, suggesting that WSIIs in mining cities are strongly influenced by element constituents. Principal component analysis implies that WSIIs in PM 10 are probably from three sources.

50|$|Although the Arctic Oscillation is {{responsible}} for more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>variance</b> in mean sea level pressure over the Arctic, the meridional winds anomalies that arise {{as a result of}} the spatial structure of the Arctic dipole anomaly make it the primary driver of Arctic sea ice export variability. During the positive phase of the Arctic dipole anomaly, anomalous winds drive sea ice from the central Arctic out the Fram Strait and into the Greenland Sea via the transpolar drift stream. In contrast, during the negative phase, anomalous winds reduce the removal of sea ice through the Fram Strait. This is supported by Watanabe et al., as well as Wang et al., which show that sea ice export is enhanced during the positive phase of the Arctic dipole anomaly, while export is reduced during the negative phase.|$|E
50|$|Dimensionality {{reduction}} {{may also}} be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy. If each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed Gaussian noise, then the columns of T will also contain similarly identically distributed Gaussian noise (such a distribution is invariant under {{the effects of the}} matrix W, which {{can be thought of as}} a high-dimensional rotation of the co-ordinate axes). However, with more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>variance</b> concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less—the first few components achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio. PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later principal components may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss.|$|E
50|$|While {{the spatial}} {{characteristics}} of the mature Atlantic Niño are quite similar to its Pacific counterpart, its temporal variability is somewhat different. The Atlantic Niño varies on interannual timescales like El Niño, but also shows more variance on seasonal and annual timescales. That is to say, the Atlantic Niño explains a smaller portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>variance</b> in the equatorial Atlantic than does El Niño in the equatorial Pacific. This {{is due to the}} fact that there are seasonal climate events that are superimposed on the interannual variability. The Atlantic Niño typically reaches mature phase in boreal summer (though there are exceptions), while El Niño matures in boreal winter. The development of the Atlantic Niño tends to be marked by emerging stationary patterns centered mid-basin. This is in stark contrast to El Niño, which can often develop as warm sea surface temperature anomalies that migrate west from the coast of South America or migrate east from the central Pacific.|$|E

5000|$|The {{focus of}} {{classical}} test theory (CTT) is on determining error of the measurement.

Although e could represent {{many different types of}} error, such as rater or instrument error, CTT only allows us to estimate one type of error at a time. Essentially it throws all sources of error into one error term. This may be suitable in the context of highly controlled laboratory conditions, but variance is a part of everyday life. In field research, for example, it is unrealistic to expect that the conditions of measurement will remain constant. Generalizability theory acknowledges and allows for variability in assessment conditions that may affect measurements.

50|$|Bühlmann {{credibility}} {{works by}} looking at the Variance across the population.

Say we have a basketball team with a high number of points per game. Sometimes they get 128 and other times they get 130 but always one of the two. Compared to all basketball teams this is a relatively low variance, meaning that they will contribute very little to the Expect Value of the Process Variance. Also, their unusually high point totals greatly increases the variance of the population, meaning that if the league booted them out, they'd have a much more predictable point total for each team (lower variance). So, this team is definitely unique (they contribute greatly to the Variance of the Hypothetical Mean). So we can rate this team's experience with a fairly high credibility. They often/always score a lot (low Expected Value of Process Variance) and not many teams score as much as them (high Variance of Hypothetical Mean).|$|E
