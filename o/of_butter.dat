5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> and the opportunity cost of guns in terms <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> is 4.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> at a low level <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

40|$|A set {{of factors}} has been {{identified}} to affect consumption <b>of</b> reduced-fat peanut <b>butter</b> in addition to regular peanut butter. We found that consumption <b>of</b> reduced-fat peanut <b>butter,</b> which is an imperfect substitute for regular peanut butter, may expand total demand for peanut butter. Interestingly, for those who usually buy the same brand <b>of</b> peanut <b>butter,</b> their consumption <b>of</b> reduced-fat peanut <b>butter</b> is more likely in addition to consumption <b>of</b> regular peanut <b>butter,</b> implying promotion <b>of</b> a specific brand <b>of</b> reduced-fat peanut <b>butter</b> tend to increase total demand for the same brand <b>of</b> peanut <b>butter.</b> reduced-fat peanut butter, regular peanut butter, Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R

5|$|The {{debut of}} deep-fried butter in 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada {{may have led}} to a rise in {{attendance}} at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds <b>of</b> <b>butter.</b> The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E
5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E

5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|Prices {{remained}} high in Dawson {{and supply}} fluctuated {{according to the}} season. During the winter of 1897 salt became worth its weight in gold, while nails, vital for construction work, rose in price to $28 ($760) per lb (0.45kg). Cans <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> sold for $5 ($140) each. The only eight horses in Dawson were slaughtered for dog food as {{they could not be}} kept alive over the winter. The first fresh goods arriving in the spring of 1898 sold for record prices, eggs reaching $3 ($81) each and apples $1 ($27).|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} composition <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> which {{contribute to}} butter's distinct flavor includes: fatty acids, lactones, methyl ketones, diacetyl and dimethyl sulfide.
