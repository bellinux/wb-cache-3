40|$|Abstract. An {{optimizing}} design idea {{is produced}} for {{the structure of}} top beam of electrostatic precipitator casing. The thermos cabinet and the original box shaped top beam of casing compose a truss beam system whose <b>overall</b> <b>section</b> height is increased greatly, resultantly, the bend bearing capacity of truss beam increases significantly {{than that of the}} original top beam of casing. Consequently, the wall thickness of box section of the original top beam can be reduced so that the steel consumption can be saved. Based on a practical project, the load effects on truss beam were investigated, respectively, including the air pressure difference and the temperature difference among external layer, thermos cabinet and interior of casing. Besides, the evaluation method of internal force in truss beam was investigated and the selective preference of truss beam configuration was conducted. The unfavorable load cases of air pressure difference and temperature difference are proposed for truss beam design. Besides, the accurate evaluation method of internal force and the design method for economical configuration of truss are proposed. In consideration of load bearing effect of thermos cabinet layer, the optimized design of truss beam originating from box sectioned top beam can ensure the truss works safely and reduce the steel consumption significantly...|$|E

To date, considerable amount of research {{have been carried out}} to aid the understanding of its concrete mixture designs and its material properties, but, only limited amount of works have been carried out to aid the current understanding with respect to its shear resistance. The main objective of this research was to investigate the shear resistance of Oil Palm kernel Shell Concrete (OPSC), and to compare with the conventional Normal Weight Concrete (NWC) through experimental and analytical study. The experimental work carried out in this research involved destructive testing of forty-five numbers of beam specimens, of which twenty-nine beams (24 casted with OPSC and 5 casted with NWC) were casted without shear reinforcement while the remaining sixteen beams (11 casted with OPSC and 5 casted with NWC) were casted with shear reinforcement. The main variables for beams casted without shear reinforcement were the concrete strength (fcu), <b>overall</b> <b>section</b> depth (h), longitudinal reinforcement (ρ), and span to depth ratio (a/d).

40|$|A 2 -D seismic line using four-component (4 -C) receivers- a 3 -C {{geophone}} and hydrophone- {{laid on the}} sea bottom {{was acquired}} in 1996 by PGS. The survey was undertaken by Amoco and its partners over the Valhall Field, offshore Norway. The main objective of the survey {{was to provide a}} better image of a chalk reservoir. Converted (P-S) waves are used, as P-P waves are strongly attenuated and scattered due to the presence of gas in the layers over the reservoir. The vertical component of the geophone and hydrophone showed a largely reflection-free zone for the target at the middle of the section. Four processing flows were applied to the radial receiver component: conventional CDP processing (for possible P-S-S events, i. e., a conversion at the sea bottom), common conversion point (CCP) asymptotic binning, P-S DMO, and equivalent offset migration (EOM). We did not find convincing evidence of a P-S-S event. The final result for the radial component processed for P-S events was good, as a continuous image for the target was obtained. A very good <b>overall</b> <b>section</b> was generated using the asymptotic binning method. The EOM method gave better results than converted-wave DMO at practically the same CPU time. The transverse component has reflections for the same events mapped by the radial component, but with much lower continuity. To investigate the presence of P-wave energy on the radial and transverse components, the processing flow for the P-P wave was applied to the radial and transverse data. In addition, the asymptotic binning P-S flow was applied to the vertical channel data. The results show that: 1) little P-S energy is present on the vertical component, and 2) only small P-P energy occurs in radial and transverse components. Severe periodic notches in the amplitude spectra, probably due to reverberation in the water layer, were observed in all components. An algorithm is being developed to attenuate the reverberation in the geophone (mainly for the radial component, where the signal bandwidth is strongly affected) using the hydrophone measurements...|$|E
40|$|Critics {{of higher}} fuel economy {{standards}} for vehicles have long argued that improving vehicle fuel economy will require reducing vehicle weight, and {{that would result in}} {{an increase in the number}} of fatalities from vehicle crashes. Several researchers have estimated that an across-the-board reduction of vehicle weight would reduce passenger safety (Evans 1991; Kahane 1997; U. S. GAO 1994). However, little research has been done on the relationship of vehicle size and fatality rates, independent of weight (see, however, Joksch, Massie, and Pichler 1998). In this report we review previous analyses of the relationship of vehicle weight and safety. We do this to study the opportunities to improve fuel economy in a more sophisticated way than across-the-board mass reduction. The aim is to explore improvements in traffic safety by making selected vehicle groups lighter, and retaining or enlarging selected vehicle dimensions. Unfortunately, the effects of size and mass have not been accurately separated in the crash fatality data, so some of our claims are only supported by general arguments from physics. In a follow-up report we will attempt to analyze crash fatality data to determine crash worthiness if the weight of certain vehicle groups would be decreased while maintaining or increasing vehicle size. The first section of this report provides an introduction to fatal vehicle crashes in the United States. We summarize several trends in automotive crash statistics over the last 20 years. Then we discuss approaches analysts have taken in studying factors that affect ''exposure'', the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash. In Section 2 we discuss standardized crash tests and the basic physics of crashes. We review previous research on the effect of vehicle mass in two-vehicle crashes in Section 3. We also present new research on reductions in risk achieved by recent light vehicles.

These aircraft have been own mostly as lead planes during the 2009 through 2013 fire seasons accumulating 3094 useful flights from 4074 flight files. These flights account for nearly 5772 hours in flight time. The results have been presented in two forms; 1) for overall flights and 2) for six specific flight phases. The information in the <b>overall</b> <b>section</b> have been further split into Firefighting/Ferry and Extreme Attitude flights. The usage results presented include information about the maximum MSL altitudes, maximum indicated airspeeds, pitch and roll angles, and load factors presented in the form of V-n diagrams. In some cases, the maximum indicated airspeed is shown to be in excess of the published limits, but within 10 % of the limit. In the case of one model, the vertical load factors {{have been shown to be}} larger than the operational limits. The flight loads, due to gust and maneuver, and discrete gust velocities, have been presented in the form of exceedance charts, normalized in per 1000 hours and per nautical mile. The flight loads and discrete gust velocities have been shown to correlate better with AGL than MSL altitudes. The loads and the discrete gust velocities from Firefighting and Extreme Attitude flights have been demonstrated to have higher frequencies of occurrence compared to Ferry flights. The highest frequencies of occurrences of gust and maneuver loads and discrete gust velocities have been shown to be associated with the Lead phase, and the lowest with the Entry phase. These aircraft were not designed for firefighting missions but now fly in a unique operating environment. Because of the mission-specific performance demands, the operators, manufacturers, and the regulators could use the statistical data from this investigation to understand their impact on the fatigue life of the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|T he {{concept of}} {{perpetual}} pavements, orlong-lasting asphalt pavements, is notnew. Actually, full-depth and deep-strength asphalt pavement structures {{have been constructed}} since the 1960 s. Full-depth pavements are constructed directly on subgrade soils, and deep-strength sections are placed on relatively thin granular base courses. One of the chief advantages of these pavements is that the <b>overall</b> <b>section</b> of the pavement is thinner than those employing thick granular base courses. As a result, the potential for traditional fatigue cracking may be reduced, and pavement distress may be confined to the upper layer of the structure. Both are advantages to perpetual pavements. Thus, when surficial distress reaches a critical level, an economical solution is to remove the very top layer and replace it to the same level. Recent efforts in materials selection, mixture design, performance testing, and pavement design offer a methodology to obtaining long-lasting performance from asphalt pavement structures (greater than 50 years) while periodically replacing the pavement surface. The thrust is to combine a rut resistant, impermeable, and wear resistant top structural layer with a rut resistant and durable intermediate layer and a fatigue resistant and durable base layer as shown in Figure 1. Though {{the use of a}} perpetual pavement is focused at high-volume traffic, the justification may be made for medium- and low-volume roads as well. The criteria used in Maryland and California for high-volume traffic is discussed below. Maryland incorporates a thick asphalt structure surfaced with a stone matrix asphalt (SMA) on roads where the posted speed limit is 55 mph or greater, and the traffic is at 2000 equivalent single axle load (ESAL) /day or greater. California uses such designs when the truck traffic exceeds 15, 000 vehicles/day or the average daily traffic is greater than 150, 000 vehicles/day. Thus, it is conceivable, that with the right design approach, the use of perpetual pave-ments could become common on medium- and low-volume roads as well. Currently, most pavement design procedures do not consider each pavement layer to explain its characteristics relating t...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis investigated the flexural fatigue behaviour of non-corroded and corroded pretensioned beams and examined the use of externally bonded Carbon Fibre Reinforcement Polymer (CFRP) sheets as a repair technique aimed at restoring the loss in capacity due to corrosion. This was accomplished through an extensive experimental and analytical program. The experimental program was comprised of a material testing phase and a beam testing phase. The material testing phase consisted of testing seventy-two (72) material samples under monotonic and cyclic axial loading, full strand testing, and corrosion measurements of prestressing strands corroded while embedded in concrete prism. Material testing achieved multiple objectives: (a) it identified the rate of accelerated corrosion of the prestressing strands, (b) it quantified {{the distribution of the}} applied nominal tensile force among the seven wires within a single 7 -wire strand in a prestressed strand, (c) it determined the material fatigue properties, and the stress-strain behaviour of the strand wires, and (d) it quantified the stress concentration factor in the prestressing strand due to corrosion. The beam testing involved constructing thirty-seven (37) 3. 6 m long pretensioned T-beams and testing them in a four-point bending configuration. Twelve (12) beams were tested under monotonic loading, and twenty-five (25) beams were tested under cyclic loading. The main testing variables included: the corrosion level, the applied stress range, and a repair or the lack of it. Corrosion resulted in a significant deterioration of the monotonic and fatigue resistance of the beams in comparison to non-corroded beams, and repair using externally bonded CFRP sheet restored all or most of the monotonic and fatigue resistance lost due to corrosion. All beams failed by rupture of the prestressing strand. Inspection of the strand’s fracture surface showed signs of surface fretting. In addition, the fracture profile was similar to that reported by Toribio and Ovejero (2005) for hydrogen induced stress cracking of heavily cold drawn prestressing wires. Strands having corrosion levels of 5 % and 10 % by mass loss exhibited an <b>overall</b> <b>section</b> loss together with distinct deep corrosion pits. In the analysis phase, fatigue data measured from smooth axial samples taken from the centre wire of a prestrssing strand was used to model the fatigue behaviour of the outer wires of the 7 -wire prestressing strand for corroded and non-corroded pretensioned beams. Strain-based fracture mechanics was employed in all the analyses, which included the flexure fatigue behaviour of: non-corroded and corroded single prestressing wires-in-air, a full 7 -wire prestressing strand-in-air, and a non-corroded and corroded 7 -wire prestressing strand in a beam. The mode results correlated well with the observed experimental results. This thesis presents extensive experimental work, along with an in depth fatigue analysis that is based on material fatigue properties obtained from simple single wire cyclic testing. The resulting modelling approach offers a mechanistic explanation of 7 -wire prestressing strand failure under various conditions...|$|E
