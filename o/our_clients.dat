500|$|On September 29, 2009, Randazza {{requested}} that Beck voluntarily {{ask that the}} First Amendment {{be applied to the}} arbitration case, despite its international setting. Randazza made this request because Beck's political commentary favored the United States Constitution over international law. Randazza's September 29, 2009 letter to Beck's attorneys cited statements by Beck in which he indicated he preferred United States law over international law. Beck had said, [...] "Once we sign our rights over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead." [...] Randazza's letter concluded: [...] "I am certain that neither party wishes to see First Amendment rights subordinated to international trademark principles, thus unwittingly proving Mr. Beck's point. Lest this case become an example of international law causing damage to the constitutional rights that both of <b>our</b> <b>clients</b> hold dear, I respectfully request that your client agree to stipulate to the application of American constitutional law to this case." ...|$|E

2500|$|The CDC’s initial {{reaction}} to calls of the revising the AIDS definition included setting {{the threshold of}} AIDS {{for both men and}} women at a T cell count of under 200. However, McGovern dismissed this suggestion. “Lots of women who show up at hospitals don’t get T cells taken. No one knows they have HIV. I knew how many of <b>our</b> <b>clients</b> were dying of AIDS and not counted.” [...] Rather, McGovern, along with the ACLU and the New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, called for adding fifteen conditions to the list of the CDC’s surveillance case definition, which was eventually adopted in January 1993. Six months later, the Clinton administration revised federal criteria for evaluating HIV status and making it easier for women with AIDS to secure Social Security benefits. The Women’s Caucus’ role in altering the CDC’s definition helped to not only drastically increase availability of federal benefits to American women, but helped uncover a more accurate number of HIV/AIDS infected women in the United States; “under the new model, the number of women with AIDS in the United States increased almost 50 percent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs US equity {{derivatives}} sales {{business in}} Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via a critical letter printed as an op-ed in The New York Times. In the letter, he attacked Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein for losing {{touch with the}} company's culture, which he described as [...] "the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years." [...] Smith said that advising clients [...] "to do what I believe is right for them" [...] was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a [...] "toxic and destructive" [...] environment in which [...] "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as [...] "" [...] and colleagues callously talked about [...] "ripping their clients off". In reply, Goldman Sachs said that [...] "we will only be successful if <b>our</b> <b>clients</b> are successful", claiming [...] "this fundamental truth {{lies at the heart}} of how we conduct ourselves" [...] and that [...] "we don't think [...] reflect the way we run our business." [...] Later that year, Smith published a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs.|$|E

During the baling process, the operator tries to place bales at an angle to prevent rollaway bales. <b>Our</b> <b>client</b> has created a self-loading bale trailer that can be pulled by either a tractor or a pickup truck. The goal was to eliminate the need for a loader in the field and be able to pick up bales on the move. The trailer must pick up and haul seven bales safe and efficiently. Another feature of this trailer is when picking up corn stalk/ hay bales, the operator can drive with the rows to reduce stress on equipment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We are {{reporting}} {{what we believe}} to be the first published case of patient initiated direct to consumer (DTC) genetic testing to test for the presence of a known familial mutation. <b>Our</b> <b>client</b> in this case is from a known MSH 2 family; both his/her parent and associated grandparent have previously tested positive for the known familial MSH 2 mutation. Using 23 andme’s “family inheritance genomewide comparison ” option we were able to determine that <b>our</b> <b>client</b> most likely inherited the known familial MSH 2 mutation without pursuing single site genetic testing. <b>Our</b> <b>client</b> pursued DTC genetic testing instead of single site genetic testing due to the fear of genetic discrimination. This case shows that patients are still fearful of genetic discrimination, despite the passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), and that DTC genetic testing may be useful despite the overall negative feeling towards this type of testing in the genetic counseling community...|$|R
