5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were planted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches,</b> and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b>|$|E

5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5|$|New Mexicos next {{task in the}} Philippines was {{the liberation}} of Luzon. She {{took part in the}} pre-invasion {{shelling}} of Lingayen Gulf on 6 January. During the bombardment she came under heavy attack by kamikazes, one of which hit her bridge, killing her commanding officer, Captain Robert Walton Fleming, and 29 others. The dead included Lieutenant General Herbert Lumsden, the British representative to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. A further 87 of her crew were wounded. Bruce Fraser, the commander of the British Pacific Fleet, narrowly escaped death while on her bridge, although his secretary was killed. The guns remained in action as the ship's crew repaired the damage while the invasion troops were landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sand art is {{a special}} art form that is created <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Puri. The art form is {{attributed}} to Balaram Das, a poet {{who lived in the}} 14th century. Sculptures of various gods and famous people are now created in sand by amateur artists. These are temporary in nature as they get washed away by waves. This art form has gained international fame in recent years. One of the famed sand artists of Odisha is Sudarshan Patnaik. He established the Golden Sand Art Institute in 1995, in the open air on the shores of Bay of Bengal, to provide training to students interested in this art form.|$|E

5|$|The Baltic Sea coast {{has been}} a source of Eurasian amber trade since prehistoric times (see Amber Road). Neolithic {{artifacts}} made of amber were discovered in nearby Juodkrantė in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the 20th century. Lithuanian mythology, folklore, and art have long associations with amber; the legend of Jūratė and Kastytis imagines an undersea palace of amber under the Baltic, which was shattered by Perkūnas, the god of thunder. Its fragments were said to be the source of the amber that still washes up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> nearby.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The {{vicinity}} of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and traffic jams <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance of}} the 18th RCT cleared away the last {{remnants}} of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up {{the western side of}} this draw, it became the main route inland off the beaches. With the congestion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E-1 draw.|$|E

5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast and increase pressure on the German forces by opening another front. After some preliminary commando operations, including the British 4th Para's landing behind enemy lines to secure vital transport links, the US VI Corps landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of the Côte d'Azur under the shield of a large naval task force, followed by several divisions of the French Army B. They were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G, which had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate Ostlegionen outfitted with obsolete equipment.|$|E
5|$|The next day, an {{additional}} 53,823 men were embarked, {{including the first}} French soldiers. Lord Gort and 68,014 men were evacuated on 31 May, leaving Major-General Harold Alexander {{in command of the}} rearguard. A further 64,429 Allied soldiers departed on 1 June, before the increasing air attacks prevented further daylight evacuation. The British rearguard of 4,000 men left on the night of 2–3 June. An additional 75,000 French troops were retrieved over the nights of 2–4 June, before the operation finally ended. The remainder of the rearguard—40,000 French troops—surrendered on 4 June. Churchill made a point of stating in his We shall fight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> address in the House on 4 June, that the evacuation had been made possible through the efforts of the RAF.|$|E
5|$|While the {{hurricane}} itself never approached the United States, heavy surf and rip currents were reported <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Florida. One person drowned {{and at least}} 35people had to be rescued from the turbulent waters at Siesta Key caused by Hurricane Dean. Rough seas produced by Dean caused minor flooding in Dauphin Island, Alabama. Damages from the flooding amounted to $100,000. The remnant circulation of Dean, after lingering off the Pacific Coast, moved inland by Santa Barbara, California, and brought heavy thunderstorms and localized flooding to coastal Southern California {{on the morning of}} August 26. The remnants crossed the Mojave Desert on the morning of August 27. Las Vegas, received a daily record of 0.58in (15mm) of rain, with flash flooding and minor damage.|$|E

5|$|With {{the victory}} at Magdhaba the {{occupation}} of El Arish was secure. This was the first town captured on the Mediterranean coast and infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade quickly began to fortify the town. The Royal Navy arrived on 22 December 1916, and supplies began landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> near El Arish on 24 December.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler {{had ordered the}} {{construction}} of fortifications he called the Atlantic Wall all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. Concrete gun emplacements were constructed at strategic points along the coast, and wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles were placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. In addition to several static infantry divisions, eleven panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions were deployed nearby. Four of these formations were Waffen-SS divisions. In addition, the SS-Das Reich was located in Southern France, the LSSAH was in Belgium refitting after fighting in the Soviet Union, and the newly formed panzer division SS-Hitlerjugend, consisting of 17- and 18-year-old Hitler Youth members supported by combat veterans and experienced NCOs, was stationed west of Paris. The creation of the SS-Hitlerjugend {{was a sign of}} Hitler's desperation for more troops, especially ones with unquestioning obedience.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches.</b> They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|During the day, the French {{strengthened}} {{the positions of}} both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified by Trial, which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was in better condition and remained well protected. Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable.|$|E
