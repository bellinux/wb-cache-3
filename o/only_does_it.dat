25|$|The {{success of}} the tube map {{as a piece of}} {{information}} design has led to many imitations of its format. What is probably the earliest example is the Sydney Suburban and City Underground railway map of 1939. Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> follow Beck's styling cues, but in size, design and layout it is a near-clone to the London map of the late 1930s, right down {{to the use of the}} Underground roundel.|$|E

25|$|In {{northern}} Europe, the fly lays its eggs in sheep wool. The larvae then migrate {{down the}} wool where they feed {{directly on the}} skin surface. This can cause massive lesions and secondary bacterial infections. In the UK, blow fly strike affects an estimated 1 million sheep, as well as 80% of sheep farms each year. This causes a huge economic impact in these regions. Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> cost money to treat infected animals, but measures also {{must be taken to}} control L. sericata.|$|E
25|$|NY218 sees much traffic {{despite its}} short length. Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> bring {{most of the}} United States Military Academy's traffic to Thayer Gate, its main entrance, it attracts many who drive it {{just for the sake}} of its most renowned portion: the cliffside drive {{alongside}} Storm King Mountain. In good weather during the summer months many cars can be seen taking in the views of the river and the Hudson Highlands here (however, this section can be gated off and closed in times of high rockslide danger).|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid is a diprotic {{acid and}} shows {{different}} properties depending upon its concentration. Its corrosiveness on other materials, like metals, living tissues or even stones, can be mainly ascribed to its strong acidic nature and, if concentrated, strong dehydrating and oxidizing properties. It is also hygroscopic, readily absorbing water vapour from the air. Sulfuric acid {{at a high}} concentration can cause very serious damage upon contact, since not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> cause chemical burns via hydrolysis, but also secondary thermal burns through dehydration. It can lead to permanent blindness if splashed onto eyes and irreversible damage if swallowed.|$|E

25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, Weeble or roly-poly toy (see left figure). Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> have a low center of mass, {{but it also has}} a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point are on the line perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts away from that line. This produces a righting moment which returns the toy to the equilibrium position.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E
25|$|The wolf plays a {{prominent}} role in the Serer religion's creation myth, where it is viewed as the first living creature created by Roog, the Supreme God and Creator. In one aspect, it can be viewed as an Earth-diver sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen prophet for disobeying the laws of the divine. The wolf was the first intelligent creature on earth, and it is believed that it will remain on earth after human beings have returned to the divine. The Serers believe that, not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> know in advance who will die, but it traces the tracks in advance of those who will go to funerals. The movements of the wolf are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a seer who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it. Although believed to be rejected in the bush by other animals and deprived of its original intelligence, it is still respected because it dared to resist the supreme being who still keeps it alive.|$|E

25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.|$|E

Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> cut time off the flight, it also nets fuel savings for the airline industry.

[...] The size and gaps of the teeth are tapered in this method of design. [...] That is, the teeth can be different sizes according to their position in the filter, compared with an image design where all sections are identical. [...] With this approach, the original specification for passband and stopband can be kept while simultaneously improving the impedance matching. [...] The stepped impedance transformers can be dispensed with, or at least significantly reduced in size.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Victor {{has been used}} as a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers and appeared in an advert for it. The commercials aired in November 1998. In the adverts, Victor breaks the proverbial fourth wall, and begins speaking to the Zellers shopper on the other side of the television screen, praising her admirable combination of style and thrift. He steps closer and squashes his nose against the camera lens. According to the website StrategyOnline, the promotional ad campaign for Zellers featuring Victor proved to be the most popular installment to date as of May 1999; the staff of StrategyOnline wrote that the campaign [...] "has garnered considerable praise in the marketing community – and small wonder. Not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> perform the considerable task of balancing an affordability message with strong branding, it does so in a category seldom noted for the quality of strategic thinking that goes into its advertising." ...|$|E
500|$|Music appears {{throughout}} Angelou's third autobiography, {{starting with}} the title, which evokes a blues song and references the beginnings of Angelou's career in music and performance. She starts Singin' and Swingin {{the same way she}} starts Caged Bird: with an epigraph to set the tone. Here, the epigraph is a quotation from an unidentified three-line stanza in classic blues form. After the epigraph, [...] "music" [...] is the first word in the book. As the story opens, a lonely Angelou finds solace in Black music, and is soon hired as a salesgirl in a record store on Fillmore Street in San Francisco. She meets and falls in love with her first husband after she discovers their shared appreciation of Black music. After learning of her grandmother's death, her reaction, [...] "a dazzling passage three paragraphs long" [...] according to Mary Jane Lupton, is musical; not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> rely upon gospel tradition, but is also influenced by African American literary texts, especially James Weldon Johnson's [...] "Go Down Death—A Funeral Sermon".|$|E
500|$|...hack//Mutation also {{received}} mixed reviews, and many critics complained that little {{was done to}} address the problems of its predecessor. Fennec Fox of Gamepro said that game, [...] "is simply an extension of Infection", with [...] "muddy graphics, questionable control, and a story concept that’s just interesting enough to keep you going." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot gave it a rating of 6.7 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> bring you exactly the same sort of repetitive hack-and-slash gameplay, but it's also similarly short and simple and once again offers {{little in the way of}} plot or character development." [...] Nutt found the second game to be more addictive than the first, despite its numerous shortcomings such as obvious padding towards the end of the story. He praised the [...] "mixture of cool story and viscerally engaging RPG gameplay", the accelerating story, gameplay progression and memorable boss battles. Other reviewers were encouraged by the MMORPG-oriented details that contribute to the game's presentation and built excitement for the future of the series. IGN also named [...]hack//Mutation as PlayStation2 Game of the Month for May 2003.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Johnson and Chinn shows the contradictions within slavery at the time. For one, not <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> indicate that even then that [...] "kin {{could also be}} property," [...] {{but it is an}} interesting case because Johnson was open about his relationship with Chinn, calling her [...] "my bride" [...] on at least one occasion, with both of them acting like a married couple, and oral tradition recalling that other slaves at Great Crossings worked on their wedding. As part of their relationship, Chinn gained more responsibilities. As she spent much of her time in the [...] "plantation's big house," [...] a two-story brick home, she managed Johnson's estate for at least half of each year, with her purview later expanding to all of his property, even acting as [...] "Richard's representative" [...] and allowing her to handle money. This gave, as historical scholar Christina Snyder argues, some independence, since Johnson told his white employees that Chinn's authority must be respected, and her role allowing her children's lives to be different from [...] "others of African descent at Great Crossings," [...] giving them levels of privileged access within the plantation. This was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Chinn was still enslaved but supervised the work of slaves, with the Chinn family never sold or mortgaged off, but she did not have the power to [...] "challenge the institution of slavery or overturn the government that supported it," [...] she only had the power to gain some personal autonomy, with Johnson never legally emancipating her. This may have been because, as Snyder says, liberating her from human bondage would erode [...] "ties that bound her to him" [...] and keeping her enslaved supported his idea of being a [...] "benevolent patriarch." ...|$|E
