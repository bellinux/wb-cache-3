This paper focuses on <b>optical</b> <b>mixing</b> error in eight-pass interferometers. A mathematical model is built. Experimental data are obtained and compared to the model. It is found that, unlike two-pass interferometers, the eight-pass interferometer has eight error components due to <b>optical</b> <b>mixing</b> and it still takes half a wavelength displacement for the slowest component to complete a cycle of variation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Attempts to {{understand}} circadian {{organization in the}} mammalian retina have concentrated increasingly on the mouse. However, rather little is known regarding circadian control of retinal light responses in this species. Here, the authors address this deficit using electroretinogram (ERG) recordings in C 57 BL/ 6 mice to evaluate rhythmicity in the wild-type retina and to identify the consequences of circadian clock loss in Cry 1 (- /-) Cry 2 (-/-) mice. They observe a circadian rhythm in the ERG waveform under light-adapted, cone-isolating conditions in wild-type mice, with b-wave speed and amplitude and the total power of oscillatory potentials all enhanced during the day. Wild types also exhibited a circadian dependence to ERG amplitude under dark-adapted conditions, but only when the flash stimulus was sufficiently bright to lie within the response range of cones. Cry 1 (-/ -) Cry 2 (-/-) mice lacked rhythmicity but retained superficially normal ERGs under all conditions suggesting that circadian clocks are dispensable for general retinal function. However, clock loss was associated with subtle abnormalities in retinal responses, with the amplitude of cone and <b>mixed</b> <b>rod</b> + cone ERGs constitutively enhanced. These data suggest that circadian clocks drive a fundamental fine-tuning of retinal pathways that is particularly apparent under conditions in which vision relies upon either cones alone or <b>mixed</b> <b>rod</b> + cone photoreception...|$|R

To test the probe, we conducted matching experiments in which inexperienced observers were instructed to adjust the modes of the probe to match its material to that of a test stimulus. Observers were well able to handle the probe and match the perceived materials. Results were robust across individuals, across combinations of materials, and across lighting conditions.

40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of wavelength conversion based on nondegenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) with two pumps is theo-retically evaluated in a silicon nanowire waveguide. A theoretical model is developed {{to take into}} the limitations of nonlinear loss parameters on conversion bandwidth, efficiency, and uniformity. Analysis shows that the conversion bandwidth of two-pump nonde-generate FWM is % broader than the conversion bandwidth of the degenerate FWM without compromising the conversion ef-ficiency under the same pump power level. Also the results indi-cate that the improvement originates from efficient phase matching over broader bandwidth range due to two-wavelength pumps.
