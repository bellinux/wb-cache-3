We describe the history <b>of</b> science <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> and consider its future by focusing on <b>teacher</b> qualifications, recruitment <b>of</b> <b>teacher</b> candidates, types <b>of</b> science <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programmes and teaching internships. This history indicates that the educational reform in 1999 had {{a big impact on}} science teacher preparation. Science <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programmes have been developed in order to produce constructivist science teachers. Recently, two types <b>of</b> science <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programmes have emerged: a five-year bachelor programme and a two-year master’s programme. These programmes have been centrally framed by the <b>Teacher</b> Qualification Standards <b>of</b> the <b>Teacher</b> Council <b>of</b> Thailand (TCT). Even though each university has the authority to design its own courses and activities, the licensing, requirements and structure <b>of</b> the <b>teacher</b> <b>education</b> programme must follow the framework of TCT and the Higher Education Commission. The challenges that these programmes face are providing sufficient teacher preparation in respect to pedagogical content knowledge and reflective and research-based activities.
