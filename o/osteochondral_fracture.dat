40|$|BACKGROUND:Osteochondral {{fractures}} {{are often}} seen on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) of acutely injured knees, but their existence has gained little interest {{because of a lack}} of knowledge of their relation to treatment options and outcome. It is not clear whether acute phase synovial fluid (SF) concentrations of cartilage and bone markers and proinflammatory cytokines are different between traumatically injured knees with or without <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture.</b> HYPOTHESIS:Acutely injured knees with an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture,</b> particularly fractures with disrupted cortical bone, have higher concentrations of bone markers and cytokines than do knees without an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture.</b> STUDY DESIGN:Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS:Synovial fluid (hemarthrosis) was aspirated (median 1 day after injury) and 1. 5 -T MRI was performed (median 8 days after injury) in the acutely injured knee of 98 individuals (26 % women; mean age, 23 years). As visualized on MRI, 39 % knees had an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> with disrupted cortical bone, 30 % had an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> with intact cortical bone, and 32 % did not have an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture.</b> Concentrations of sulfated glycosaminoglycan, ARGS aggrecan, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, osteocalcin, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), osteopontin and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) were analyzed. RESULTS:After adjusting for days between injury and SF aspiration, age at injury, and sex, knees with any <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> (with or without disrupted cortical bone) had significantly higher SF concentrations of TNF-α (median [interquartile range (IQR) ] = 9 [7 - 12] pg/mL vs 7 [5 - 14] pg/mL; P =. 013), whereas knees with an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> with disrupted cortical bone had significantly higher SF concentrations (medians [IQRs]) of SPARC (492 [328 - 754] ng/mL vs 407 [140 - 685] ng/mL; P =. 030), IL- 8 (278 [148 - 628] pg/mL vs 138 [67 - 413] pg/mL; P =. 028), and TNF-α (11 [7 - 15] pg/mL vs 7 [5 - 14] pg/mL; P =. 004) compared with knees without an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture.</b> CONCLUSION:In acutely injured knees with hemarthrosis, a concomitant <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> with disrupted cortical bone is associated with a higher degree of joint inflammation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractInaugural {{traumatic}} patellar dislocation is {{most often}} due to trauma sustained during physical or sports activity. Two-thirds of acute patellar dislocations occur in young active patients (less than 20  years old). Non-contact knee sprain in flexion and valgus is the leading mechanism in patellar dislocation, accounting {{for as many as}} 93 % of all cases. The strong displacement of the patella tears the medial stabilizing structures, and notably the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), which is almost always injured in acute patellar dislocation, most frequently at its femoral attachment. Lateral patellar glide can be assessed with the knee in extension or 20 ° flexion. Displacement by more than 50 % of the patellar width is considered abnormal and may induce apprehension. Plain X-ray and CT are mandatory to diagnose bony risk factors for patellar dislocation, such as trochlear dysplasia or increased tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance (TT-TG), and plan correction. MRI gives information on cartilage and capsulo-ligamentous status for treatment planning: free bodies or <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> have to be treated surgically.

40|$|SummaryTreatment of knee {{cartilage}} defect, a true challenge, {{should not}} only reconstruct hyaline cartilage on a long-term basis, but {{also be able to}} prevent osteoarthritis. Osteochondral knee lesions occur in either traumatic lesions or in osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). These lesions can involve all the articular surfaces of the knee in its three compartments. In principle, this review article covers symptomatic ICRS grade C or D lesions, depth III and IV, excluding management of superficial lesions, asymptomatic lesions that are often discovered unexpectedly, and kissing lesions, which arise prior to or during osteoarthritis. For clarity sake, the international classifications used are reviewed, for both functional assessment (ICRS and functional IKDC for <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fractures,</b> Hughston for osteochondritis) and morphological lesion evaluations (the ICRS macroscopic evaluation for fractures, the Bedouelle or SOFCOT for osteochondritis, and MOCART for MRI). The therapeutic armamentarium to treat these lesions is vast, but accessibility varies greatly depending on the country and the legislation in effect. Many comparative studies have been conducted, but they are rarely of high scientific quality; the center effect is nearly constant because patients are often referred to certain centers for an expert opinion. The indications defined herein use algorithms that take into account the size of the cartilage defect and the patient's functional needs for cases of fracture and the vitality, stability, and size of the fragment for cases of osteochondritis dissecans. Fractures measuring less than 2 cm 2 are treated with either microfracturing or mosaic osteochondral grafting, between 2 and 4 cm 2 with microfractures covered with a membrane or a culture of second- or third-generation chondrocytes, and beyond this size, giant lesions are subject to an exceptional allografting procedure, harvesting from the posterior condyle, or chondrocyte culture on a 3 D matrix to restore volume. Cases of stable osteochondritis dissecans with closed articular cartilage can be simply monitored or treated with perforation in cases of questionable vitality. Cases of open joint cartilage are treated with a PLUS fixation if their vitality is preserved; if not, they are treated comparably to <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fractures,</b> with the type of filling depending on the defect size...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{patients}} with acute dislocation of the patella had associated osteochondral fractures. This fracture complicates approximately 5 per cent of all acute dislocations of the patella occurring in children. Three types of fracture patterns were noted. All {{patients who were}} freated by immediate arthrotomy and excision or replacement of the osteochondral fragment and repair of the acute dislocation of the patella made an uneventful recovery with no recurrence of the dislocation. In those patients in whom the osteochondral fragment was removed but with no repair the dislocation recurred. The recognition of an <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fracture</b> of the knee in association with acute dislocation of the patella may be difficult (Coleman 1948; McDougall and Brown 1968). The combined injury is uncommon; so unless it is suspected and carefully looked for it may easily be overlooked.

40|$|Injuries of the talus {{represents}} {{an important part}} of the foot and ankle trauma. Since talar bone connect the lower limb and foot, the sequelas of its trauma could have significant influence on the function of the whole lower limb and gait. The specific vascularization of the talus results in delayed union and even in the avascular necrosis. The diagnosis of the fractures of the talus can be made on the x-rays, but sometimes real picture of the fracture pattern can be seen only in the CT scans. Ocult <b>fractures</b> such as <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fractures</b> and avascular necrosis can be exactly detected on MRI in aim not to be overlookded as the ankle sprain diagnosis. The precise reduction and stable internal fixation is mandatory in the treatment to enable the anatomical position of the talonavicular, talocrural and subtalar joint and to make possible early motion and rehabilitation, without weight bearing. On the other hand, crushed fractures, open fractures and the Hawkins III - IV fractures with the dislocations of the talar body sometimes needs salvage procedures like Blair or tibio-talar or tibio-calcaneal fusion.

40|$|Context Patellar {{dislocation}} usually {{occurs to}} the lateral side, leading to ruptures of the Medial Patellofemoral Ligament (MPFL) in about 90 % of the cases. Even though several prognostic factors are identified for patellofemoral instability after patellar dislocation so far, the appropriate therapy remains a controversial issue. Evidence Acquisition Authors searched the Medline library {{for studies on}} both surgical and conservative treatment for patellar dislocation and patellofemoral instability. Additionally, the reference list of each article was searched for additional studies. Results A thorough analysis of the anatomical risk factors with a particular focus on patella alta, increased Tibial Tuberosity-Trochlear Groove (TT-TG) distance, trochlear dysplasia as well as torsional abnormalities should be performed early after the first dislocation to allow adequate patient counseling. Summarizing the results of all published randomized clinical trials and comparing surgical and conservative treatment after the first-time patellar dislocation until today indicated no significant evident difference for children, adolescents, and adults.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Osteochondral injuries, if {{not treated}} appropriately, {{often lead to}} severe {{osteoarthritis}} of the affected joint. Without refixation of the osteochondral fragment, human cartilage only repairs these defects imperfectly. All existing refixation systems for chondral defects have disadvantages, for instance bad MRI quality in the postoperative follow-up or low anchoring forces. To {{address the problem of}} reduced stability in resorbable implants, ultrasound-activated pins were developed. By ultrasound-activated melting of the tip of these implants a higher anchoring is assumed. Aim {{of the study was to}} investigate, if ultrasound-activated pins can provide a secure refixation of <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fractures</b> comparing to conventional screw and conventional, resorbable pin osteosynthesis. CT scans and scanning electron microscopy should proovegood refixation results with no further tissue damage by the melting of the ultrasound-activated pins in comparison to conventional osteosynthesis. Methods: Femoral osteochondral fragments in sheep were refixated with ultrasound-activated pins (SonicPin™), Ethipins ® and screws (Asnis™). The quality of the refixated fragments was examined after three month of full weight bearing by CT scans and scanning electron microscopy of the cartilage surface. Results: The CT examination found almost no statistically significant difference in the quality of refixation between the three different implants used. Concerning the CT morphology, ultrasound-activated pins demonstrated at least the same quality in refixation of osteochondral fragments as conventional resorbable pins or screws.

40|$|The {{subchondral}} bone {{is involved}} in a variety of diseases affecting both the articular cartilage and bone. Osteochondral defects in distinct locations and of variable sizes are the final results of different etiologies. These include traumatic osteochondral defects, osteochondritis dissecans, osteonecrosis, and osteoarthritis. Traumatic osteochondral defects are caused by <b>osteochondral</b> <b>fractures,</b> separating an <b>osteochondral</b> fragment that includes articular cartilage and both subchondral and trabecular bone from the joint surface. In osteochondritis dissecans, the disease originates in the subchondral bone and secondarily affects the articular cartilage. Location, stage, size, and depth of osteochondral lesions {{play a role in the}} treatment of traumatic osteochondral defects and osteochondritis dissecans. Surgical options include fragment refixation, transplantation of osteochondral autografts, or bone restoration by impacted cancellous bone grafts combined with autologous chondrocyte transplantation. An insufficiency fracture of the subchondral bone may be the initiating factor of what was formerly believed to be a spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK). Recent histopathological studies suggest that each stage of SPONK reflects different types of bone repair reactions following a fracture of the subchondral bone plate. Osteoarthritis is a disease that does affect not only the articular cartilage, but also the subchondral bone. Reconstructive surgical techniques aim at preserving joint function, inducing fibrocartilaginous repair, and at correcting malalignment.
