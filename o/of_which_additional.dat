The extent of winter injury had a marked effect on the increase in leaf area in spring, and the accumulation of plant d. wt {{was positively correlated with}} the percentage of total leaf area remaining undamaged at the end of winter. This, in turn, was strongly influenced by the interaction between powdery mildew and soil phosphate.

40|$|Odour baited traps have {{potential}} use in population surveillance of insect vectors of disease, {{and in some}} cases for vector population reduction. Established attractants for human host-seeking mosquitoes include a combination of CO 2 with L-lactic acid and ammonia, on top <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>additional</b> candidate compounds are being tested. In this field study in rural Gambia, using Latin square experiments with thorough randomization and replication, we tested nine different leading candidate combinations of chemical odorants for attractiveness to wild mosquitoes including anthropophilic malaria vectors, using modified Mosquito Magnet-X (MM-X) counterflow traps outside experimental huts containing male human sleepers. Highest catches of female mosquitoes, particularly of An. gambiae s. l. and Mansonia species, were obtained by incorporation of tetradecanoic acid. As additional carboxylic acids did not increase the trap catches further, this ‘reference blend ’ (tetradecanoic acid with L-lactic acid, ammonia and CO 2) was used in subsequent experiments. MM-X traps with this blend caught similar numbers of An. gambiae s. l. and slightly more Mansonia and Culex mosquitoes than a standard CDC light trap, and these numbers were not significantly affected by {{the presence or absence of}} human sleepers in the huts. Experiments with CO 2 produced from overnight yeast cultures showed that this organic source was effective in enabling trap attractiveness for all mosquito species, although at a slightly lower efficiency than obtained with use of CO 2 gas cylinders.

40|$|Non-small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) differ {{significantly}} in their clinical response to topoisomerase IIalpha (topo-IIalpha) -directed drugs, such as etoposide and teniposide, as NSCLC is virtually insensitive to single-agent therapy, while SCLC responds in two-thirds of cases. Preclinical {{studies have indicated}} that resistance to topo-IIalpha drugs depends on topo-IIalpha content and/or activity, the altered-topo-II multidrug resistance phenotype (at-MDR) and/or one of two different drug efflux pumps, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the multidrug resistance protein (MRP). Immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue from 27 cases of untreated NSCLC and 29 cases of untreated SCLC (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>additional</b> tumour biopsies after treatment with topo-IIalpha-directed drugs were available in ten cases) yielded the following results: NSCLC had significantly less topo-IIalpha than SCLC (P 5 % positive cells compared with 28 out of 29 SCLC, and 0 out of 27 NSCLC had > 25 % positive cells compared with 26 out of 29 SCLC. P-gp was detected in > 5 % of cells in only 3 out of 27 NSCLC and in 6 out of 29 SCLC, and MRP in 5 out of 27 of NSCLC and 9 out of 29 SCLC. After treatment of patients with SCLC with either etoposide or teniposide, which are topo-IIalpha-directed drugs, there was an increase in MRP (P < 0. 1) and P-gp (P < 0. 05) positivity, while topo-IIalpha decreased (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, the major difference between untreated NSCLC and SCLC was in topo-IIalpha content.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} clinical impact of incidental findings detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -enterography in patients with suspected or known Crohn’s disease (CD). METHODS: Incidental findings were defined as unexpected lesions outside the small intestine, not previously known or suspected {{at the time of}} referral, and not related to inflammatory bowel disease. Through a systematic review of medical charts we analyzed the clinical impact of incidental findings, and compared the MRI findings with subsequent diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were included in the analysis, and MRI detected active CD in 31 %, fistula in 1. 4 % and abscess in 0. 7 %. Extra-intestinal findings not related to CD were recorded in 72 patients (25 %), of which 58 patients (20 %) had 74 previously unknown lesions. Important or incompletely characterized findings were detected in 17 patients (6. 0 %). Incidental findings led to 12 further interventions in 9 patients (3. 2 %) revealing previously unknown pathological conditions in 5 (1. 8 %). One patient (0. 4 %) underwent surgery and one patient was diagnosed with a malignant disease. MRI detected incidental colonic lesions in 16 patients <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>additional</b> work-up in 4 revealed normal anatomy. Two patients (0. 7 %) benefitted from the additional examinations, whereas incidental findings led to unnecessary examinations in 9 (3. 2 %). CONCLUSION: In a minority of patients with suspected or known CD, important incidental findings are diagnosed at MRI-enterography. However, a substantial number of patients experience unnecessary morbidity because of additional examinations of benign or normal conditions...|$|E

40|$|Study objective: UK {{government}} policy mandates {{the introduction of}} ‘intermediate care services’ to reduce emergency admissions to hospital from the population aged 75 years or more. We evaluated one of these initiatives—the Keep Well At Home (KWAH) Project—in a West London Primary Care Trust. Design: KWAH involves a two-phase screening process, including a home visit by a community nurse. We employed cohort methods to determine whether KWAH resulted in fewer emergency attendances and admissions to hospital in the target population, from October 1999 to December 2002. Results: estimated levels of coverage in the two phases of screening were 61 and 32 %, respectively. The project had not maintained records <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>additional</b> health and social care services had been delivered following screening. The rates of emergency admissions to hospital in the 9 months before screening were similar in practices that did and did not join the project (rate ratio (RR) = 1. 05; 95 % CI 0. 95 – 1. 17), suggesting absence of volunteer bias. Over the first 37 months of the project, {{there was no significant}} impact on either attendances at Accident & Emergency departments (RR = 1. 02; 95 % CI 0. 97 – 1. 06) or emergency admissions of elderly patients (RR = 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 93 – 1. 05). Conclusion: the KWAH Project has been ineffective in reducing emergency admissions among the elderly. Significant questions arise in relation to selection of the screening instruments, practicality of achieving higher coverage of the eligible population, and creation of a new postcode lottery...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Quality)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 The Catalytic Converter Industry (CCI), forms {{part of the}} {{component}} supply chain in the motor industry. The CCI {{is made up of}} a plethora of different suppliers, however {{for the purpose of this}} study, the focus will be on three of the five main suppliers, namely the ‘monolith substrate manufacturers’, the ‘coaters’, and the ‘canners’. The latter suppliers supply directly to the car manufacturers, also commonly referred to as the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and are known as first tier suppliers. Some OEM’s exercise control over the entire supply chain. The control is exercised through various ‘customer requirements’ and ‘customer specific requirements’. Customer specific requirements influence the Quality Management System (QMS) of a supplier. Most OEM’s require that strategic suppliers must be ISO/TS 16949 : 2002 certified. ISO/TS 16949 : 2002 refers to an internationally recognised specification, specifically adopted for the motor industry, and dictates the certification requirements that an organisation’s QMS must adhere to. The specification also makes provision for additional requirements that could be specified by the customer. In this instance, the customer is the OEM, in terms <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>additional</b> requirements can be specified over and above the certification requirements. For organisations manufacturing generic components for the various motor manufacturers, customer specific requirements add to the complexity of activities related to quality management systems. Applying an array of methods to minimise the risk of sending defective products to the customer by building each customer’s specific requirements into the quality management system, can lead to confusion and make work difficult to execute. To mitigate the complexity, the quality management systems should be simplified to ensure that the quality management system is entrenched and adds value to the organisations’ activities...|$|E
