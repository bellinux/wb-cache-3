5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Shadow suffers from amnesia. Other than the events of Sonic Heroes that took place three months prior, Shadow remembers only two things: his name and his attempt to escape the space colony ARK with his creator's granddaughter Maria, who was killed by G.U.N. soldiers. Having walked through a room filled with androids that looked like him during the events of Sonic Heroes, Shadow wonders if he too is an android. The game starts with Shadow reminiscing outside the city of Westopolis when the alien race Black Arms drops out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> invades the city. One Black Arms alien, Doom's Eye, approaches Shadow, and the Black Arms's leader Black Doom tells Shadow of an old agreement Shadow made: to bring Black Doom the Chaos Emeralds. Stunned that Black Doom knew his name, Shadow searches for the Chaos Emeralds to learn about his past.|$|E

25|$|Ukko's origins are {{probably}} in Baltic Perkons {{and the older}} Finnish sky god Ilmarinen. Also Thor is related to Perkons. While Ukko took Ilmarinen's position as the Sky God, Ilmarinen's destiny was {{to turn into a}} smith-hero, or the god of the rock. In the epic poetry of the Kalevala, Ilmarinen is credited with forging the stars on the dome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> the magic mill of plenty, the Sampo.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Gondwanaland's Wide Skies was {{released}} and even long time {{followers of the}} band were surprised at the progression of Carolan's compositions. Gone were the earthy good time romps and quiet moments of reflection. Now complex panoramic chord clusters enveloped the arrangements in an almost overwhelming evocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> all that happens in and under it. This album's multi-layered textures and moods earned the band even greater critical respect.|$|E

25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> the nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude 5.5 is barely {{visible to the naked eye}} even under ideal conditions. That will change from the 80th to the 90th centuries, however, when the south celestial pole travels through the False Cross.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{air shower}} (EAS) arrays, a second {{detection}} method, measure the charged particles which pass through them. EAS arrays measure much higher-energy cosmic rays than air Cherenkov telescopes, and can observe a broad area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> can be active about 90% of the time. However, {{they are less}} able to segregate background effects from cosmic rays than can air Cherenkov telescopes. EAS arrays employ plastic scintillators in order to detect particles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the typical}} form of her myth, Isis {{was the first}} {{daughter}} of Geb, god of the Earth, and Nut, goddess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky,</b> <b>and</b> she was {{born on the fourth}} intercalary day. She married her brother, Osiris, and she conceived Horus with him. Isis was instrumental in the resurrection of Osiris when he was murdered by Set. Using her magical skills, she restored his body to life after having gathered the body parts that had been strewn about the earth by Set.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} source (Taagepera), {{traditional}} Udmurt Vos theory follows similar {{patterns of the}} Mari one, but {{in contrast to the}} Mari, female deities dominate. In-Mumy (Heavens Mother), Shundy-Mumy (Sun Mother) and (Gudyry-Mumy) are the head deities. Male deities of the air sphere are Inmar (god <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> air), Töl-Peri (wind) and Kwaz (weather). Earthly and chthonic gods are mostly males, among which Nulesmurt (forest man), Kyldysin (fertility and procreation), Invu (waters), Vorshud (genius of the kins and genius loci).|$|E
25|$|While the two nudes {{are treated}} with rather natural colors, {{the rest of the}} canvas appears treated with more {{artificial}} tints, tones, hues and shades. Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck or Kees van Dongen, Metzinger's composition is strongly Cézannian. The vertical format and light colors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> treatment of foreground and background elements create a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of Georges Seurat, or Paul Cézanne's 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence. However, the brushstrokes and overall appearance are not at all Cézannian in nature.|$|E
25|$|The final canvas differs {{markedly}} from Thomson's spring 1916 sketch. He {{made the}} tree appear larger {{by lowering the}} hills {{on the far side}} of the lake. The weather had been stormy when Thomson made the sketch and the dark, rolling clouds were echoed in the heavy, swirling brushwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> the slate grey lake. In the final painting, Thomson has swapped the storm clouds for a clear twilight sky. The sky and lake are now highly stylized, painted in long horizontal brushstrokes that show, along with its nearly square format, the influence of Thomson's colleague Lawren Harris.|$|E

The Native American medicine men tricked the god, imprisoning him inside the totem pole. Sarah Jane suspects that Hetocumtek was an alien masquerading as a warrior god. However, a scan detects no alien signs of any kind.|$|R
