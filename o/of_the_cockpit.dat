5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E
5|$|A mockup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
50|$|By 2000s railway standards, E.636s {{were old}} and uncomfortable. <b>The</b> {{original}} design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> proved absolutely unfit to modern safety standards: this {{was shown in}} an accident in 1996 at Sulmona, where the engine driver died despite the low speed, {{without being able to}} leave <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> in time. 200 units were therefore rebuilt and stripped of all asbestos.|$|R

50|$|Both models {{also had}} flat sided, truss framed {{fuselage}}s, with rounded upper decking ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits.</b> Behind <b>the</b> G-26 <b>cockpit</b> <b>the</b> raised upper fuselage continued to the tail. As on the G-22, the fin and the fabric covered, unbalanced rudder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-26 together had an elliptic profile. Its tailplane was set well back, with its leading edge {{only a little}} ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rudder hinge line; the elevators were hinged behind the rudder.|$|R
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|On August 28, 2001, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri made {{reservations}} on American Airlines Flight 11, {{using the}} Mail Boxes Etc. in Hollywood, Florida as their address. The Shehri brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone {{to change their}} first-class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11, selecting seats {{on the side of}} the aircraft that offered a direct view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462.|$|E
5|$|S.E.5 no. A4850, {{fresh from}} its packing crate, was {{extensively}} modified for Ball: in particular {{he had the}} synchronised Vickers machine gun removed, to be replaced with a second Lewis gun fitted to fire downwards through the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> He also had a slightly larger fuel tank installed. On 9 April, A4850 was refitted, and the downward-firing Lewis gun removed and replaced by the normal Vickers gun mounting. In a letter to Flora Young on 18 April, Ball mentioned getting his own hut on the flight line, and installing {{the members of his}} flight nearby.|$|E
25|$|The Airco DH.9 was a {{single-engine}} British bomber aircraft, {{sharing a}} high level <b>of</b> similarities with <b>the</b> preceding DH.4. The standard flight surfaces were broadly the same, but adopted a highly redesigned fuselage configuration, including <b>the</b> repositioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot's <b>cockpit</b> to a more rearwards position. Structurally, the fuselage was similar to its predecessor; plywood cladding covered the forward fuselage, which had no internal bracing, while a conventional wire-braced box girder structure was used aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits.</b> Internal stowage {{for a pair of}} 230 lb or four 112 lb bombs was provided for, although there was little use of this capability operationally.|$|R

5|$|The Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics YF-22 was an American single-seat, {{twin-engine}} fighter aircraft {{technology demonstrator}} {{designed for the}} United States Air Force (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, and two prototypes were built for the demonstration/validation phase of the competition. The YF-22 won the contest against the Northrop YF-23, and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The YF-22 has similar aerodynamic layout and configuration as the F-22, but with differences in the position and design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> tail fins and wings, and in internal structural layout.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{responsibility for}} investigating the incident lay with the Air Accident Investigation Board/Norway (AAIB/N), although {{the investigation and}} report was a close cooperation with the Interstate Aviation Committee {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Federal Air Transport Agency. AAIB/N had the primary responsibility for investigations at the crash site, cooperation with the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, and writing the report. IAC was responsible for handling the investigations in Russia, the reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> voice recorder, the flight data recorder, the relationship with Vnukovo Airlines and a test flight. Both agencies agreed that English was to be the language of the final report; English is one of the ICAO languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with Mk. II's in May 1941 and Finucane {{was assigned}} serial P8038, formerly of No. 303 Squadron RAF, on 21 May. It {{was the first}} of four Spitfires to carry the Shamrock emblem as his personal insignia. Jimmy Firth, his airframe rigger and 'Speedy' Moore, a Canadian engine fitter, were attempting to put an outline of the design on. Poorly done, it attracted the attention of Maurice Pownhall a professional in Lithography. Using green dope he completed the emblem on the forward left part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> fairing panel. Finucane approved and the Shamrock stayed.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} with many parasol designs where the pilot sits {{directly}} underneath the wing on <b>the</b> aircraft's center <b>of</b> gravity, <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> access is restricted by <b>the</b> close proximity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing.|$|R

5|$|Westland also {{manufactured}} SAR {{versions of}} the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E
5|$|Early F-16s {{could be}} armed {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside the fuselage to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E

5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one on each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
5|$|In 2020, the Jaeger Gipsy Danger, piloted by {{brothers}} Raleigh and Yancy Beckett, defends Anchorage {{from the}} Kaiju Knifehead. They both engage in combat, with Gipsy gaining {{the upper hand}} and defeating the Kaiju by blasting it with its plasma cannon. Unknown to them, the Kaiju is still alive. Knifehead then reemerges, ambushes them, critically damages Gipsy Danger by severing its left arm and throws Yancy out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> killing him. Raleigh manages to pilot Gipsy alone, activating the remaining plasma cannon and finally killing Knifehead. Traumatized by Yancy’s death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program. In 2025, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers, in favor of building massive coastal walls, but the Kaiju are growing more powerful, their attacks more frequent and Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they are built. The remaining four Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong {{under the command of}} Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying The Breach using a nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. MacLachlan's {{squadron}} {{moved to}} France on 2 September, and Britain and her allies declared war the following day. 88 Squadron formed {{part of the}} RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) commanded by Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair. On 12 September 1939 88 Squadron was based southeast of Rheims. At this time the Luftwaffe was heavily engaged in Poland {{and only a few}} small-scale skirmishes were fought with a thin German fighter screen left to guard western Germany against a French attack. On 20 September elements of the squadron were intercepted by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) over the border. Four Fairey Battle aircraft were shot down. On 30 September 150 Squadron lost five Battles on unescorted missions into German airspace. It quickly became clear to the crews that the Battle was too slow and too poorly armed to defend itself and operations were shut down. The squadron took measures to increase its defensive power by adding a third machine gun in the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> for the observer to use.|$|E

5|$|The L version {{would not}} be able to enter {{production}} with the DB 600 owing to its use in the Bf 109, and the Bramo engine was rather thirsty on fuel and left the M models with too short a range for reconnaissance use. BMW 132N radials of 865PS were selected instead, which had lower fuel consumption for better range. Another two prototypes with DB 600 engines were produced as the Do 17R-0, but did not enter production. During reconnaissance missions the P-1 was armed with four MG 15s in the A, B and C—Stands. One machine gun was located in the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> another in the lower rear Bola mount, one facing forward through the windscreen and the other in the nose glazing. In earlier variants the B-Stand (the gun position in the upper rear cockpit) was open to the elements, but the P-1 now provided an enclosed bulb-shaped mount protecting the radio operator from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's {{construction}} was a novelty for the time. In {{contrast to the}} monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă's description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by The Technical World magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate {{that it had a}} wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces {{at the rear of the}} tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.|$|E
