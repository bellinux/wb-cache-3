When hearing loss is a result <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes below the level <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E

5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining. The injury itself meant there would, in fact, be two minutes and 39 seconds <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a challenge by Nicol and raced into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E
