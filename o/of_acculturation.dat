Method: Using data from 675 Korean American elders (mean age = 70. 2, SD = 6. 87), the study estimates hierarchical linear or logistic regression models. Results: Greater knowledge of AD is predicted by higher levels <b>of</b> education and <b>acculturation.</b> Feelings <b>of</b> shame associated with family members having AD {{are more likely to}} be reported by individuals with lower levels <b>of</b> education, <b>acculturation,</b> and knowledge <b>of</b> AD.

25|$|However, another view, {{probably}} the most widely held today, is that the migrants were relatively few, centred on a warrior elite. They then dominated a process <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> to their own language and material culture. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land-use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry {{of the people of}} Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies tend to support this prediction.|$|E

Such acculturation process was also reflected by assimilation of immigrants from other part of Maritime Southeast Asia, commonly known as anak dagang ('traders'), into the established Malay communities, aided by similarity in lifestyle and common religion (Islam). Among these immigrant communities, some cultural elements of Malay origin were later combined in various forms and degrees with their own elements, which partly retained.

25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, {{there is a growing}} recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, American and European {{trade and}} {{settlement}} initially {{led to the}} growth of totem pole carving, but United States and Canadian policies and practices <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> and assimilation caused a decline in the development of Alaska Native and First Nations cultures and their crafts, and sharply reduced totem pole production {{by the end of the}} century. Between 1830 and 1880, the maritime fur trade, mining, and fisheries gave rise to an accumulation of wealth among the coastal peoples. Much of it was spent and distributed in lavish potlatch celebrations, frequently associated with the construction and erection of totem poles. The monumental poles commissioned by wealthy family leaders to represent their social status and the importance of their families and clans. In the 1880s and 1890s, tourists, collectors, scientists and naturalist interested in native culture collected and photographed totem poles and other artifacts, many of which were put on display at expositions such as the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the 1893 World's Columbia Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{resistance}} was sporadic, yet at times fierce, but was largely crushed by 1902, although relatively minor rebellions occurred in subsequent years, including the Ta-pa-ni incident of 1915 in Tainan county. Nonviolent means of resistance {{began to take}} place of armed rebellions and the most prominent organization was the Taiwanese Cultural Association, founded in 1921. Taiwanese {{resistance was}} caused by several different factors (e.g., the Taishō Democracy). Some were goaded by Chinese nationalism, while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination. Rebellions were often caused {{by a combination of}} the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant millenarian beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> and pacification lasted up until the early 1930s. The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the Musha Uprising (Wushe Uprising) in late 1930 by the Atayal people angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of camphor extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school. The uprising, led by Mona Rudao, was crushed by 2,000-3,000 Japanese troops and Aboriginal auxiliaries with the help of poison gas.|$|E
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Indications <b>of</b> immigrants' <b>acculturation</b> {{strategies}} are {{largely based on}} scaled responses obtained from surveys, interviews and focus groups. However, in anthropology it is a truism that {{there is often a}} difference between what people say and what they do. In my research I used direct observation of public social encounters in a small Midwestern community with a large meat processing facility, to ascertain what acculturation strategy or {{strategies are}} most prevalent among newcomers who are mostly Latino immigrants. While multiple acculturation strategies were observed, the <b>acculturation</b> strategy <b>of</b> separation predominated, although a significant degree <b>of</b> the <b>acculturation</b> orientation <b>of</b> integration was observed as well.

40|$|Over {{the past}} fifteen years, the {{bilingualism}} or language <b>acculturation</b> <b>of</b> the ‘new’ second generation has received increasing attention in the literature. Child bilingualism is viewed as an intervening variable {{in the relationship between}} immigrant background factors and the future socioeconomic assimilation of second generation children. Missing from this conversation though is the possibility that language acculturation is not a process occurring only among immigrant children; it can occur among families. I fill this gap by first providing a conceptual framework for understanding how acculturation can occur among families and then producing a blueprint for measuring familial acculturation. I then determine which child and parental factors affect familial acculturation. Three results surface from multivariate analyses. First, by far, parental skills and resources, as well as child tenure in the U. S. are the strongest and most consistent determinants <b>of</b> familial <b>acculturation.</b> Second, {{there is no evidence that}} the process <b>of</b> familial <b>acculturation</b> differs by sex. Third, parental modes of incorporation do not moderate the effects of parental skills and resources. Together, these findings and the measurement blueprint presented encourage further consideration <b>of</b> how familial <b>acculturation</b> within immigrant families contributes to the entire process of second generation socioeconomic assimilation...|$|R

25|$|While Orthodox protests to Jacobson's {{initiatives}} were scant, {{dozens of}} rabbis throughout Europe united {{to ban the}} Hamburg Temple. Its leaders attempted to justify themselves based on canonical sources, being still attached to old modes of thought. They had the grudging support of one rabbi, Aaron Chorin of Arad (and even he never acceded to the abrogation of the Messianic doctrine). The massive Orthodox reaction halted the advance of the new trend, confining it to the port city for the next twenty years. Although many synagogues introduced mild aesthetic modifications as the process <b>of</b> <b>acculturation</b> spread throughout Central Europe, synchronized with the breakdown of traditional society and growing religious laxity, those were carefully crafted in order to assuage conservative elements – albeit the latter often opposed them anyhow; vernacular sermons or secular education for rabbis were much resisted – and lacked a serious ideological undertone. One {{of the first to}} adopt such was Hamburg's own Orthodox community under the newly appointed Rabbi Isaac Bernays. The far less strict but still traditional Isaac Noah Mannheimer of the Vienna Stadttempel and Michael Sachs in Prague, who both significantly altered custom but wholly avoided dogmatic issues or overt injury to Jewish Law, set the pace for most of Europe.|$|E

This [...] "evangelicalization of the Assemblies of God" [...] has led to the weakening of Pentecostal distinctives, especially the doctrine of initial evidence.

The removal or replacement of these brought about an incremental transformation from [...] "Fan" [...] (barbarian) to the dominant Confucian [...] "Han" [...] culture.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to observe how female defectors from North Korea acculturate in South Korean {{clothing}} culture and to discuss possible policies to help their cultural settlement. North Korean defectors can experience culture shock and feel much pressure to adopt new lifestyle in terms of South Korean mode of fashion. Therefore, this research examines cultural points where NK female defectors recognize differences between two clothing cultures. To this end, in-depth interview was conducted with 11 participants. Researchers observed three types <b>of</b> clothing <b>acculturation</b> and drew a paradigm model that depicts the phenomenon <b>of</b> clothing <b>acculturation</b> <b>of</b> North Korean female defectors. Lastly, this study discussed about three possible policy suggestions based on the observed acculturation strategies by acculturation types. This study involves academic implications for investigating clothing acculturation by an immigrant group in a new society in a broad sense. There is a limit on this research that there can be some biased responses from participants because of the uniqueness of the group.|$|R
500|$|Beginning {{nearly a}} century later, as {{the rule of the}} Qing Empire {{expanded}} over wider groups of people, writers and gazetteers recast their descriptions away from reflecting degree <b>of</b> <b>acculturation,</b> and toward a system that defined the aborigines relative to their submission or hostility to Qing rule. Qing used the term [...] "raw/wild/uncivilized" [...] (...) to define those people who had not submitted to Qing rule, and [...] "cooked/tamed/civilized" [...] (...) for those who had pledged their allegiance through their payment of a head tax. According to the standards of the Qianlong Emperor and successive regimes, the epithet [...] "cooked" [...] was synonymous with having assimilated to Han cultural norms, and living as a subject of the Empire, but it retained a pejorative designation to signify the perceived cultural lacking of the non-Han people. This designation reflected the prevailing idea that anyone could be civilized/tamed by adopting Confucian social norms.|$|E

2500|$|This 'heroic tradition' of conquering incomers is {{consistent}} with the conviction of Bede, and later Anglo-Saxon historians, that the ancestral origin of the English was not the result of any assimilation with the native British, but was derived solely from the Germanic migrants of the post-Roman period.
