40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that elevated {{body mass index}} (BMI) is associated with reduced survival for women with breast cancer. However, the underlying reasons remain unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate a possible causal role of BMI in survival from breast cancer. We used individual-level data from six large breast cancer case-cohorts including a total of 36 210 individuals (2475 events) of European ancestry. We created a BMI genetic risk score (GRS) based on genotypes at 94 known BMI-associated genetic variants. Association between the BMI genetic score and breast cancer survival was analysed by Cox regression for each study separately. Study-specific hazard ratios were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. BMI genetic score {{was found to be}} associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival for estrogen receptor (ER) -positive cases [hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 11, per <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment</b> of GRS, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 01 - 1. 22, P = 0. 03). We observed no association for ER-negative cases (HR = 1. 00, per <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment</b> of GRS, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 1. 13,P = 0. 95). Our findings suggest a causal effect of increased BMI on reduced breast cancer survival for ER-positive breast cancer. There is no evidence of a causal effect of higher BMI on survival for ER-negative breast cancer cases...|$|E
30|$|First, in {{the case}} of large firms, {{internal}} R&D activities are valid at the level of p[*]<[*]. 01, and external R&D activities are valid at the level of p[*]<[*]. 05 based on the result of Wald test. An increase of one unit (X 1, β[*]=[*] 2.093) in the internal R&D activities is linked to an 8.106 -fold increase in the odds ratio, which refers to the probability of product innovation versus no product innovation (1 -p (Y)). A one-unit increase in external R&D activities (X 3, β[*]=[*] 2.643) leads to a 14.052 -fold increase in the odds ratio. Thus, it is found that a one-unit increase in external R&D has a more significant effect on product innovation than does a <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment</b> in internal R&D.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} exposure-response {{relationships of}} AMG 386 in a phase 2 study in advanced ovarian cancer for the facilitation of dose selection in future studies. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model of AMG 386 (N =  141) {{was developed and}} applied in an exposure-response analysis using data from patients (N =  160) with recurrent ovarian cancer who received paclitaxel plus AMG 386 (3 or 10  mg/kg once weekly) or placebo. Reduction {{in the risk of}} progression or death with increasing exposure (steady-state area under the concentration-versus-time curve [AUC(ss) ]) was assessed using Cox regression analyses. Confounding factors were tested in multivariate analysis. Alternative AMG 386 doses were explored with Monte Carlo simulations using population pharmacokinetic and parametric survival models. RESULTS: There was a trend toward increased PFS with increased AUC(ss) (hazard ratio [HR] for each <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment</b> in AUC(ss), 0. 97; P =  0. 097), suggesting that the maximum effect on prolonging PFS was not achieved at the highest dose tested (10  mg/kg).

40|$|Background Risk {{factors for}} medical errors remain poorly understood. We {{performed}} a case–control study of retained foreign bodies in surgical patients {{in order to}} identify risk factors for this type of error. Methods We reviewed the medical records associated with all claims or incident reports of a retained surgical sponge or instrument filed between 1985 and 2001 with a large malpractice insurer representing one third of the physicians in Massachusetts. For each case, we identified an average of four randomly selected controls who underwent the same type of operation during the same six-month period. Results Our study included 54 patients with a total of 61 retained foreign bodies (of which 69 percent were sponges and 31 percent instruments) and 235 control patients. Thirty-seven of the patients with retained foreign bodies (69 percent) required reoperation, and one died. Patients with retained foreign bodies were more likely than controls to have had emergency surgery (33 percent vs. 7 percent, P< 0. 001) or an unexpected change in surgical procedure (34 percent vs. 9 percent, P< 0. 001). Patients with retained foreign bodies also had a higher mean body-mass index and were less likely to have had counts of sponges and instruments performed. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with a significantly increased risk of retention of a foreign body were emergency surgery (risk ratio, 8. 8 [95 percent confidence interval, 2. 4 to 31. 9]), unplanned change in the operation (risk ratio, 4. 1 [95 percent confidence interval, 1. 4 to 12. 4]), and body-mass index (risk ratio for each <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment,</b> 1. 1 [95 percent confidenc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Exercise {{tolerance}} {{in patients}} with diabetes is frequently impaired due to noncardiac disease such as claudication and polyneuropathy. This study assesses the prognostic value of dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging {{in patients with}} diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 207 consecutive diabetic patients who were unable to undergo exercise stress testing underwent dobutamine-atropine stress myocardial perfusion imaging. Follow-up was successful in 206 of 207 (99. 5 %) patients. A total of 12 patients underwent early (< 60 days) revascularization and {{were excluded from the}} analysis. End points during follow-up were hard cardiac events, defined as cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Abnormal myocardial perfusion was detected in 125 (64 %) patients. During 4. 1 +/- 2. 4 years of follow-up, 73 (38 %) deaths occurred, 36 (49 %) of which were due to cardiac causes. Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 7 (4 %) patients, and 45 (23 %) patients underwent late coronary revascularization. Cardiac death occurred in 2 of 69 (3 %) patients with normal myocardial perfusion and in 34 of 125 (27 %) patients with perfusion abnormalities (P < 0. 0001). A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that, in addition to clinical and stress test data, an abnormal scan had an incremental prognostic value for prediction of cardiac death (hazard ratio 7. 2, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 30). The summed stress score was an important predictor of cardiac death; the hazard ratio was 1. 2 (95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 34) per <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Dobutamine-atropine stress myocardial perfusion imaging provides additional prognostic information incremental to clinical data in patients with diabetes who are unable to undergo exercise stress testing...|$|E

40|$|Background: The risk of {{developing}} coronary heart disease differs by sex, and accumulating evidence suggests that sex differences exist in the effect of coronary risk factors on vascular risk. So far, {{the existence of a}} sex difference in the association between BMI and coronary heart disease has not been systematically studied. Since sexual dimorphisms in body composition exist, we postulated that the association between BMI and coronary heart disease would differ between women and men. Methods: We did systematic searches of PubMed and Embase up to Feb 20, 2015, for studies of the longitudinal association between BMI and coronary heart disease in women and men from population-based cohorts. We excluded studies if they contained duplicate data from the same study, reported estimates only for Z scores or percentiles of BMI, did not report estimate uncertainty, did not report sex-specific estimates, recruited mainly individuals with a previous history of cardiovascular disease or from within selected populations, and those for which the full text was not available in English. We also included individual participant data from four large studies. Study results were pooled using random-effect models with inverse variance weighting. Our predefined primary endpoint was the pooled women-to-men ratio of the age-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), or equivalent, relating (continuous and categorical) BMI to coronary heart disease. Findings: We reviewed a total of 8561 original entries twice for inclusion in the analysis, of which 32 published studies were eligible for inclusion. Data from 95 cohorts, 1 219 187 participants, and 37 488 incident cases of coronary heart disease were included. Higher BMI was significantly associated with age-adjusted coronary heart disease: for a one-unit (kg/m) increment in BMI; the HR was 1 · 04 (95 % CI 1 · 03 - 1 · 05) in women and 1 · 05 (1 · 04 - 1 · 07) in men. Compared with people of a normal weight, the age-adjusted HR of coronary heart disease for the underweight group was 1 · 25 (1 · 05 - 1 · 49) in women and 1 · 09 (0 · 91 - 1 · 23) in men; for the overweight group 1 · 20 (1 · 12 - 1 · 29) in women and 1 · 22 (1 · 12 - 1 · 32) in men; and for the obese group 1 · 61 (1 · 42 - 1 · 82) in women and 1 · 60 (1 · 43 - 1 · 79) in men. Overall, these associations did not differ between the sexes. The women-to-men ratios of the HRs were 0 · 99 (95 % CI 0 · 98 - 1 · 00) for a <b>one-unit</b> <b>increment</b> in BMI, 1 · 10 (0 · 91 - 1 · 32) for the underweight group, 0 · 99 (0 · 92 - 1 · 07) for the overweight group, and 1 · 06 (0 · 95 - 1 · 17) for the obese group, relative to the normal weight group. Similar results were obtained after multiple adjustment and in a range of sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: Increased BMI, measured either continuously or categorically, has the same deleterious effects on the risk of coronary heart disease in women and men across diverse populations...|$|E
