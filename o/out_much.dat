5|$|All of the {{historical}} coastal Asian groups were driven to near-extinction in short order by Japanese industrial hunts. Those groups that once migrated along western Japan to the East China Sea were likely wiped <b>out</b> <b>much</b> earlier, as the last catches on Amami Oshima were between the 1910s and the 1930s, and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago, excluding the Ryukyu Islands, were over a half-century ago. Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the full}} moon of April 9, while Ikutsuki, Mitsuru and Yukari are observing Makoto during the midnight phenomenon, Akihiko Sanada (Hikaru Midorikawa) rushes back to the dorm just as it comes under the attack of a swarm of monstrous creatures. Yukari {{immediately}} grabs Makoto and flees to the roof. However they are cornered by a giant creature who knocks Yukari <b>out.</b> <b>Much</b> to everyone's amazement though, Makoto awakens {{to the power of}} Persona, calling forth Orpheus. However another Persona known as Thanatos, rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine was codified in the 20th {{century by}} Auguste Escoffier {{to become the}} modern haute cuisine; Escoffier, however, left <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the local culinary {{character}} {{to be found in}} the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.|$|E

5|$|Before Crichton's {{novel was}} published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. With {{the backing of}} Universal Studios, Spielberg {{acquired}} the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990; Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii between August and November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed Schindler's List. The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested {{in the creation of}} DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{with the}} end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its {{inception}} in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying <b>out</b> <b>much</b> the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Vols {{returned}} home and resumed their SEC schedule against in-state foe Vanderbilt, who was {{ranked in the}} top 10. Throughout the first half, the game was about even, until the Lady Vols got a slight lead with under seven minutes left, which they took to the locker room, 37–31. The second half, however, started <b>out</b> <b>much</b> differently, beginning with a 20–0 Lady Vols run. Tennessee led by as many as 35 points in the game, and ended the game with an 86–54 win. Catchings was named the SEC Player of the Week for her role in the DePaul and Vanderbilt games, scoring 35 and 22 points respectively. The final game of the month was the rematch with Georgia. It ended up being a blowout. Tennessee shot better than 60%, and Holdsclaw scored more points in the first half than the entire Georgia team. Tennessee broke the 20-steal mark, as well as the 100-point mark, winning 102–43.|$|E

5|$|The plank {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge {{was the only}} one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90foot (27m) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.|$|E
5|$|The team's first intra-squad {{scrimmage}} showcased Pitino's fast-paced, three-point-heavy style; the {{two teams}} combined to shoot 98-of-175 from the field, including 23-of-57 from three, as the Blue team defeated the White team 14585. Farmer led the White team (the projected reserves) in scoring with 26 points, including 5-of-13 shooting from three-point range. In the next scrimmage, played at Farmer's alma mater, Clay County High School, Farmer scored 32 points, but the White team lost to the Blue team again, 125117. The teams again combined for 175 shots, and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points. Farmer sat <b>out</b> <b>much</b> {{of the second half}} of the final scrimmage due to illness but scored 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a 124120 victory for the White team.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{was first}} {{performed}} on 13 June 1997 at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall during the 50th Aldeburgh Festival. Sally Burgess {{was accompanied by}} the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by Nicholas Kok. The companion piece was the chamber opera The Country of the Blind which Turnage had composed relatively quickly {{in order to make}} up a full programme after Twice had turned <b>out</b> <b>much</b> shorter than originally intended. To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with a staging at its main home in the London Coliseum. This production was premiered on 20 October 1997 with Susan Bickley as the soloist and with Kok again conducting. In this context it was a companion piece for From the House of the Dead, an opera set in a Siberian prison camp.|$|E

5|$|Aerosmith {{commenced}} {{recording a}} new album on Armed Forces Day 2006. Tyler and Perry performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra for their annual concert of July 4 on the Esplanade in 2006, a milestone {{as it was the}} first major event or performance since Steven Tyler's throat surgery. Around this time, the band also announced that they would embark on the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in late 2006. On August 24, 2006 it was announced that Tom Hamilton was undergoing treatment for throat cancer. In order to make a full recovery, he sat <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the Route of All Evil Tour until he was well again. Former Joe Perry Project bassist David Hull substituted for Hamilton until his return. On September 5, 2006, Aerosmith kicked off the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in Columbus, Ohio. The co-headlining tour took both bands to amphitheaters across North America through November 24. After that, a select few arena dates were added, some of which were with Mötley Crüe. The tour ended December 17.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 12 June {{the entire}} 3rd Parachute Brigade {{position}} came under artillery and mortar fire {{prior to a}} major attack scheduled to start at 15:00. A German battalion attacked the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, another supported by six tanks and self-propelled guns attacked the 9th Parachute Battalion and the 5th Black Watch. The battle for the Château cost the Black Watch nine Bren Gun Carriers and destroyed all of their anti-tank guns. Unable to resist {{they were forced to}} pull back to the Bois de Mont, joining the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was being attacked by the German armoured vehicles. One tank in front of 'B' Company was hit by two PIAT rounds, but remained in action. The tank destroyed two of 'B' company's machine-gun posts, when it was hit by a third anti-tank projectile and withdrew. The attack killed or wounded the last men in the Machine-Gun Platoon and the Anti-Tank Platoon was reduced to one PIAT detachment. The German infantry were in danger of over-running the battalion, when Otway contacted brigade headquarters, informing them they were not able to hold <b>out</b> <b>much</b> longer. Brigadier James Hill personally led a counter-attack of forty men from the Canadian battalion which drove off the Germans. By 20:00 the area defended by the two battalions had been cleared of all opposition and the front line restored.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cypress}} domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the sunlight, {{plants such as}} orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his seventh}} {{season with the}} Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the Giants in December 2006. At the time, {{it was the largest}} {{contract}} ever given to a pitcher. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a national non-profit that provides comforts of home and lifts the spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched.

5|$|Temple Owls {{started their}} {{season with a}} 62–56 home win against Seton Hall Pirates on November 12. Seton Hall last led with 8:15 in the first half, off a Herb Pope jump shot to make the score 20–17. The Owls went on a 17–0 run to close the half. They led by up to 16 with 4 minutes and 16seconds left in the game, but Seton Hall scored the next 12 points to cut their deficit to four. Despite {{retaining}} most of their players from the 2009-2010 season, when they were the eighth-highest scoring team in Division I at 80.1 points per game, Seton Hall was held to 30 percent shooting by Temple Owls' defense. Juan Fernandez led Temple Owls with 12 points, and Rahlir Jefferson recorded his first double-double at 10 points and 10 rebounds. Owls player Lavoy Allen sat <b>out</b> <b>much</b> of the game with foul trouble. The Owls won their next game against Toledo 82–49.
