40|$|Abstract — The {{aggregate}} capacity of wireless mesh networks {{can be increased}} {{by the use of}} multiple frequency channels and multiple network interface cards in each router. Recent results have shown that the performance can further be increased when both non-overlapped and partially <b>overlapped</b> <b>channels</b> are being used. In this paper, we propose a linear model for a joint channel assignment, interface assignment, and scheduling design. We propose the <b>channel</b> <b>overlapping</b> matrix and mutual interference matrices to model the non-overlapped and partially <b>overlapped</b> <b>channels.</b> Since the model is formulated as a linear mixedinteger program with a few integer variables, the computation complexity is low and it is feasible for implementation.

40|$|Many {{wireless}} {{channels in}} different technologies {{are known to}} have partial overlap. However, due to the interference effects among such partially <b>overlapped</b> <b>channels,</b> their simultaneous use has typically been avoided. In this paper, we present a first attempt to model partial <b>overlap</b> between <b>channels</b> in a systematic manner. Through the model, we illustrate that the use of partially <b>overlapped</b> <b>channels</b> is not always harmful. In fact, a careful use of some partially <b>overlapped</b> <b>channels</b> can often lead to significant improvements in spectrum utilization and application performance. We demonstrate this through analysis as well as through detailed application-level and MAC-level measurements. Additionally, we illustrate the benefits of our developed model by using it to directly enhance the performance of two previously proposed channel assignment algorithms — one in the context of wireless LANs and the other in the context of multi-hop wireless mesh networks. Through detailed simulations, we show that use of partially <b>overlapped</b> <b>channels</b> in both these cases can improve end-to-end application throughput by factors between 1. 6 and 2. 7 in different scenarios, depending on wireless node density. We conclude by observing that the notion of partial overlap can be the right model of flexibility to design efficient channel access mechanisms in the emerging software radio platforms...|$|R
