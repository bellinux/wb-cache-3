40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Demand form micro-coordinate {{measuring}} machines (micro-CMMs) within industry is increasing {{due to the}} need for accurate measurement of the geometry of small-scale objects. Optical micro-CMMs have the advantage over traditional stylus-based CMMs of being non-contact instruments, and have the ability to acquire large amounts of data, with high resolution, in {{a relatively short period of}} time. The focus variation (FV) technique is typically used in the field of surface topography measurement, but has the potential to be implemented as a sensor technology for optical micro-CMMs. Exploring the possibility of the FV technique as an optical micro-CMM requires that the <b>instrument</b> and <b>measuring</b> procedure can be performance verified. Consequently, a prototype FV based optical micro-CMM should have a verification route that is traceable to the definition of the metre. The ISO 10360 specification standard for acceptance testing and verification of CMMs has several parts, all specific to different groups of instruments and configurations. Each section of ISO 10360 identifies methods and artefacts best suited for the acceptance testing and verification of each group and configuration. ISO/DIS 10360 - 8. 2 (due for ISO/FDIS publication in 2013), is a verification standard written for CMMs with <b>optical</b> <b>distance</b> sensors. There are four main parts to the acceptance and re-verification tests: length measurement error, probing form error measurement, probing size error measurement and flat form error measurement. The probing form and size error tests require a calibrated reference sphere that has a diameter of at least 10 mm. FV instruments are potentially covered by this standard but the recommended minimum size of the calibration sphere is too large to fully fit within one field of view of a typical FV <b>instrument</b> [...] <b>Optical</b> <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> similar in operation to FV systems, such as confocal microscopes and coherent scanning interferometers are, therefore, also currently excluded from the application of this standard by default, unless the user, and the instrument manufacturer, can potentially agree to use a smaller calibrated reference sphere for the assessment of the probing size and form error. A prototype FV based optical micro-CMM should, therefore, be verified with calibrated reference spheres of similar size to objects for which the technique has been designed to measure. The research reported here considers the use of 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm diameter reference spheres as suitable components for a reference artefact, with the surfaces of the spheres roughened using bespoke micro-roughening techniques. The research presents a novel verification artefact composed of multiple small-scale spheres, specifically designed to evaluate probing size error, probe form error, and dimensional accuracy of a prototype FV based optical micro-CMM, compliant to ISO/DIS 10360 - 8. The results suggest that the artefacts and procedures detailed in ISO/DIS 10360 - 8 can, and should, be applied to optical micro-CMMs...|$|R

Our system robustly detects impor-tant rail components including ties, tie plates, anchors with high accuracy and efficiency.

40|$|As {{discussed}} in {{the first chapter of}} this book, there are many different methods to measure a part using optical technology. Chapter 2 discussed the use of machine vision to measure macroscopic features such as length and position, which was extended to the use of interferometry as a linear measurement tool in chapter 3, and laser or other trackers to find the relation of key points on large parts in chapter 4. This chapter looks at measuring large parts to optical tolerances in the sub-micron range using interferometry, ranging, and optical tools {{discussed in}} the previous chapters. The purpose of this chapter is not to discuss specific metrology tools (such as interferometers or gauges), but to describe a systems engineering approach to testing large parts. Issues such as material warpage and temperature drifts that may be insignificant when measuring a part to micron levels under a microscope, as will be discussed in later chapters, can prove to be very important when making the same measurement over a larger part. In this chapter, we will define a set of guiding principles for successfully overcoming these challenges and illustrate the application of these principles with real world examples. While these examples are drawn from specific large optical testing applications, they inform the problems associated with testing any large part to optical tolerances. Manufacturing today relies on micrometer level part performance. Fields such as energy and transportation are demanding higher tolerances to provide increased efficiencies and fuel savings. By looking at how the optics industry approaches sub-micrometer metrology, one can {{gain a better understanding of}} the metrology challenges for any larger part specified to micrometer tolerances. Testing large parts, whether optical components or precision structures, to optical tolerances is just like testing small parts, only harder. Identical with what one does for small parts, a metrologist tests large parts and optics in particular to quantify their mechanical properties (such as dimensions, mass, etc); their optical prescription or design (i. e. radius of curvature, conic constant, vertex location, size); and their full part shape. And, just as with small parts, a metrologist accomplishes these tests using <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> such as tape measures, inside micrometers, coordinate <b>measuring</b> machines, <b>distance</b> <b>measuring</b> interferometers; angle <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> such as theodolites, autocollimators; and surface <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> including interferometers, stylus profilers, interference microscopes, photogrammetric cameras, or other tools. However, while the methodology may be similar, it is more difficult to test a large object for the simple reason that most metrologists do not have the necessary intuition. The skills used to test small parts or optics in a laboratory do not extrapolate to testing large parts in an industrial setting any more than a backyard gardener might successfully operate a farm. But first, what is a large part? A simple definition might be the part's size or diameter. For optics and diffuse surface parts alike, the driving constraint is ability to illuminate the part's surface. For reflective convex mirrors, large is typically anything greater than 1 meter. But, for refractive optics, flats or convex mirrors, large is typically greater than 0. 5 meter. While a size definition is simple, it may be less than universal. A more nuanced definition might be that a large part is any component which cannot be easily tested in a standard laboratory environment, on a standard vibration isolated table using standard laboratory infrastructure. A micro-switch or a precision lens might be easily measured to nanometer levels under a microscope in a lab, but a power turbine spline or a larger telescope mirror will not fit under that microscope and may not even fit on the table...|$|R

This <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> is nonparametric, {{in contrast}} to common <b>distance</b> <b>measures</b> used in speaker segmentation systems, which often assume a Gaussian distribution when <b>measuring</b> the <b>distance</b> between 1 two audio segments. This <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> is essentially a k-nearestneighbor <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> Non-vowel segment removal in preprocessing stage is also proposed. Speaker segmentation performance is tested on artificially created conversations from the TIMIT database and two AMI conversations. For short window lengths, Missed Detection Rated is decreased significantly. For moderate window lengths, a decrease in both Missed Detection and False Alarm Rates occur. The computational cost of the <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> is high for long window lengths. Index Terms: speaker segmentation, <b>distance</b> <b>measure,</b> k-nearest-neighbo...|$|R

5000|$|Before EDM devices, <b>distances</b> were <b>measured</b> using {{a variety}} of means. These {{included}} chains with links of a known length such as a Gunter's chain, or measuring tapes made of steel or invar. To <b>measure</b> horizontal <b>distances,</b> these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to [...] "break" [...] (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. Perambulators, or measuring wheels, were used to <b>measure</b> longer <b>distances</b> but not to a high level of accuracy. Tacheometry is the science of <b>measuring</b> <b>distances</b> by <b>measuring</b> the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> for speaker clustering in speaker diarization systems. The proposed phonetic subspace mixture (PSM) model introduces phonetic {{information to the}} ΔBIC <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> Therefore, the new PSM model-based ΔBIC <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> can remove the effect of phonetic content on the diarization results. The typical ΔBIC <b>distance</b> <b>measure</b> {{can be seen as}} a special case of the new ΔBIC <b>distance</b> <b>measure.</b> Our experiment results show that the new distance measurement consistently improves the speaker diarization performance on three datasets.
