40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} usually {{perceived}} as an important transmission channel in the negative relationship between oil prices and economic performance. It may also constitute a short-term explanation of the non-linearity in this relationship, since Central Bankers may {{be more sensitive to}} the potential inflationary threats entailed by high oil price increases than to small increases or decreases. In this paper, we use an extended Taylor rule to investigate the role of oil prices in the ECB monetary policy strategy. A contemporaneous reaction function is estimated using both a GMM framework and an Ordered Probit model, and several <b>oil</b> <b>indicators</b> are constructed and tested. The main results suggest that oil prices {{play a key role in}} the ECB interest-rate setting, since it appears as a relevant indicator of future inflation. However, the ECB seems to react asymmetrically: only oil price increases influence its decision setting, not oil prices decreases. Monetary policy may thus transmit and amplify the asymmetry in the relationship between oil prices and activity in the euro area. Further investigations suggest that a preference for price stability provides an important explanation of this asymmetric behaviour of the ECB. ...|$|R

40|$|The power {{transformer}} {{is one of}} the most expensive components in an electrical transmission and distribution network. The temperature inside a {{power transformer}} varies with the load. The higher the operating temperature the faster the degradation of paperpress board insulation, consequently the remaining life of the transformer decreases. In order to keep the temperature under a safe limit, thermal models for predicting the hottest spot temperature in a transformer based on the load, cooling factors and ambient conditions have been developed and currently used in practice. In this project, a thermal model stipulated by the IEC standard is evaluated. The evaluation is carried out using the experimental results obtained at varying load current on a 40 MVAOFAF-cooled transformer equipped with both fibre-optic sensors and <b>oil</b> temperature <b>indicator,</b> and a 63 MVA-ONAF-cooled transformer equipped with <b>oil</b> temperature <b>indicator.</b> The model parameters are obtained from a normal heat-run test performed by the transformers manufacture. It can be shown that the response of the Difference equations method to the load variations is better than the Exponential method. A model Using Difference equations method and based on the internal cooling variations is proposed in this thesis. However, the calculated hot-spot temperature is not in a good agreement with the measured hot-spot temperature during rapid load increase. A proper result for the hot-spot temperature calculation using Difference equations method with ONAN cooling mode is obtained, although the cooling class of the transformer is OFAF. The calculated hot-spot temperature is compared to the measured hot-spot temperature to evaluate the model. The Difference equations method with ONAN cooling mode never underestimates the hot-spot temperature more than 3 ℃under a normal loading period. For the particular overloading situation the underestimation is 9. 9 % of the time period that is less accurate comparing to the normal loading period. The rate of occurrence of the underestimation is 7. 7 % for the Difference equations method with OFAF cooling mode during the normal loading situation and 13. 8 % during the overloading situation. However, the Difference equations method with OFAF cooling mode never underestimates the hotspot temperature more than 10 ℃ during the normal loading and overloading situations. Improvements are still required in order to predict the hot-spot temperature accurately using the Difference equations method under various dynamic loading conditions. Results indicate that the calculated top-oil temperatures are either underestimated or overestimated. For accurate hot-spot temperature calculations, it is hence recommended to use the measured top oil temperature...|$|R
40|$|Optimization of industrial-scale {{deodorization}} of high-oleic {{sunflower oil}} (HOSO) via response surface methodology {{is presented in}} this study. The results of an experimental program conducted on an industrial-scale deodorizer were analyzed statistically. Predictive models were derived {{for each of the}} <b>oil</b> quality <b>indicators</b> (QI) in dependence on the studied variable deodorization process parameters. The deodorization behavior of some minor components was analyzed on a pilot-scale deodorizer. For comparison, a similar experimental program was also performed on the laboratory-scale. The results of this study demonstrate that optimization of the deodorization process requires a suitable compromise between often mutually opposing demands dictated by different oil QI. The production of HOSO with top-quality organoleptic and nutritional values (high tocopherol and phytosterol contents and low free and trans fatty acid contents) and high oxidative stability demands deodorization temperatures in the range between 220 and 235 degrees C and a total sparge steam above 2. 0 % (wt/wt in oil). The response surface methodology provides the tools needed to identify the optimum deodorization process conditions.

40|$|Objectives: This {{analysis}} {{deals with}} the ecologic relationships of dietary fatty acids, food groups and the Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI, derived from 15 food groups) with 50 -year all-cause mortality rates in 16 cohorts of the Seven Countries Study. Material and methods: A dietary survey was conducted at baseline in cohorts subsamples including chemical analysis of food samples representing average consumptions. Ecologic correlations of dietary variables were computed across cohorts with 50 -year all-cause mortality rates, where 97 % of men had died. Results: There was a 12 -year average age at death population difference between extreme cohorts. In the 1960 s the average population intake of saturated (S) and trans (T) fatty acids and hard fats was high in the northern European cohorts while monounsaturated (M), polyunsaturated (P) fatty acids and vegetable oils were high in the Mediterranean areas and total fat was low in Japan. The 50 -year all-cause mortality rates correlated (r = - 0. 51 to - 0. 64) ecologically inversely with the ratios M/S, (M + P) /(S + T) and vegetable foods and the ratio hard fats/vegetable oils.
