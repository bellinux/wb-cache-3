5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage.

5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia and distinct {{in that it}} is the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage.

5|$|Populations <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species</b> have {{historically}} been included in Miniopterus manavi, but evidence published in 2008 and 2009 indicates that M. manavi is a complex of five separate species, including the newly described M.aelleni. M.aelleni {{has been found in}} forests and caves in karstic areas. Its distribution overlaps that of M.griveaudi, also formerly included in M.manavi.|$|E

5|$|Predation of sea otters does occur, {{although}} it is not common. Many predators find the otter, with their pungent scent glands, distasteful. Young predators may kill an otter and not eat it. Leading mammalian predators <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species</b> include orcas and sea lions; bald eagles also prey on pups by snatching them from the water surface.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx {{lived in}} what is now northeastern China during the early Cretaceous period.

5|$|Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, after {{collecting}} {{a specimen}} at Botany Bay in 1770 {{on the first}} voyage of Captain James Cook, {{was the first to}} write <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species.</b> He gave it the name Leucadendron apiifolium, but never officially described it. The specific epithet referred to the similarity of its leaves to Apium (celery).|$|E
50|$|Although the {{chestnut}}-headed oropendola shares much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species's</b> range, it is smaller, mainly {{black with}} a chestnut head (instead of mainly chestnut with a blackish head), and lacks coloured facial patches, {{so the two}} oropendolas {{are unlikely to be}} confused.|$|R

5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail is {{endemic to}} the Chittenango area of Madison County, New York, United States. There {{is only one}} {{population}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species</b> at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York, {{even though it was}} believed to have a broader range previously; based on fossil records, some authors argue that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species</b> may have been much wider in the past. In opposition to this, other authors argue {{that it is impossible to}} identify this species based on fossil records, because they only allow for examination of shell features. Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive.|$|E
5|$|The active {{constituents}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>species</b> are water-soluble, and boiling {{and then}} discarding the cooking water {{at least partly}} detoxifies A.muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E
