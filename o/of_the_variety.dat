5|$|A {{language}} {{which was}} the ancestor of Pochutec split from Proto-Nahuan (or Proto-Aztecan) possibly as early as AD 400, arriving in Mesoamerica a few centuries earlier than the main bulk of speakers of Nahuan languages. Some Nahuan groups migrated south along the Central American isthmus, reaching as far as Nicaragua. The critically endangered Pipil language of El Salvador is the only living descendant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> of Nahuatl once spoken south of present-day Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, largely because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> of species and habitats. The {{area around the}} pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids {{can be seen on}} the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
40|$|Grain quality {{characteristics}} of ten Beruin rice varieties were studied in <b>the</b> laboratory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grain Quality and Nutrition Division of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute and {{compared with a}} popular sticky local rice variety, Ranga Binni. Thousand paddy weights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tested <b>varieties</b> ranged between 14. 3 g to 25. 5 g. Milling out turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tested <b>varieties</b> were satisfactory compared to <b>the</b> check <b>variety</b> and ranged from 68 % to 71 %. Head rice out turn of four varieties was unsatisfactory out of 10 varieties. Head rice out turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tested <b>varieties</b> ranged 33 to 91 %. All <b>the</b> Beruin <b>varieties</b> had opaque grain but appearance of seven varieties were good and remaining three were fair. The length and breadth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milled rice ranged from 4. 5 to 5. 7 and 1. 7 to 2. 4, respectively. Likewise, length to breadth ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> ranged from 2. 0 to 2. 8 and size and shape <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> were medium bold except two. All <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> contained low amylose ranged from 7. 9 to 10 % including <b>the</b> check <b>variety.</b> Protein percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> ranged from 6. 2 to 9. 4. Cooking time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beruin <b>varieties</b> {{were more or less}} similar and ranged from 14 minutes to 17. 5 minutes.

5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is the Dunster Park and Heathlands Site of Special Scientific Interest {{noted for}} nationally {{important}} lowland dry heath, dry lowland acid grassland, wood-pasture with veteran trees and ancient semi-natural oak woodland habitats. The fauna of the lowland heath includes the heath fritillary (Mellicta athalia), a nationally rare butterfly. The assemblage of beetles {{associated with the}} veteran trees is of national significance because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> and abundance of species.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} above the eastern cloister and was built between 1430 and 1508. Its {{collection}} is in three parts: early documents, housed in the Muniment Room; the collection predating 1800, housed in the Chained Library; and the post-1800 collection, housed in the Reading Room. The chapter's earlier collection was destroyed during the Reformation, so that the present library consists chiefly of early printed books, rather than medieval manuscripts. The earlier books, in the Chained Library, number 2,800 volumes and give an indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> of interests {{of the members of}} the cathedral chapter from the Reformation until 1800. The focus of the collection is predominantly theology but there are volumes on science, medicine, exploration, and languages. Books of particular interest include Pliny's Natural History printed in 1472, an Atlas of the World by Abraham Ortelius, printed in 1606 and a set of the works of Aristotle that once belonged to Erasmus. The library is open to the public at appointed times during summer and presents a small exhibition of documents and books.|$|E
