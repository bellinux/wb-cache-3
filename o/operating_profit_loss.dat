40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming (DP) model of operating {{a nuclear power}} plant (NPP). In each period the operator decides whether to run the reactor, to shut it down for preventive maintenance or refueling, or permanently close the plant for decommissioning. The maximum life of a NPP is determined by the length of the operating license issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The optimal lifetime of a NPP (from the private perspective of the plant owner, as opposed to the social perspective of the regulator) is the solution to a generalized optimal stopping problem: the operator closes a plant as soon as the expected discounted value of future <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> (<b>losses)</b> falls below the costs of decommissioning. This model extends the DP model of NPP operations introduced in Rust and Rothwell (1996) by allowing for the occurrence of “major problem spells. ” The DP model predicts that under ordinary operating conditions it is unlikely that an NPP will be closed, but the probability of decommissioning increases substantially during a major problem spell. We compare the evolution of the nuclear power industry from 1984 to 1994 to stochastic simulations of our estimated DP model to show that our model provides accurate out-of-sample predictions of early retirements of NPPs. We use the estimated DP model to forecast nuclear power generation under two policy scenarios: (1) the current 40 -year license span with no possibility of extension and (2) a “costless ” extension in operating licenses to 60 years. Our simulations show that an immediate, costless extension in operating licenses to 60 years would double the expected present discounted value of profits t...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming (DP) model of optimal {{operation of a}} nuclear power plant (NPP). In each period the operator decides whether to run the reactor at a given capacity level, to shut it down for preventive maintenance or refueling, or permanently close the plant for decommissioning. The maximal lifespan of a NPP is determined by the length of the operating license issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The optimal lifespan of a NPP (from the private perspective of the plant owner as opposed to the social perspective of the regulator) is the solution to a generalized optimal stopping problem: one closes a plant as soon as the expected discounted value of future <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> (<b>losses)</b> falls below the costs of decommissioning. This model extends the DP model of NPP operations introduced in Rust and Rothwell (1995) by allowing for the occurrence of ``major problem spells''. The DP model predicts that under ordinary operating conditions {{it is highly unlikely that}} an NPP will be closed, but that the probability of decommissioning increases by orders of magnitude during a major problem spell. We compare the actual evolution of the nuclear power industry over the period 1984 to 1994 to stochastic simulations of our estimated DP model and show that our model provides accurate out-of-sample predictions of total nuclear power generation and early retirements of NPPs. We use the estimated DP model to forecast nuclear power generation and plant closures under two policy scenarios: 1) the current 40 year license span with no possibility of extension, and 2) a ``costless'' extension in operating licenses to 60 years. Our simulations show that an immediate, costless extension in operating licenses to 60 years would extend the life of the US nuclear power industry from 2030 to 2050 and double the expected present discounted value of profits of NPPs. ...|$|R

The thesis {{of this study is to}} determine how reliable the external auditors’ going-concern opinion in Nigeria is. The study collected data on the nature of audit reports, working capital, net <b>profit</b> or <b>loss</b> after tax and cash flow from operating activities of twenty- five randomly selected listed public companies over ten year period from 1999 to 2008. Going-concern status of a business firm was theoretically estimated by three indicators: the persistent working capital adequacy (or deficiency), net <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> (or <b>losses)</b> and positive or negative cash flow from the operating activities of a business firm over a consecutive three year period. Using spearman rank correlation technique we discovered statistically significant positive relationships between the nature of audit reports and the going-concern statuses of business firms.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} value {{relevance}} of fair value {{gains and losses}} for an international sample of banks. We investigate if the value relevance of fair value gains and losses increases or decreases with bank risk. One possibility is that, as risk increases, the scope for subjectivity in fair value estimates increases thereby potentially rendering the numbers less useful. However {{another possibility is that}} the relevance of faithfully reported fair values increases as risk increases. We ask which of the two opposing forces is greatest. Using hand collected data we construct a model of bank returns based on the most important components of a bank’s net income. We disaggregate net income into profits before taxes, loan loss provisions, fair value gains and losses, and other operating income. We also distinguish between the <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> and <b>loss</b> provisions of retail and corporate banking lines of business. The main finding is that the value relevance of fair value gains and losses is positively related to the level of bank risk prior to the crisis. During the crisis there is also evidence of a similar positive relationship, but {{it is not possible to}} draw firm conclusions for reasons we discuss. As a complement to the main result we find that the fair value gains/losses of banks that elect to use the fair value option for assets that could have been accounted for in terms of amortized costs are more value relevant and persistent. From a policy viewpoint our results suggest that, since fair value gains and losses of banks are especially informative for risky banks, such gains and losses should be separately accounted for according to line of business...|$|R

Methods. Profitability of the Specialized Medical Biochemical Laboratory (Laboratory) of the General County Hospital in Našice, Croatia, was determined using the <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account for 2007. Business success was expressed using the accounting measures of marginal contribution, gross income, and operating income, which could show whether or not the laboratory was operating profitably. This procedure allowed us to identify indicators of successful or unsuccessful business operations of the Laboratory. Results.

The <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> margin is measured as <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> divided by <b>operating</b> income (OPROF), while asset turnover is measured as operating income divided by average net fixed assets (ATURN). We also argue that the strategic positions should be persistent over years. If firms change strategy, their R&D spending likely change as well.|$|R

40|$|Aim To perform SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) {{analysis}} of a clinical laboratory as an economic model {{that may be used}} to improve business performance of laboratories by removing weaknesses, minimizing threats, and using external opportunities and internal strengths. Methods Impact of possible threats to and weaknesses of the Clinical Laboratory at Našice General County Hospital business performance and use of strengths and opportunities to improve <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> were simulated using models created on the basis of SWOT analysis results. The <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> as a measure of profitability of the clinical laboratory was defined as total revenue minus total expenses and presented using a <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account. Changes in the input parameters in the <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account for 2008 were determined using opportunities and potential threats, and economic sensitivity analysis was made by using changes in the key parameters. The <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> account and economic sensitivity analysis were tools for quantifying the impact of changes in the revenues and expenses on the business operations of clinical laboratory. Results Results of simulation models showed that operational profit of € 470 723 in 2008 could be reduced to only € 21 542 if all possible threats became a reality and current weaknesses remained the same. Also, operational gain could be increased to € 535 804 if laboratory strengths and opportunities were utilized. If both the opportunities and threats became a reality, the operational profit would decrease by € 384 465. Conclusion The operational profit of the clinical laboratory could be significantly reduced if all threats became a reality and the current weaknesses remained the same. The operational profit could be increased by utilizing strengths and opportunities as much as possible. This type of modeling may be used to monitor business operations of any clinical laboratory and improve its financial situation by implementing changes in the next fiscal period...|$|R
