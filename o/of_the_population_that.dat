5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The most radical faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>that</b> a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects on}} living {{conditions}} {{the industrial revolution}} have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.

Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> <b>that</b> {{was at the bottom}} of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards. During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.|$|E
