5|$|The {{film was}} loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the {{conventions}} of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as <b>Once</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in <b>Once</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> in the West.

5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform {{is kind of}} like blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something is better than nothing.

In her recap, she points out: [...] "Need any more proof that Rumplestiltskin is <b>Once</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>A</b> <b>Time’s</b> best character? The episodes focused on him just seem to fly by.

5|$|The {{director}} {{relied on}} a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a Dream. For The Fountain, Aronofsky {{was inspired by a}} research trip he took to Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy.

The film <b>Once</b> <b>Upon</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> in America also served as an influence on the script.
