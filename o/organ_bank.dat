5000|$|Veniss Underground alludes {{in several}} places to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Like Orpheus, Shadrach descends into the underworld to {{retrieve}} his love, Nicola, but here from a cyborg hell, where genetic engineering and DNA splicing create fantastic and horrific creatures. Parallels also exist with Dante's Inferno. Throughout the novel the idea of heaven and hell come into play. Nick looks into the chaotic world in which he tries to find purpose through what is called living art. Nick journeys into the underworld and makes {{a deal with the}} [...] "devil", also known as Quin. As the story progresses, the reader takes on the second person perspective of Nicola and is introduced to a meerkat whom Nicola names Salvador. Salvador (an assassin meerkat sent by Quin) attacks Nicola but she incapacitates him. Nick arrives at Nicola's door and chokes her till she is near death and sent to an <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> in the underworld. Shadrach comes into play in the third person point of view and takes the initiative of finding his lost love Nicola in the underworld. He finds Salvador injured at Nicola's apartment and cuts off the meerkat's head and attaches it to a plate and renames him John the Baptist. After, with the help of Dr. Fergusen, he finds a partially mutilated Nicola in an <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> under a pile of miscellaneous body parts guarded by a naked troll. He carries Nicola through the underground tunnels back to his childhood home and finds a creation of Quin named Candle. Candle leads Nick to the Psyche witch named Rafter. After Rafter decides to try to salvage Nicola, Shadrach takes the action of venturing deeper into the underworld to kill Quin. He finds Nick, now transformed into a piece of living art, being attacked by some in the garbage re-cycling facility. Nick takes Shadrach lower and tells him how to get to Quin by jumping off a moving train with a parachute. Nick pushes Shadrach out of the train only to be shot by Shadrach as he falls. Shadrach manages to open his chute yet he hits the ground hard. Later, he wakes by a beach and an ocean and kicks over a skull where he finds another creation of Quin's called the Gollux. The Gollux tells him the truth while John the Baptist lies, the Gollux leads Shadrach to a ray-like creature named the saylber which Shadrach rides across the ocean and into Quin's world which is actually a very large minnow named the leviathan. He kills Quin and the remote and the whole place explodes. Shadrach climbs up the cliffs back to the subway level. Shadrach retrieves Nicola and takes her to the surface where they are both on a bridge staring at the city which is called Veniss.|$|E

5000|$|After {{a gruesome}} murder {{on the subway}} in an area called Paradise Loop, A.D. Police steps in to help find the killer when the normal police don't seem up to the task. A total of six prostitutes are found to all have been murdered on this subway line and it is {{suspected}} the work is done by a boomer. Two officers of the normal police, Iris Kara and her partner, doubt that the killer is a boomer and are cast in this episode to help find the killer {{and bring them to}} justice. While the victims all share the same stabbing to the abdomen, they died however from massive cardiac arrest or shock. Iris goes to the <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> to replace her eye with a cybernetic one and runs into Leon, who knows her from his time in the regulars. Leon attempts to dissuade her from the surgery, saying she'll lose part of her humanity. Iris laughs it off. Later, during a consult with the doctor, she overhears an argument started by another of the clients, Ms. Caroline Evers, a billionaire and business tycoon. Iris has a hunch Caroline is somehow connected to the murders, and asks Leon and Gina to help her shadow her. They track Caroline to an abandoned industrial district that Paradise Loop runs under. After some further investigation, Iris discovers that Caroline has had her entire lower body replaced with cybernetics. While investigating Paradise Loop, Iris is ambushed by Caroline. Caroline explains that long ago she had been competing for CEO of her current company, however a man got the job because he concocted a falsified chart that compared her menstrual cycles to her productivity. To alleviate the concerns of the company's board of directors, she had most all of her female organs replaced with cybernetic versions. There no longer being any reason to keep her from becoming CEO, she got the job. In time, the same man came to work under her and they fell in love and eventually married. She later discovered he had cheated on her with a Paradise Loop prostitute, and when asked why, his response was [...] "real women are better after all." [...] After finishing her confession, Caroline moves to kill Iris, but AD Police led by Leon and Gina break through the walls and open fire, saving her. Caroline escapes, and Leon reveals that should more than 70% of the human body becomes cybernetic, a citizen is treated as a [...] "boomeroid" [...] and thus can be killed with the same prejudice as a boomer. Iris disagrees, saying that Caroline is still human, and should be arrested instead of killed. Fleeing to a subway train on the Loop, Caroline enters a car full of lowlifes and exposes herself, hoping to feel like a woman again. After AD Police stop the train with crash foam, she is found stabbed to death. Leon remarks that it didn't matter to the city whether or not Caroline was a boomer or a human. The episode closes with Iris opting to undergo the cybernetic surgery, and [...] "throw away a bit of her humanity." ...|$|E
40|$|More {{than forty}} years ago, Kato[1957] posed the <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> hypothesis. Namely, he {{stressed}} that in prewar Japan, many of the banks were tightly connected with certain industrial companies, and those banks loosely gave loans to the connected companies, which eventually resulted in the Showa Financial Crisis. This view has been widely accepted by economic historians. However, {{there has been no}} attempt to test the <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> hypothesis quantitatively. In this paper, we tested the <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> hypothesis using quantitative data and econometrical methodology. First, we compiled a comprehensive database of company directors and auditors, based on Zenkoku Shogaisha Yakuinroku 1926 issue(Shogyo Koshinjo[1926]), and using the database we identified the interlocking of directors and auditors between banks and non -banking companies. Interlocking of directors and auditors between banks and non -banking companies was very pervasive. Nearly 90 % of ordinary banks had more than one directors or auditors who were at the same time directors or auditors of non -banking companies, and average number of interlocking per bank was as large as 7. 85. Observing by banks scale, we found that interlocking was more pervasive in the large-sized banks. Second, using the interlocking variables, we examine the influence of interlocking on bank performance. Through regression analyses we found that interlocking tended to give negative effect on the liquidity performance and profitability of banks, and increased the probability of bank closures in 1927. Also, the interest rates of the deposits of those banks with interlocking were relatively high, while the interest rate of loans were not, and consequently profit margins of those banks were relatively small. It implies that the banks with interlocking should offer relatively high interest rate to gather deposits, because of the low evaluation of the financial market. Those findings support the <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> hypothesis. In prewar Japan, banks' business practices based on connection of the directors and auditors made the banking system unsound, and eventually caused the Showa Financial Crisis in 1927. On the other hand, many of the literature on the Asian Crisis in 1997 stress exploitation of the minority shareholders by the core members of the family-based companies. In this sense, the Showa Financial Crisis was a predecessor of the Asian Crisis in 1997. ...|$|E
40|$|In prewar Japan, {{many banks}} were {{controlled}} by industrial companies through capital and personal relationships. Those banks are called "organ banks" (kikan ginko). Organ banks engaged in unsound lending to their related companies, which gave {{damage to the}} banks' financial conditions, and consequently made the financial system unstable. This is an accepted view on the financial history in prewar Japan (<b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> hypothesis). However, this view {{has been based on}} case studies and casual observations. In this paper we examine the <b>organ</b> <b>bank</b> hypothesis using quantitative data and econometric methodology. To measure the extent of connections between banks and non-banking companies, we compile a comprehensive database of directors and auditors of banks and non-banking companies in 1926. It is found that interlocking of directors and auditors between banks and non-banking companies were very pervasive. More than 80 % of ordinary banks had at least one director or auditor who was {{at the same time a}} director or auditor of at least one non-banking company. Also, regression analyses confirm that director interlocking had a negative effect on bank performance, especially for small-sized banks. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{only way}} to end the organlegging problem was to reduce the demand for human organs. Given the desire of humans to extend their lives, the {{only way to}} reduce the demand was to find a {{substitute}} for transplant stock. However, the draconian anti-technology laws of the ARM hindered all developments. It was not until the mid-24th century that alloplasty, improved prosthetics, and most importantly, the ability to grow the needed organs by manipulating one's own DNA, ultimately made the <b>organ</b> <b>banks</b> obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The {{politically}} {{independent and}} individualist Belters {{took a different}} approach, as they viewed survival as a virtue in and of itself. Not only were they reluctant to turn otherwise healthy people into transplant stock, but accidents in space rarely resulted in viable organs to harvest. Thus, maintaining <b>organ</b> <b>banks</b> would require even more draconian measures than were used on Earth. Instead, their {{solution to the problem}} was to keep transplant prices as high as the market would allow. This, along with extensive research into prosthetics, reduced demand to meet the supply.|$|R

40|$|Initially {{viewed as}} {{doubtful}} and plagued with uncertainty, {{the process of}} organ/tissue transplantation {{has proved to be}} one of the most successful medical breakthroughs of modern medicine. From the initial documented success of organ/tissue donation and subsequent transplantation, the need for organ/tissue donation exceeds the available resources. Many individuals are aware of the need for organ/tissue donation for life-saving transplantation but do not take the necessary steps to become a donor or share that desire with family and/or loved ones. There are no national programs or efforts in place for standardized nursing education about organ/tissue donation and transplantation. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase nurses’ knowledge of the New England <b>Organ</b> <b>Bank</b> (NEOB) guidelines for organ and tissue donation. The project design was a pre-test, an educational program, and post-test. Twenty-two nurses completed the pre-test component (N= 22, 63 %) and fourteen nurses completed the post-test (N= 14, 40 %). Results indicated nurses had better overall better knowledge of organ donation then specifically tissue donation. Nursing staff demonstrated increased knowledge of NEOB guidelines and the nurse’s role in timely reporting after the educational program on organ donation with improved post-test over pre-test scores.
