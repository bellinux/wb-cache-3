40|$|We {{consider}} a queue fed {{by a large}} number, say n, of on-off sources with generally distributed on-and off-times. The queueing resources are scaled by n: the buffer is B=nb and link rate is C=nc. The model is versatile: {{it allows us to}} model both long range dependent traffic (by using heavy-tailed distributed <b>on-periods)</b> and short range dependent traffic (by using light-tailed <b>on-periods).</b> A crucial performance metric in this model is the steady-state buffer overflow probability. This overflow probability decays exponentially in the number of sources n. Therefore, if thenumber of sources grows large, naive simulation is too time-consuming, and we have to use fastsimulation techniques instead. Due to the exponential decay (in n), importance sampling with an exponential change of measureessentially goes through, irrespective of the on-times being heavy-tailed or light-tailed. Anasymptotically optimal change of measure is found by using large deviations arguments. Notably,the change of measure is not constant during the simulation run, which is essentially differentfrom many other studies (usually relying on large buffer asymptotics). We provide numerical examples to show that the resulting importance sampling procedure indeedimproves considerably over naive simulation. We present some accelerations.

The analytic traffic model, called N-Burst, uses the superposition of N independent cell streams of ON/OFF type with Power-Tail distributed ON periods. Delay for such arrival processes is mainly caused by over-saturation periods, which occur when too many sources are in their ON-state. The duration of these over-saturation periods is shown to have a Power-Tail distribution, whose exponent fi is in most scenarios different from the tail exponent of the individual <b>ON-period.</b> Conditions on the model parameters, for which the mean and higher moments of the delay distribution become infinite, are investigated.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new class of traffic {{profiles}} that is better suited for metering bursty Internet traffic streams than the traditional token bucket profile. A good traffic profile should satisfy two criteria: first, it should consider packets from a conforming traffic stream as in profile with high probability to ensure a strong QoS guarantee; second, it should limit the network resources consumed by a non-conforming traffic stream to no more than that consumed by a conforming stream. We model a bursty Internet traffic stream as an ON/OFF stream, where both the <b>ON-period</b> and the OFF-period have a heavy-tailed distribution. Our study shows that the heavy-tailed distribution leads to an excessive randomness in the long-term session rate distribution. Therefore, it is inherently difficult for any profile that limits the long-term average session rate to give a strong QoS guarantee for the conforming traffic streams. Our simulation demonstrates that a token bucket profile that couples the average rate control and the burst size control has a weak QoS guarantee. Based on this result, we propose {{a new class}} of traffic profiles that decouples the long term average rate control from the burst size control. Compared to a token bucket profile, this profile improves the level of QoS for a conforming traffic stream, yet limits the “effective bandwidth” consumed by a non-conforming traffic stream...|$|E

We measured, during the entire observation period, the effect of deep brain stimulation on motor and functional outcome measures, the levodopa equivalent daily dose and the total electrical energy delivered.

Since preventive maintenance can be planned during off-periods, there is a perspective of significant savings if some freedom is built in concerning the starting time of preventive maintenance. Therefore, a two-stage maintenance policy is considered, which—in a first stage—provides the maintenance manager with a finite interval during which preventive maintenance must be carried out, and—in a second stage—determines the optimal starting time for preventive maintenance within this interval. Computational results offer useful insights, and indicate that significant savings can be achieved in comparison with a classical age maintenance policy. ...|$|R

Moreover, the sequences exhibit a state space collapse-like property when the number of sources is large enough, which is a kind of extension of the well-known Little's law for M/M/ 1 queueing system.

In chronically instrumented conscious unrestrained Zucker obese rats we examined ultradian fluctuations in BAT, body and brain temperatures, and the relation between BAT temperature and eating. The interval between BAT temperature peaks for the 12 hour dark phase was 121 ± 3 (mean ± SE) min for Zucker obese rats and 91 ± 3 min for control lean rats (p b 0. 01). Corresponding values for the light phase were 148 ± 6 and 118 ± 4 min (p b 0. 01). Mean BAT and body temperatures were lower in Zucker obese rats, in comparison with lean controls, during both BAT on-periods and BAT off-periods.

Each session comprises two trains of 50 stimuli each delivered at 1 Hz and at 90 % of daily rest motor threshold using a large circular coil over the vertex. The effect of the stimulation, delivered during the <b>ON-period,</b> was evaluated during both ON and OFF periods. Tests were carried out before and after the stimulation period, and again 1 week after. The effect of the stimulation was evaluated through several gait variables (cadence, step amplitude, velocity, the CVstride-time, and the turn time), hand dexterity, and also the total and motor sections of the UPDRS. Only the total and motor section of the UPDRS and the turn time during gait were affected by the stimulation, the effect appearing during either ON or OFF evaluation, and most importantly, equally displayed in both real and sham group. The rest of the variables were not influenced. We conclude the protocol of stimulation used, different from most protocols that apply larger amount of stimuli, but very similar to some previously reported to have excellent results, has no therapeutic value and should be abandoned. This contrasts with the positive reported effects using higher frequency and focal coils. Our work also reinforces the need for sham stimulation when evaluating the therapeutic effect of rTMS.
