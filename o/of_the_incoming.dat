5|$|Deserts, both hot and cold, {{play a part}} in moderating the Earth's temperature. This {{is because}} they reflect more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{data sets}} may be {{necessary}} for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} line filter {{may be a}} collimator, which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used here to block light.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advantage}} of this method over addition of organometallic reagents to more typical acyl compounds is that it avoids the common problem of over-addition. For these latter reactions, two equivalents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> group add to form an alcohol rather than a ketone or aldehyde. This occurs even if the equivalents of nucleophile are closely controlled.|$|E
30|$|We use NiRTT to {{represent}} <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> RTTs for <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> connection <b>of</b> host hi, NoRTT <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> RTTs for <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> connection <b>of</b> host hi, and ΔioRTT {{the difference between}} these numbers. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> this difference can be used to determine the probability that the two connections are relayed. The larger ΔioRTT, the lower the probability that the two connections are relayed, and the lower the probability that the host hi is used as a stepping-stone.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Virtual {{connection}} tree (VCT) is {{a network}} architecture that can upgrade the quality-of-service (QoS) in wireless {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) network. The call admission control (CAC) limits <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> calls into <b>the</b> network {{in order to maintain}} <b>the</b> quality-of-service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> on going calls, which are already connected to the network. In this paper two different types of systems using VCT are compared, one with queue for new <b>incoming</b> calls and <b>the</b> other without <b>the</b> queue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>incoming</b> calls. Both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems use prioritizing scheme of handoff calls. There will be some delay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>incoming</b> calls when using system with queue. <b>The</b> probability <b>of</b> delay and <b>the</b> handoff dropping probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems will be analyzed...|$|R

5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect a large amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus {{is divided into three}} species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{heaviest}} {{among the}} troops landing {{at either end}} of Omaha. In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red, scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle, many of them having crawled the 300 yards (270m) of beach just ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> tide. Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach, A/116 had been cut to pieces, the leaders among the 120 or so casualties, the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water's edge or behind obstacles. The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better, having made the shelter of the bluffs, but were also down to half strength.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{in one of}} {{the closest}} polls in UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts. Nicholls was the Conservative member from 1950 to 1974, when he lost in the October {{election}} of that year to Labour's Michael Ward, having held on by just 22 votes after four recounts in the election eight months earlier. The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the seat to the Conservative Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> Conservative government and was a Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).|$|E

5|$|The {{constant}} {{change of}} colonial administrators, {{and the corresponding}} reissue of encomienda licenses to relatives and friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> official, prolonged the instability {{in the province of}} Chiapa. In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids.|$|E
5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis to one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an invigorated Walter ventures out to Chinatown {{to find a}} herbalist for his research; {{unaware of}} the clerk's {{connection}} to the case, Walter casually mentions the giant worms. Walter manages to lose Astrid (Jasika Nicole), who was sent to follow him out of worry {{for his ability to}} travel alone. She goes back to the lab, but is attacked by Triad gang members intent on getting back the remaining worms. Unaware of this, a distraught Walter becomes lost and wastes all his bus money on wrong phone numbers, causing Peter to have to pick him up. Olivia talks to Jarvis, who finally admits to being aware of the medicine. She tells Olivia the whereabouts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> ship, but they find it already empty. Peter and Walter return to the herbalist shop and discover the remaining passengers. The FBI storms in and the survivors are sent to the hospital for care. Feeling remorseful about the trouble he caused, Walter injects himself with a tracking implant and gives Peter the transponder.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} phenomenon {{that took place}} within the lands of Poland in the Early Middle Ages, {{as well as other}} parts of central and eastern Europe, was the arrival and permanent settlement of Slavic peoples. The Slavic migrations in the area of contemporary Poland started {{in the second half of}} the 5th century AD, about a half century after these territories were vacated by Germanic tribes. The first waves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present southeastern Poland and southern Masovia. Coming from the east, from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River, the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as Sclaveni, and since their arrival are classified as West Slavs. Their early archeological traces belong to the Prague-Korchak culture, which is similar to the earlier Kiev culture.|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> Congress's first actions would be to establish the Department of the Interior, so Taylor would be appointing that department's inaugural secretary. Thomas Ewing, who had previously served as a senator from Ohio and as Secretary of the Treasury under William Henry Harrison, accepted the patronage-rich position of Secretary of the Interior. For the position of Postmaster General, which {{also served as a}} center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman Jacob Collamer of Vermont. After Horace Binney refused appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in William M. Meredith. George W. Crawford a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of Secretary of War, while Congressman William B. Preston of Virginia became Secretary of the Navy. Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland accepted appointment as Attorney General, and Johnson {{became one of the most}} influential members of Taylor's cabinet. Vice President Fillmore was not in favor with Taylor, and Fillmore was largely sidelined throughout Taylor's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{hurricane}} passed, the Grenada Emergency Operations Center temporarily prevented relief supplies from entering the country to ensure the safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> items; the decision was reversed shortly thereafter, and planes flew supplies during daylight hours into the reopened airport. Severe looting occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ivan, prompting police officials to enact a curfew for the night hours. In the first week following the hurricane, aid was slow to the affected residents, due to the lack of an efficient aid distribution system. 30official shelters and 17prepared ones housed over 5,000people in the aftermath of the storm. Thousands of people lost their jobs due to the hurricane, with all businesses shut down following the hurricane. By two months after the hurricane struck, 65schools were opened, some of which serving as shelters; water and power were gradually restored to the island. By a year after the storm's passage, all schools were reopened, and most buildings enacted provisional repairs. Officials determined around 10,000houses on the island required complete reconstruction, while a further 22,000 needed repairs. The government of Grenada initially planned to rebuild 1,000houses in the year after the hurricane struck; by June 2005, 260families were provided houses, with a further 85under construction. The government also established a Material Assistance Programme, which provided $5,000 (2004XCD) of free materials to more than 5,000families, as well as a total of $4.3million (2004XCD) in low interest loans to 148families. Several indirect fatalities occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane, primarily senior citizens.|$|E
