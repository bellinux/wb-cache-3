40|$|Abstract Background Scoping studies (or reviews) are {{a method}} used to {{comprehensively}} map evidence across {{a range of}} study designs in an area, with the aim of informing future research practice, programs and policy. However, no universal agreement exists on terminology, definition or methodological steps. Our aim was to understand the experiences of, and considerations for conducting scoping studies from the perspective of academic and community partners. Primary objectives were to 1) describe experiences conducting scoping studies including strengths and challenges; and 2) describe perspectives on terminology, definition, and methodological steps. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey with clinicians, educators, researchers, knowledge users, representatives from community-based organizations, graduate students, and policy stakeholders with experience and/or interest in conducting scoping studies to gain an understanding of experiences and perspectives on the conduct and reporting of scoping studies. We administered an electronic self-reported questionnaire comprised of 22 items related to experiences with scoping studies, strengths and challenges, opinions on terminology, and methodological steps. We analyzed questionnaire data using descriptive statistics and content analytical techniques. Survey results were discussed during a multi-stakeholder consultation to identify key considerations in the conduct and reporting of scoping studies. Results Of the 83 invitations, 54 individuals (65  %) completed the scoping questionnaire, and 48 (58  %) attended the scoping study meeting from Canada, the United Kingdom and United States. Many scoping study strengths were dually identified as challenges including breadth of scope, and iterative process. No consensus on terminology emerged, however key defining features that comprised a working definition of scoping studies included the exploratory mapping of literature in a field; iterative process, inclusion of grey literature; no quality assessment of included studies, and an <b>optional</b> <b>consultation</b> phase. We offer considerations for the conduct and reporting of scoping studies for researchers, clinicians and knowledge users engaging in this methodology. Conclusions Lack of consensus on scoping terminology, definition and methodological steps persists. Reasons for this may be attributed to diversity of disciplines adopting this methodology for differing purposes. Further work is needed to establish guidelines on the reporting and methodological quality assessment of scoping studies...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper aims at understanding what Economic Degree undergraduates {{of a public}} university recognize the recent New Economic Model (NEM) as and perhaps interpret given certain issues posed to them. Throughout the three month period of written assignment and <b>optional</b> bi-weekly <b>consultation,</b> each of the 64 {{respondents were asked to}} review the NEM report and identify key areas they considered to be of high priority at present. They were allowed to share ideas but advised to provide preferably own reasons to support their thoughts. It is timely to conduct studies related to the NEM in general as the successful implementation of this broad-based economic policy depends on the continuous feedback from all stakeholders. Findings of the current project are expected to shed light on how the young generation perceive of the NEM as well as their prospective attitude towards its executionNEM, graduates, understanding, expectation, attitude...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Students {{often need}} {{to go beyond the}} canned content {{provided}} by an e-Learning system’s designer. A teacher usually suggests a supplementary corpus, traditionally in the form of books for <b>optional</b> reading and <b>consultation.</b> In an e-Learning context the supplementary corpus would consist of resources which are accessible over the Web, some specified by a teacher and some identified {{with the help of a}} search engine. The location of the resources is irrelevant as long as they are accessible over the Web. The paper offers a structured description of a student’s assistant designed to identify relevant information from the supplementary corpus. The users are students who indicate a need for help in specific e-Learning situations. Student’s learning styles and personalization issues are discussed in this context...|$|R
40|$|Parents of {{handicapped}} children face special challenges if {{they attempt to}} assure maximal development of their children. The present study was designed with an assumption that parental tactics {{must be based on}} long term analysis of needs and short term implementation of behavioral parenting objectives. ^ A review of the literature on problems of parents with {{handicapped children}} and on psychological models describing the role of parents yielded limited conceptual guidelines but no disagreements with the notion of attempting to increase children 2 ̆ 7 s self-help and positive self reference statements. Prevention of future problems by increasing parent planning and problem solving skills was also found conceptually consistent with the varied opinions about the role of parents. A program was designed with all elements operationally defined based on the above conceptual guidelines. ^ Fifteen couples with children having varied handicaps and ages from 1 to 13 verbally committed themselves to attend one of three groups meeting for weekly sessions for 8 to 10 weeks. A staggered multiple baseline design controlled historical influences by group. Parents from 8 of the 15 families attended differing numbers of sessions and responded to pretests and posttests which consisted of paper-pencil instruments measuring moods, assertiveness and future hopefulness, in addition to self-rating of their child and their parenting skills. Moods and future hopefulness were also measured weekly. Post-treatment assessment additionally included a personal structured interview by a confederate of the researcher. ^ The experimental program incorporated a combination of discussion and planned exercieses to elicit planning and decision making about their children by the participants. A series of seven 2 ̆ 2 newsletters 2 ̆ 2 were written by a research confederate who is the mother of a handicapped child to additionally cue planning activities. ^ Participants expressed satisfaction with the total program but failed to respond to some of the program objectives including systematic observation of selected behaviors of their child, and setting of specific short term objectives. ^ It is recommended that evaluation procedures in future research be modified to assess individual rather than group progress and that optional learning modules be used to allow individual choice of program elements. A self help group model appears most likely {{to meet the needs of}} parents of the type participating in this pilot experiment. Due consideration must be given to reinforcement of attendance by dividing sessions into educational and social interaction sections or by other tactics. Meetings must be more than a week apart for parents of handicapped children, and provision should be made for <b>optional</b> individual <b>consultation</b> to resolve problems. ^ It is concluded that the need for preventive programming to help parents of handicapped children set present objectives based on analysis of desired futures for their children remains largely unmet, and that significant modifications should be made in the pilot program to achieve such ends. ...|$|R
