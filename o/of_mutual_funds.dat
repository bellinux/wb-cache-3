40|$|Abstract: This thesis investigates empirically and {{theoretically}} {{the behavior}} <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> investors and managers. These two aspects {{are closely related}} to each other. Investors try to select funds that follow an optimal investment policy from their point of view, while fund managers are typically interested in maximizing net fund inflows. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we analyze the determinants <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> flows, concentrating on the impact of past performance on fund flows. In particular, we investigate the lag structure of the flow-performance relationship and the impact of different classification systems on fund flows. In the second part of the thesis, we study the strategic behavior <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> managers. In this part, we first consider the impact of auto-correlation and cross-correlation in fund returns on statistical tests of risk taking by fund managers performed in the literature. Finally, in a two-period model, we study risk-taking incentives <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> managers with ranking objectives and then empirically test the predictions of the model. ...|$|R
40|$|We use <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> {{flow data}} {{to test the}} smart money effect. The smart money effect happens when a <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> {{receives}} higher inflow and then the <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> will perform well in the next period. We use Fama and French three factors model and Carhart four factors model to calculate the performance <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund.</b> And also use the two models to calculate the Alpha of portfolio. If the Alpha is significant greater than zero, we confirm the existence of smart money effect. If the Alpha is not significant greater than zero, we compare the Alpha between the portfolio made by inflow and portfolio made by fund value. If the Alpha of inflow portfolio is significant greater than the Alpha of fund value portfolio, we say the money of investors is comparatively smart. We use the monthly data from January 2001 to January 2010. The data set includes inflow <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund,</b> outflow <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund,</b> <b>fund</b> value <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> and the net flow <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund.</b> The result shows that only the Alpha of equal weighted net flow portfolio is significant. The other {{results show that the}} money of investors is comparatively smart. 本文以共同基金流量資料進行聰明錢效果的研究。聰明錢效果是指，當期接受到基金流入量高的共同基金，其下期共同基金績效會表現良好。使用共同基金流量的資料當作選取投資組合的指標，再以三因子以及四因子模型檢驗共同基金績效，並且計算所選出的投資組合的Alpha，看是否有顯著性，如果Alpha顯著大於 0 表示聰明錢效果存在。如果顯著性不明顯，則比較以共同基金流量跟以共同基金市值所作的投資組合Alpha，比較其差異性，如果以共同基金流量所作的投資組合Alpha值，大於以共同基金市值所作的投資組合，表示投資人的投資金錢有相對的聰明錢效果存在。 本研究使用資料是從 2001 年 1 月到 2010 年 1 月總共 109 個月的月資料，使用共同基金流入量、共同基金流出量、共同基金市值、共同基金淨量進行研究，結果顯示只有使用共同基金淨量且等權平均的投資組合，具有統計上顯著的聰明錢效果，其他研究結果則是支持有相對聰明的效果存在。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機	 1 第二節 研究範圍	 2 第三節 論文架構	 2 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 第一節 基金績效持續性以及基金績效衡量	 4 第二節 聰明錢效果	 5 第三章 研究方法	 7 第一節 資料來源與處理	 7 第二節 投資組合組成	 8 第四章 實證結果	 10 第一節 敘述統計表	 10 第二節 實證分析	 11 第五章 結論與建議	 17 文獻回顧	 1...|$|R
