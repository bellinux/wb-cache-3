40|$|The acute {{lethality}} of low {{dissolved oxygen}} (DO) was examined in laboratory studies using several New Zealand freshwater fish and two invertebrates at 15 degree C. The 48 -h LC sub(50) value {{was used as}} the endpoint for acute DO sensitivity as, owing to rapid mortality, this was found to best approximate the threshold lethal concentration. Median lethal time to death did not provide a reliable endpoint for comparing sensitivities. Fish LC sub(50) values varied from 0. 54 to 2. 65 <b>mg</b> <b>litre</b> super(- 1), with inanga whitebait (Galaxias maculatus; 2. 65 plus or minus 0. 19 <b>mg</b> <b>litre</b> super(- 1), mean plus or minus SEM) being the most sensitive species tested.

Recombinant Cb 48 was expressed as a secreted and glycosylated protein. The yield of recombinant protein was 8 <b>mg</b> per <b>litre</b> of culture. In contrast, recombinant Cb 42 was not expressed at detectable levels in Pichia pastoris, probably due to A + T rich sequence which may cause premature transcriptional termination. To expedite Cb 42 expression in yeast, Cb 42 was divided into two domains: Cb 42 A and Cb 42 B. Cb 42 B was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris, yielding 0. 4 <b>mg</b> per <b>litre</b> of culture. However, Cb 42 A was not expressed.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to standardize in vitro explant establishment and shoot multiplication technique for wild pear. The highest explant establishment (77. 88 %) was observed during spring, {{which was on}} a par with explant establishment frequency during winter season (76. 21 %). The lowest explant establishment was observed during rainy season (61. 94 %). The establishment frequency for shoot tips (69. 07 %) was significantly less than the establishment frequency for nodal segments (71. 95 %). The antibrowning agents decreased explant browning, yet they could not eliminate it. The magnitude of the effect of the antibrowning agents depended on the season of explant collection and type of explant. Antibrowning agents were more useful during spring and winter seasons when the incidence of browning was low, in comparison to rainy, summer and autumn seasons when the browning was comparatively high. Though, the highest number of shoots (11. 24 / culture) were obtained with 2. 0 <b>mg</b> per <b>litre</b> BA, but this BA level did not produce shoots of desirable length (> 2. 0 cm). BA (1. 5 <b>mg</b> per <b>litre)</b> + IBA (0. 5 <b>mg</b> per <b>litre)</b> was the best growth regulator combination for shoot multiplication in wild pear as it produced sufficient number of shoots (10. 21 shoots per culture) having desirable shoot length.

The total phenolic content was determined spectrophotometrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and expressed as the gallic acid <b>equivalent</b> (<b>mg</b> GA/g of extract). The highest value was obtained in the ethyl acetate extract (57. 02 mg GA/g). The concentration of flavonoids, determined using a spectrophotometric method with aluminum chloride and expressed as the rutin <b>equivalent</b> (<b>mg</b> RU/g of extract), was highest in the ethyl acetate extract (91. 76 mg RU/g). The antioxidant activity was determined in vitro using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reagent. The highest antioxidant activity was detected in the acetone extract (SC 50 value = 330. 52 μg/mL). In vitro antimicrobial activities were determined using a microdilution method, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) were determined. The most effective antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus was demonstrated by the acetone extract, with MIC and MMC values of 1. 25 mg/mL.
