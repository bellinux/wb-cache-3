40|$|Background: The {{relatively}} low budget impact of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> {{is often used}} as an argument in reimbursement decisions. However, overall, the budget impact of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> can still be substantial. In this study, we assess the uptake and budget impact of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> in the Netherlands. Methods. We examined the number of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{the number of patients}} and budget impact of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> in the Netherlands in the period 2006 to 2012, both for inpatient and outpatient <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> Budget impact was provided in absolute numbers and relative to total pharmaceutical spending. Results: The number of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> and patients treated increased substantially over the period studied. Overall, budget impact increased substantially over a period of six years, both in absolute terms (326 % increase) as well as relative to total pharmaceutical spending (278 % increase). Growth rates decreased over time. In 2012, 17 % of available drugs had an individual budget impact of more than 10 million per year. Conclusions: Individual budget impact of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> is often limited, although exceptions exist. However, in total, the budget impact of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> is considerable and has grown substantially over the years.

40|$|Background: Some <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> {{can cost}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars annually per patient. As a result, payer sensitivity to the cost of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> is rising, particularly in light of increased numbers of new launches in recent years. In this article, we examine payer coverage in the United States, England and Wales, and the Netherlands of outpatient <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> approved between 1983 and 2012, as well as the 11 most expensive <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> Methods: We collected data from drug regulatory agencies as well as payers and drug evaluation authorities. Results: We found that <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> have more coverage restrictions than non-orphan drugs in all three jurisdictions. From an economic perspective, the fact that a <b>drug</b> is an <b>orphan</b> product or has a high per-unit price per se should not imply a special kind of evaluation by payers, or necessarily the imposition of more coverage restrictions. Conclusion: Payers should consider the same set of decision criteria that they do with respect to non-orphan drugs: disease severity, availability of treatment alternatives, level of unmet medical need, and cost-effectiveness, criteria that justifiably may be taken into account and traded off against one another in prescribing and reimbursement decisions for <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of rare diseases which, in the EU, are defined as those with a prevalence of < 5 per 10 [*] 000 inhabitants. Characteristically, these diseases negatively affect health-related quality of life and may be life threatening. The EU has passed legislation to encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest in research programmes into rare diseases, with the aim of developing new, safe and effective <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> Objectives: To describe the status of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> in five countries in the EU (France, Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain), estimate the mean annual cost per patient and indication of these <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs,</b> and determine the associated cost of these drugs in comparison with overall spending on drugs in each country (year 2007 values). Methods: The analysis was limited solely to costs of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> with sales data available for 2007. The mean annual cost per patient was estimated using recommended regimens for maintenance dose and duration from the summary of product characteristics. Likewise, the ratio between annual costs per patient for treatment of each disease and its prevalence was calculated. Sales data were available for {{at least one of the}} countries studied for 38 of the 44 <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> authorized by the European Medicines Agency. Only 21 products had data available for all five countries studied. Results: Germany was the country with access to the largest number of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> (36), followed by the UK (34), Spain (28), France (27) and Italy (25). The mean annual cost per patient and indication of the 38 <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> on the market ranged widely from &U 20 AC; 331 to &U 20 AC; 337 [*] 501. It appears that <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> indicated to treat diseases with a prevalence of < 2 per 10 [*] 000 inhabitants have higher annual per-patient costs than those indicated to treat diseases with a higher prevalence. The percentage of total drug spending accounted for by <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> in 2007 was 1. 7 % in France, 2. 1 % in Germany, 1. 0 % in the UK, 1. 5 % in Italy and 2. 0 % in Spain, with an average overall percentage of 1. 7 % for these five countries. Conclusions: In 2007, spending on <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> in five European countries was acceptable in terms of the percentage of these countries' overall drug expenditure.

40|$|A 409 BACKGROUND: Orphan {{medicinal}} products {{are designed to}} diagnose or treat rare diseases that are serious, life threatening or chronically debilitating and that affect 50 or fewer people in every 100 &# 8201; 000 in the EU. In Belgium, the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC) evaluates reimbursement requests for <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> based on multiple criteria: the therapeutic value, price and proposed reimbursement tariff; {{the importance of the}} drug in clinical practice; and the budget impact of the drug. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess reimbursement dossiers of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> in Belgium and to compare them with the clinical evidence submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). METHODS: A qualitative analysis examined all reimbursement dossiers of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs</b> that were submitted in Belgium between January 2002 and June 2008. The following information was extracted from each dossier: description of the orphan drug; indication; reimbursement status; therapeutic value and needs; budget impact; and number of registered indications. For selected <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs,</b> an in-depth analysis extracted and compared information about the clinical trials, their primary endpoints and results from EMA documents (i. e. the marketing authorization application file, European public assessment report and summary of product characteristics) and the Belgian reimbursement dossiers. RESULTS: Reimbursement was awarded to the majority of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments, employment incentives, patient population restrictions and funding of diagnostic tests by the company, seemed {{to play a role in}} the reimbursement decision. Despite the low number of patients, randomized controlled trials were conducted for many <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> Budget-impact analyses were simplistic and did not consider the impact across multiple indications. Some differences were also observed between the clinical evidence submitted to the EMA and that submitted to the Belgian DRC. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments and employment incentives, may play a role in Belgian reimbursement decisions of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> Some differences have also been noted between the clinical evidence reported in EMA documents and the evidence included in Belgian reimbursement dossiers of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs.</b> There appears to be a need for further standardization of Belgian reimbursement applications and for European cooperation in sharing clinical evidence of <b>orphan</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
