This thesis {{introduces a}}n approach {{for the design of}} two-dimensional <b>oversampled</b> <b>filter</b> banks that allows directional frequency selectivity with low redundancy. Directional two-dimensional filter banks find application in texture classification, denoising, segmentation, and enhancement. In several of these applications, the frequency directionality relies on <b>oversampled</b> <b>filter</b> banks with redundancy factors that range from two to four. This thesis uses non uniform frequency division of the unit frequency cell to design multichannel <b>oversampled</b> <b>filter</b> banks that have frequency directionality and redundancy factor less than two.

Although in the past the design of critically sampled filter banks was addressed using a formulation based either on the factorization of polyphase matrices or on the modulation of prototype windows, the design of <b>oversampled</b> <b>filter</b> banks was more restricted to modulation.

40|$|Abstract — Frames and <b>oversampled</b> <b>filter</b> {{banks have}} been {{extensively}} studied {{over the past}} few years due to their increased design freedom and improved error resilience. In frame expan-sions, the least square signal reconstruction operator is called the dual frame, which can be obtained by choosing the synthesis filter bank as the para-pseudo inverse of the analysis bank. In this paper, we study the computation of the dual frame by exploiting the Greville formula, which was originally derived in 1960 to compute the pseudo inverse of a matrix when a new row is appended. Here, we first develop the backward Greville formula to handle the case of row deletion. Based on the forward Greville formula, we then study the computation of para-pseudo inverse for extended filter banks and Laplacian pyramids. Through the backward Greville formula, we investigate the frame-based error resilient transmission over erasure channels. The necessary and sufficient condition for an <b>oversampled</b> <b>filter</b> bank to be robust to one erasure channel is derived.
