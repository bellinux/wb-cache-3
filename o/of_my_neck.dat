2500|$|In 1993, Smith began another [...] {{relationship}} with Kelly Bates {{while she was}} only 14 years old, having met her while she was babysitting for friends. Approximately two years later, when she left school, Bates moved in with Smith {{at his home in}} Furnival Road, Gorton. She had concealed the relationship from her parents. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two began living together: [...] "As soon as I saw Smith the hairs on the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> went up. I tried everything I could to get Kelly Anne away from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|During May 2002 Wilson {{recorded}} his next album, King for a Day (July 2002), at two studios in Melbourne with Kerryn Tolhurst producing. Along with Bourne, Folley and Rodgers, the album featured Tollhurst (guest guitars, piano, mandolin and tipple), Cindy Boste (guest lead vocals), Sarah Carroll (guest lead vocals) and Skip Sail (guest banjo). In March 2003 Richard Sharman of I-94 Bar website reviewed Chris Wilson and The Spidermen's gig at the Bridge Hotel in Sydney, {{and found that}} Wilson's [...] "voice was magnificent ranging from soft tenderness to a bellowing roar that raised shivers at the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> His voice sounded better than ever and his harp playing was superb – this boy can play!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shoved you off <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> yes," [...] {{answered}} the enlisted man. [...] "But I didn't throw you into Lieutenant Horitz. You did that yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. I don't mind {{running a}} little risk <b>of</b> {{breaking}} <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> {{but not here}} on the Rock. I would rather get into ten scrapes, on board the frigate, than one here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am all right, I think, colonel; don't stay any longer. Tim {{will wait}} here. I don't think I was stunned, else I {{could not have}} given the order. No, I imagine I had a near escape <b>of</b> {{breaking}} <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll go back," [...] he said brokenly. [...] "Wilson {{told me he}} was alive, {{and that}} it was all a mistake. If he’s lying to me for the price <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old <b>neck,</b> let him have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. It's too absurd! How can we {{talk about}} such things when I cannot see you? You speak to the nape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and then I have to twist my head round to answer." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{so pleased}} me that I {{did not try}} to resist, but allowed this simple-hearted {{stranger}} to throw his arms about me and weep a few tranquilizing tears down the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> Then he went his way.|$|E
6000|$|Instead of answering, {{he gently}} lifted a long lock of my hair, which hung {{at the side}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> (My head, I should add, had been dressed that evening on the old-fashioned plan, by my aunt's maid--to please my aunt.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Roderick {{started out}} of a reverie and passed {{his hands over his}} eyes. [...] "Oh no, I can't settle down to work after such a scene as that. I was not afraid <b>of</b> {{breaking}} <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> then, but I feel all in a tremor now. I will go--I will go and sit in the sun on the Pincio!" ...|$|R
50|$|Item I give unto my son Joseph Bonner {{the other}} half <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> land lying back of Washington and {{adjoining}} thereto with {{the other half}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> land adjoining my Quarter Plantation. I likewise give my Son Joseph the House wherein I now dwell with lotts adjoining there to N 31 and N 32 one little Tobby Horse and my negro Boy Dick my negro woman Edy my negro wench Tab and my negro Boy Rherebin {{to him and his}} Heirs forever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] cried Charley. [...] "Father didn't say I wasn't to take him. I don't think he'd care much. He's {{not afraid}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{breaking}} <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> And then, Mr Grant {{seemed to be}} only afraid <b>of</b> <b>my</b> being run off with-- not of his horse being hurt. Here goes for it!" [...] In another moment Charley had him saddled and bridled, and led him out into the yard.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can we not? I shall {{show you}} that!' and {{there came a}} jerk on the bridle which nearly pulled me to the ground. At the same instant a sword flashed and the leather was cut through within two inches <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{rather have}} broken my arm, or {{anything}} short <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> than {{that she should}} have broken that flower. Arthur planted it, and now the clumsy girl has destroyed it," [...] and Mildred looked as though she were going to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is, as it were, a {{dizziness}} at {{the back}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and a pinching in it. Let me lay my head on thy lap, chela. I am an old man, but not free from passion ... We must think of the Cause of Things.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{knew the}} voice. It was Warden Atherton's. And I knew myself for Darrell Standing, just {{returned}} across the centuries to the jacket hell of San Quentin. And I knew the touch <b>of</b> finger-tips on <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> was Warden Atherton's. And I knew the finger-tips that displaced his were Doctor Jackson's. And it was Doctor Jackson's voice that said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very well}} waited on, Jacob, {{and if you}} were to try to wait on me at table while the vessel is rolling, you would be pretty sure to spill a plate <b>of</b> soup down <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> or {{something}} <b>of</b> that sort. You amuse yourself in your own way, and don't worry about me; when there is anything to do I know you will do it.' ...|$|R
60|$|But how I have {{anticipated}} my history! I must return, {{to tell you}} that when I was just sixteen I was told that I was to go to my first ball at Whitehall. My hair was curled over my forehead, and I was dressed in white satin, with the famous pearls <b>of</b> Ribaumont round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> though <b>of</b> course they were not to be mine eventually.|$|R
60|$|When I {{tell you}} that just as I heard these frightful words a fairly {{substantial}} beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and I couldn't even stir to squash the same, you will understand that I felt pretty rotten. Everything seemed against me.|$|E
6000|$|... "'How'd that Buck Caperton get in here?' and he skinned {{the side}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> with a bullet. I reckon he felt bad over that miss, for Berry's {{the best shot}} south of the Southern Pacific Railroad. But the smoke in the saloon was some too thick for good shooting.|$|E
60|$|There were times, too, {{when faced}} by a mighty cave bear, a saber-toothed tiger, or huge felis spelaea, black-maned and terrible, even my {{powerful}} rifle seemed pitifully inadequate--but fortune favored {{me so that}} I passed unscathed through adventures that even the recollection of causes the short hairs to bristle at the nape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Dunlop, you are {{the younger}} man, so I will hand him over to you. I will put this coil <b>of</b> rope round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and will take the water and food. It is so dark now {{that they will not}} see us from below. If those fellows had but waited half an hour we could have gained the top without this sad business. Will you go first, Dunlop?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant," [...] said my companion. [...] "Now tie {{this bit}} <b>of</b> card round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> {{so as to}} hang {{it in front of}} me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my {{handkerchief}} into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment." ...|$|R
60|$|As I buttered a piece <b>of</b> bread <b>my</b> eyes chanced to rest upon my hand. The {{knuckles}} were skinned and inflamed clear across, {{the fingers}} swollen, the nails rimmed with black. I felt the mattress-like growth <b>of</b> beard on <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> {{knew that the}} sleeve <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat was ripped, that a button was missing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore. The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip. It was very natural {{that it should be}} there,—how natural I had not imagined until now, when I looked upon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it must appear to her.|$|R
60|$|I parried that thrust, but I only parried {{it when it}} {{was within}} some three inches <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and even as I turned it aside it missed me as {{narrowly}} as it might without tearing my skin. The imminence of the peril had been such that, as we mutually recovered, I found a cold sweat bathing me.|$|E
60|$|But {{those words}} of his put {{something}} new into my head. Could we not decide the matter in some better way than fighting? The Bart was placing me in such a position that I should have to hurt him, or he would certainly hurt me. I avoided his rush, though his sword-point was within an inch <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I knew dot I {{had made}} Bimi a life's-enemy, pecause his fingers haf talk murder {{through the back}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> Next dime I see Bimi dere was a pistol in my belt, und he touched it once, und I open der breech to show him it was loaded. He haf seen der liddle monkeys killed in der woods: he understood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Euphemia, [...] "let's put it up." [...] I agreed {{instantly}} to this proposition, {{and we went}} to {{look for}} a ladder. We found one in the wagon-house, and carried it out to the sign-post {{in the front of the}} house. It was raining, gently, during these performances, but we had on our old clothes, and were so much interested in our work that we did not care for a little rain. I carried the sign to the post, and then, at the imminent risk <b>of</b> breaking <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> I hung it on its appropriate hooks on the transverse beam of the sign-post. Now our tavern was really what it pretended to be. We gazed on the sign with admiration and content.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} he says," [...] the girl answered, her face sullen and weary again. [...] "He and all of you have no regard for me. You pretend to have, but you are all willing to {{sacrifice}} me to prove a theory. I don't care whether spiritualism is true or not, I want to have one single day when I {{can be sure of}} being myself, free to come and go like other girls. I feel as if I had a band <b>of</b> iron around <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> I shall go mad with it some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{go in to}} respectable {{jewellers}} {{they ask}} me to wait, and go and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot wait. And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply stuck to the one I gave him {{and told me to}} prosecute if I wanted it back. I am going about now with several hundred thousand pounds-worth <b>of</b> diamonds round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and without either food or shelter. You are the first person I have taken into my confidence. But I like your face and I am hard-driven." ...|$|R
60|$|I have a {{plan for}} my own bedroom. I spend long hours in bed, reading, studying, and working. I have tried {{sleeping}} in the open, but the lamp attracts all the creeping, crawling, butting, flying, fluttering things to the pages of my book, into my ears and blankets, and down the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> So my bedroom shall be indoors.|$|E
6000|$|Leland laughed, {{though his}} eyes were half closed. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "I'll be round again to-morrow all right. It was as hot as I ever {{remember}} it this afternoon, and each time I came down the long stretch with the binder the sun was on the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> I just want to sit still a little and cool off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Den I felt at der back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> der {{fingers of}} Bimi. Mein Gott! I tell you dot he talked through dose fingers. It was der deaf-and-dumb {{alphabet}} all gomplete. He slide his hairy arm round my neck, und he tilt up my chin und looked into my face, shust {{to see if}} I understood his talk so well as he understood mine.|$|E
50|$|Item I {{give and}} {{bequeath}} unto my Son Henry Bonner the one half <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> land lying back of and adjoining to Washington {{the same to}} be split or divided by a line beginning on the back line of the Sd (said) Town of Washington and so running back to my back line. Also I give to my son Henry the one half of a certain Tract or parcel of land lying in Pitt County and adjoining where my old Quarter Plantation is with the half of the Mill of Mr Peter Floyd. Also two small surveys of land in Beaufort County adjoining Col Jno Kennedy, Mr Wilson, Peter Floyd and Henry Bonner. My negro Boy Winsor my negro Woman Jane my Negro man Will. Two Lotts in Washington N 44 & N 38 one sorrel mare and one buckskin horse to him his heirs forever.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, Drummond was {{involved}} in a controversial exhibition at the deconsecrated St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool. Drummond contributed a guestbook which asked visitors [...] "Is God a Cunt?". It was later reported that the artwork had been stolen and a £1000 reward offered for its return. Drummond himself said that he would answer [...] "no" [...] to his own question: [...] "God is responsible for all the things I love, the speckles on a brown trout; the sound of Angus Young's guitar, the nape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend's <b>neck,</b> the song of the blackcap when he returns in Spring. I never blame God for all the shit, for the baby Rwandan slaughtered in a casual genocide, the ever-present wars, drudgery and misery that fills most of our lives." ...|$|R
40|$|Those two {{pit bulls}} playing {{out on the}} street belong to that pink house right across from mine. A mother, son and {{daughter}} live there, too, more ink on their six fat arms than the bumper Sunday paper. I don 2 ̆ 7 t want to think about what they might have put over the rest of themselves. No, I 2 ̆ 7 m not judging people by their cover. I got a tattoo, my very own constellation of stars. The most stars that could fit onto the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> little <b>neck.</b> I always was skinny. Bones like a fish, some men said. Bones, my first husband said, that he could pick from between his teeth. I never did feel there was enough of me, especially not after all he took out of me...|$|R
