5|$|There are {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther {{out at the}} outer edge of the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E
5|$|For Kinkladze, {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season {{followed}} a similar pattern to the previous season, comprising a mixture <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> and substitute appearances. Jim Smith resigned from his managerial position at Derby on 7 October 2001, leaving Kinkladze, a Smith favourite, bitterly disappointed. The appointment of new manager Colin Todd signalled a change in the club's playing style. Todd did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd's first two months in charge. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took the unusual step of using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team. Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy. According to Kinkladze's agent, Manchester City, as well as Spanish clubs Valencia, Mallorca and Málaga, were all interested in signing Kinkladze. However, Todd was sacked on 14 January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League, and John Gregory was appointed as manager on 30 January 2002. Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation {{for the third time in}} his career. The club, who were £35 million in debt, started an end-of-season clear-out to reduce their annual £17 million wage bill. Derby's actions included off-loading of some of the highest earners, and the manager informed Kinkladze that he had no future at the club. However, Kinkladze, whose contract ended in summer 2003, was reluctant to leave the club and turned down a move to Turkish champions Galatasaray.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010–11 Australian summer, Smith played three Tests in the 2010–11 Ashes series, {{this time}} playing {{more as a}} batsman, taking the number six spot in the order. His {{performances}} were solid during the series, getting a number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> and scoring two half centuries. Following the 2010–11 Ashes, Smith did not play another Test for two years, his next Test series coming against India in March 2013.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 196061 season, Burge again found himself outside the Test team. He made a series <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in four matches for Queensland, {{reaching}} 15 in all eight innings but only managing two half-centuries with a top-score of 75. This changed in two fixtures over the Christmas and New Year period. He struck 240 in a ten-wicket win over South Australia and then made 103 and 55 in a low-scoring two-wicket win over Western Australia, scoring over 38% of his team's runs.|$|E

25|$|This {{earned him}} a lucrative move to Premier League side Coventry City for a fee of £500,000. However his chances at Highfield Road were limited and after making only 7 {{appearances}} plus a loan spell at Fulham he moved to Stoke City in February 1998. He didn't get off to the best <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> with Stoke as he struggled with illness and form as Stoke suffered relegation from the First Division in 1997–98. He improved in 1998–99, netting eight goals. In 1999–2000 Lightbourne scored 10 goals in 52 appearances as Stoke reached the play-offs where they lost to Gillingham. He played in the 2000 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley as Stoke beat Bristol City 2–1. In 2000–01 he found his chances of first team football more restricted but still managed five goals in 28 appearances. In {{the latter part of}} the season he spent spells on loan at Swindon Town and Cardiff City.|$|E
25|$|Mansell's {{skill as}} a test driver, {{including}} setting the fastest lap around Silverstone in a Lotus car at the time, impressed Chapman enough {{to give him a}} trio <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in F1 in , driving a development version of the Lotus 81 used by the team, the Lotus 81B. In his Formula One debut at the 1980 Austrian Grand Prix, a fuel leak in the cockpit that developed shortly {{before the start of the}} race left him with painful first and second degree burns on his buttocks. An engine failure forced him to retire from that race and his second, however an accident at his third event at Imola meant he failed to qualify. Team leader Mario Andretti wrote his car off in a start-line accident during the Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal, so Mansell had to give up his car for Andretti to compete in for his home race, the final race of the season at Watkins Glen in the United States. Andretti announced he was leaving to move to Alfa Romeo at the end of the season leaving Lotus with a vacant race seat.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the rather}} interim {{nature of its}} engine and chassis configuration, on its World Championship debut at the 1964 Monaco Grand Prix the BRM P261 had the best <b>of</b> <b>starts.</b> Although Hill and team-mate Richie Ginther only managed to qualify in third and eighth places, respectively, in the race Hill set fastest lap, and the two P261s {{finished}} first and second. It {{was the first of}} Hill's five victories on the Côte d'Azure. Hill continued to perform well throughout {{the first half of the}} season, and took a string of three back-to-back second places in France, Britain and Germany. Ironically, it was with the introduction of the proper, high-exhaust version of the engine in Italy that the car's reliability began to falter. At Monza Hill qualified on the front row of the grid, but as he sat waiting for the flag to drop his clutch seized open, and his car sat stationary as the rest of the field streamed past him. Hill bounced back to win in the United States, but finished out of the points at the season finale in Mexico following a collision with Bandini. With reasonable results from Ginther, BRM finished the season second in the Constructors' Championship, with Hill also second in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

25|$|Gambhir {{scored two}} {{successive}} double-hundreds in 2002 (one of {{them against the}} visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in the home series against Pakistan in 2005, but {{was able to make}} only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests.|$|E
25|$|Allegations of {{cheating}} reignited at the French Grand Prix, when, starting from {{third on the}} grid Schumacher overtook both of the Williams drivers, Damon Hill and Nigel Mansell, leading into the first corner of the race. This raised suspicions, once again, that Benetton were using traction control. There were also incidents involving other teams, notably Ferrari and McLaren. While commentating on the race for Eurosport with John Watson and Allard Kalff, Williams driver David Coulthard, who was replaced by Mansell for the race, stated that Schumacher's start {{reminded him of the}} type <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> from the 1993 season when traction control was legal. Hill was on pole position for the British Grand Prix after qualifying fastest. During the parade lap {{on the way to the}} starting grid, Schumacher, starting second, illegally overtook Hill. As a result of his illegal maneuver, Schumacher was given a five-second penalty at 14:27 local time, 27minutes after the original incident. Schumacher never came into the pit lane to serve the penalty when originally given the penalty, and on lap21, Schumacher was given the black flag. Schumacher stayed out on the circuit while Benetton team boss Briatore, along with Benetton technical director Tom Walkinshaw went to discuss it with Race Director Roland Bruynseraede, arguing that they had not been properly informed of the punishment given. Schumacher eventually served the time penalty on lap27, finishing the race in second position behind Hill.|$|E
25|$|With that, England's {{lead was}} set at 467, necessitating a record-breaking innings from New Zealand {{if they were to}} win the game. Realistically, with heavy weather {{expected}} on the final day, their only hope was to hold out for a draw. However, they still had the best part of five sessions to negotiate to do so, and the loss of Fulton (5) to Broad in the eighth over was not the best <b>of</b> <b>starts.</b> Swann then claimed the wickets of Williamson (3) and Rutherford (42) before the tea break. New Zealand lost three more {{before the end of the}} day; Brownlie (25) went first to Finn after a 79-run stand with Taylor, who made a valuable 70 before he and Guptill were dismissed by Swann as the day drew to a close with New Zealand still 309 behind on 158, with just four wickets in hand. The weather on the final day was as expected, with rain delaying the start by 45 minutes. It was only delaying the inevitable, however, as Broad caught McCullum off his own bowling in the third full over of the day, and Swann broke up a 56-run partnership between Southee and Bracewell, tempting Southee into an edge to slip for his 15th Test five-for before another bout of rain forced an early lunch. Swann got his 10th wicket of the match shortly after the resumption of play, dismissing Bracewell for 19, before Anderson wrapped up the victory and the series with the wicket of Boult for a 24-ball duck.|$|E

500|$|As the 1957 Cleveland Indians season neared, tension {{was running}} high. There was talk about Houtteman's being [...] "in the doghouse", {{or out of}} favor with the team's management, during the 1956 season due to his lack <b>of</b> <b>starts.</b> According to sportswriter Hal Lebovitz, this {{was a result of}} the {{starting}} five for the Indians, including spot starter Feller, pitching very well during spring training. Houtteman was again brought up in trade rumors, along with Mike Garcia, since the Indians were loaded with pitching talent. When manager Al López was replaced by Kerby Farrell, Houtteman did, in fact, land in Farrell's doghouse. Farrell called him out front of his teammates after a poor performance in spring training. Houtteman pitched only four innings in three games for the Indians in 1957.|$|E
500|$|He did not leave, and in February, Clark {{publicly}} criticised him {{for producing}} [...] "possibly the worst training session {{in terms of}} a professional footballer I have ever come across", despite knowing he was due to start the upcoming game against Watford. Up until this incident, he had scored six league goals at a rate of one every 165 minutes, and been sent off twice. Clark said that Žigić would not be involved against Watford, but that it was [...] "in his hands" [...] as to whether he would prepare properly for the Sheffield Wednesday fixture three days later. His response must have been acceptable, because he played the whole of the goalless draw against Wednesday, started all the remaining matches– the longest run <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> of his Birmingham career– and ended the season with nine league goals, second only to King.|$|E

On his 200th league appearance, Henry scored in either half, with the result 5–1 to Arsenal. The result was somewhat overshadowed by the foreign makeup of the team; former player Paul Merson called it a [...] "joke" [...] and PFA chairman Gordon Taylor noted it was a [...] "worrying pattern for English football".

500|$|On January 29, 2009, Uribe {{signed a}} minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. It was {{announced}} on April 4 that Uribe had made the Giants final roster as a utility player. Uribe wound up making a lot <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> at second base, shortstop, and third base throughout the season. On July 10, Uribe bobbled a ground ball with one out {{in the eighth inning}} of Jonathan Sánchez's no-hitter against San Diego, allowing Chase Headley to reach first base. The effort had been perfect up to that point, and Sánchez went on to retire each of the remaining five batters, meaning this error lost the first perfect game since Randy Johnson 's in 2004. This was the first no-hit, no-walk, no–hit batsman game that was not also a perfect game since Terry Mulholland's no-hitter in 1990. In 122 games (398 at-bats), Uribe batted [...]289 (his highest average since 2001) with 115 hits, 26 doubles, 16 home runs, and 55 RBIs.|$|E
500|$|During {{the same}} time frame as the Hitchcock rumors, goaltender Curtis Sanford {{returned}} from his groin injury on November 13. He made his first {{start of the season}} against the Boston Bruins, losing 2–1 in a shootout. Sanford continued his strong play, posting a 3–1–2 record, 1.38 goals against average and [...]947 save percentage over his next six games. Sanford started 12 consecutive games before Steve Mason made his next start. The number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> might not have been as numerous, but prior to the November 23 game, Mason was hit in the head by a shot from Rick Nash during pre-game warm-ups and suffered a concussion. Mason returned from his concussion after two games, making a start against the Vancouver Canucks. Mason allowed only one goal in the game despite suffering from cramping in the third period, temporarily being replaced by Sanford for just over three minutes. Columbus won the game 2–1 in a shootout, breaking a nine-game losing streak to the Canucks. After the game, Arniel stated that Sanford was still seen as the team's number one goaltender. However, Mason started four of the next six games with the Blue Jackets going 0–5–1 during that stretch.|$|E
500|$|The break, and challenge, that Hextall was {{afforded by}} McLennan's call-up {{helped him to}} recover his form, and in February, he made {{consecutive}} shutouts against the Ottawa Senators and Washington Capitals. He recorded another shutout in his next home game, against the Flyers, and was shortly thereafter named as the NHL's player of the week. [...] During the regular season with the Islanders, Hextall recorded a career-best five shutouts, and a GAA of3.08, the best since his rookie year. Maloney described Hextall's time with the team as having [...] "a slow start and a disastrous finish". The Islanders reached the playoffs, but were swept 4–0 by their rivals, the New York Rangers. Hextall played {{three of the four}} games, conceding 16goals for a GAA of6.08, the worst average of his NHL career by some distance. After the season had concluded, Maloney said that he believed that only two Islanders players had distinguished themselves during the 1993–94 season, with one of those being Jamie McLennan. He also praised Hextall's play during his long sequence <b>of</b> <b>starts,</b> but five months later, Maloney traded Hextall back to Philadelphia. He described the move as being two-pronged: it would appease the fans and prevent the derisory calls when the team were struggling, and it would give McLennan a chance to establish himself as the number-one goaltender. Hextall, along with a sixth round draft pick was traded to the Flyers in return for goaltender Tommy Söderström.|$|E
