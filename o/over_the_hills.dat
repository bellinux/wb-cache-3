5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hills</b> and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hills</b> and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E

5|$|Due to her {{commitment}} to the band, Turunen {{was not able to}} concentrate sufficiently on her schoolwork and her academic studies were interrupted. In 1998, Nightwish published their second album, Oceanborn. This album lacked the earlier elements of folk and ambient music, and instead focused on fast, melodic keyboard and guitar lines and Turunen's dramatic voice. In addition to the Oceanborn Europe Tour (1999), Turunen sang solo in Waltari's rock-themed ballet Evankeliumi (also known as Evangelicum) in several sold-out performances at the Finnish National Opera. In 2000 and 2001, Nightwish recorded Wishmaster and <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hills</b> and Far Away and toured Europe and South America (the Wishmaster World Tour). During the Wishmaster World Tour, Turunen met Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli whom she married in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Wales has a {{maritime}} climate, {{the predominant}} winds being southwesterlies and westerlies blowing {{in from the}} Atlantic Ocean. This means that the weather in Wales is in general mild, cloudy, wet and windy. The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in amounts of sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Rainfall in Wales varies widely, with the highest average annual totals in Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons, and the lowest near the coast and in the east, close to the English border. Throughout Wales, the winter months are significantly wetter than the summer ones. Snow is comparatively rare near sea level in Wales, but much more frequent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> and the uplands experience harsher conditions in winter than the more low-lying parts.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the North Koreans {{intensified}} {{their attack}} on the 2nd Battalion on the road southwest of Yongdong. Concentrated artillery support, with the shells falling {{so close to the}} 2nd Battalion positions that they wounded four US troops, together with an attack by the 2nd Battalion, briefly opened the North Korean roadblock at 04:30 July 25, and the bulk of the battalion escaped to Yongdong. However, F Company of the 8th Cavalry, the 16th Reconnaissance Company, and the 1st Platoon of A Company, 71st Tank Battalion, {{at the rear of the}} column were cut off. Only four of 11 light tanks broke through the North Korean positions. Crews abandoned the other seven tanks and walked <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> in a two days' journey as part of a group of 219 men, most of them from F Company. All equipment except individual arms was abandoned by this group. Others groups of US troops escaped in the same manner. The North Koreans had flanked the 1st Cavalry Division in a double envelopment and forced them to withdraw. In the process, the division lost much of its equipment in its quick withdrawal actions.|$|E

25|$|Two 1968 390 V8 Ford Mustang GT Fastbacks (325hp) with four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were used}} for the chase scene, both lent by the Ford Motor Company to Warner Bros. as part of a promotional agreement. The Mustangs' engines, brakes and suspensions were heavily modified for the chase by veteran car racer Max Balchowsky. Ford also originally lent two Galaxie sedans for the chase scenes, but the producers found the cars too heavy for the jumps <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> of San Francisco. They were replaced with two 1968 375hp 440 Magnum V8-powered Dodge Chargers. The engines in both Chargers were left largely unmodified, but the suspensions were mildly upgraded to cope with the demands of the stunt work.|$|E
25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up.

After Nightwish's last gig for the <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hills</b> and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E

25|$|Air raids by the EEF {{were carried}} out during the night of 1/2 November when twelve bombs were dropped on Gaza. On 3 and 4 November air raids were made <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> north of Beersheba. By 6 November it was {{reported}} that Ottoman hospitals were seen being moved back indicating the beginnings of a general retreat towards Mejdel which was also bombed by aircraft. Bombs were also dropped on the main positions behind the Kauwukah defences, near Um Ameidat, on Gaza and on shelters west of Sheria, and three aerial combats were fought against three hostile aircraft. During this time German aircraft had rarely been seen, but that afternoon two R.E.8s and two B.E.12.a aircraft from No. 1 Squadron on photography patrol were attacked by four Albatros aircraft and badly damaged. While a German aircraft was shot down in flames near the Wadi Hesi.|$|E
25|$|His {{repertoire}} exploited {{his firm}} and powerful voice, {{and several of}} his songs became popular favourites. Although most renowned for his comic-patriotic ballad The Roast Beef of Old England, and above all for his setting of John Gay's lyric of Black Eyed Susan, others are lover's complaints or addresses, anacreontics, hunting songs (notably The sweet rosy morning peeps <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills),</b> fairy songs, dramatic pieces, and the like, to the number of more than 150. In addition to A New Book of Songs 1697 and A Second Book of Songs 1699, and A New Book of Songs 1711, further volumes were printed in 1727 and 1728. A number of the 1727 songs are settings of words by Abraham Cowley. Some songs written no doubt for his own performance contain roulades and word-painting, giving an impression of his vocal range and flexibility, and some have recitatives or short sections of part-writing, introducing dramatic structure into the context of concise set-pieces.|$|E
25|$|The fictional {{history of}} Westeros {{stretches}} back some twelve thousand years. The Ice and Fire story {{can be considered}} to be set in a post-magic world where people no longer believe in dragons and the Others. The characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but the magical elements like the Others are not within their understanding. Coming from an impoverished family background of former wealth, Martin always felt attracted to stories of fallen civilizations and lost empires. The lost empire of Valyria in Ice and Fire was once a high civilization similar to Rome before the Dark Ages. These elements may give the story a poignant sadness. The Wall, which Martin believes to be unique in fantasy, was inspired by Martin's visit to Hadrian's Wall in the North of England close to the border with Scotland. Looking out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> Martin wondered what a Roman centurion from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north. The size, length and magical powers of the wall were adjusted for genre demands. Similarly the Titan, an extremely large statue in the city of Braavos, is comparable to the real life Colossus of Rhodes.|$|E
