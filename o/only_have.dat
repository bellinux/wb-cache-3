5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may <b>only</b> <b>have</b> open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|Because {{athletes in}} Ivy League {{competition}} <b>only</b> <b>have</b> {{four years of}} athletic eligibility, Cabral could not participate in NCAA competition for Princeton to use his final year of cross country eligibility. As a result, he intended to enroll in business school at the University of Colorado, where he would continue training with Billy Nelson coach Mark Wetmore. He opted to turn pro rather than attend Colorado.|$|E

5|$|Bradley Pierce as Chip – Mrs. Potts' son, who {{has been}} turned into a teacup. Originally {{intended}} to <b>only</b> <b>have</b> one line, the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce's performance and expanded the character's role significantly, eschewing a mute Music Box character. Pruiksma also served as the supervising animator for Chip.|$|E

5|$|I {{believe that}} my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse ("The Murderess"), is an {{exceptional}} piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not <b>only</b> <b>have</b> the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money.|$|E

5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> been made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> taken place in 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Most weekend SLE trains {{also run}} local {{westbound}} in the morning, then express in the afternoon, stopping only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street. Eastbound service is reversed. This is because Branford, Madison, and Clinton <b>only</b> <b>have</b> platforms on the eastbound track, and thus switching {{is needed to}} platform a westbound train.|$|E
5|$|Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored {{multiple}} first-class {{centuries in}} their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 with the ball. As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, {{as well as}} both left and right-arm seamers, this also meant that he could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> two fast bowlersLindwall and Milleras three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> a single funnel {{to allow the}} guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E

5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with asymptomatic hematuria may <b>only</b> <b>have</b> focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation.

5|$|There is {{no sexual}} dimorphism. Juveniles {{are very similar}} to adults, but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} on the chest.

5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales <b>only</b> <b>have</b> been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses to {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
