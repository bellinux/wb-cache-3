5|$|Functionalism was {{formulated}} by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor {{as a reaction}} to the inadequacies of the identity theory. Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory of the mind. At about the same time or slightly after, D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles. Finally, Wittgenstein's idea <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman. Another one, psychofunctionalism, is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.|$|E

5|$|Around 1924 Whorf {{first became}} {{interested}} in linguistics.

Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya {{have been described as}} exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.|$|E

5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, Putnam {{is known for}} his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. In {{philosophy of}} language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a famous thought experiment called Twin Earth.|$|E

50|$|These {{grammatical}} systems {{play a role}} in the construal <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> different kinds. This is {{the basis}} of Halliday's claim that language is metafunctionally organised. He argues that the raison d'être <b>of</b> language is <b>meaning</b> in social life, and for this reason all languages have three kinds of semantic components. All languages have resources for construing experience (the ideational component), resources for enacting humans' diverse and complex social relations (the interpersonal component), and resources for enabling these two kinds <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> to come together in coherent text (the textual function). Each of the grammatical systems proposed by Halliday are related to these metafunctions. For instance, the grammatical system of 'mood' is considered to be centrally related to the expression <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>meanings,</b> 'process type' to the expression <b>of</b> experiential <b>meanings,</b> and 'theme' to the expression <b>of</b> textual <b>meanings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{outcomes of}} a quantitative psychotechnological {{research on the}} process of one's comprehension of his/her own life. It focuses on the reflective mechanisms <b>of</b> realizing <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> life, thus further developing research on <b>meaning</b> formations <b>of</b> personality within the culturalactivity approach. For these purposes a method of solving the task <b>of</b> finding the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> a dream was used in the study, which is in fact an operationalization of the method of productive amplification of consciousness. Rather than examining the already formed contents <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> life available for introspective descriptions, this method allows the exploration of the constructive activity of consciousness through which these <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> life are formed. The main outcome is the reconstruction and empirical model of reflective activity carried out by the individual in the process <b>of</b> comprehending <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> life and his/her life situatio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking are highly predictive of smoking in middle school children. Three factors <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking have been suggested in the literature: personal meanings, functional meanings, and social meanings. These conceptually derived factors <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking have not previously been empirically studied. Purpose: This study examined the factor structure <b>of</b> the <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> Smoking Index (MSI) to determine the unique contribution <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking and positive outcome expectancies to smoking behavior in middle school children. Methods: A multiethnic sample of 2, 247 eighth-grade students enrolled in 24 middle schools in greater Los Angeles completed a paper-and-pencil survey in class. Results: Four factors of the MSI emerged (functional, personal, social image, and weight concern). Positive outcome expectancies and each of the four factors of the MSI predicted lifetime smoking in a multivariate model. Conclusions: <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking were empirically distinct from positive outcome expectancies. Adolescents who endorsed personal and functional meanings were more likely to smoke. Social image and weight concern meanings were negatively related to smoking after controlling for all other <b>meanings.</b> <b>Meanings</b> <b>of</b> smoking may prove to be important and modifiable mediators of smoking and therefore useful in future prevention studies...|$|R

5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E
5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> and economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound {{had just begun}} his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E

5|$|When it {{was first}} raised, an {{auxiliary}} regiment would have been recruited from the native tribe or people whose name it bore. In the early Julio-Claudian period, it seems that {{efforts were made to}} preserve the ethnic integrity of units, even when the regiment was posted in a faraway province. But in the later part of the period, recruitment in the region where the regiment was posted increased and became predominant from the Flavian era onwards. The regiment would thus lose its original ethnic identity. The unit's name would thus become a mere curiosity devoid <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> although some of its members might inherit foreign names from their veteran ancestors. This view has to be qualified, however, as evidence from military diplomas and other inscriptions shows that some units continued to recruit in their original home areas e.g. Batavi units stationed in Britain, where some units had an international membership. It also appears that the Danubian provinces (Raetia, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia) remained key recruiting grounds for units stationed all over the empire.|$|E
