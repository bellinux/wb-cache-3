5000|$|Inaugurated as the <b>Oak</b> <b>Tree</b> Stakes in 1969, from 1971 through 1995 it {{was called}} the <b>Oak</b> <b>Tree</b> Invitational Stakes, and from 1996 through 1999, the <b>Oak</b> <b>Tree</b> Turf Championship Stakes.

5|$|The fruit bodies grow in {{clusters}} or {{scattered on the}} decomposing leaves and acorns of <b>oak</b> <b>trees,</b> such as Coast Live Oak, Valley Oak and Black Oak. It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it appears from late autumn to early winter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the city of Berkeley, California.

5|$|Amanita ocreata, {{commonly}} known as the death angel, destroying angel, angel of death or more precisely western North American destroying angel, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita.

Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black <b>oak</b> <b>trees.</b> By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

5|$|Oak savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered <b>oak</b> <b>trees,</b> {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set fires in the oak savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific gopher snake live in the oak savanna region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, violet-green swallow, acorn woodpecker, black-headed grosbeak, and American kestrel {{have also}} been found in this region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit.

5|$|The Cummer Gardens are 1.45 {{acres of}} {{historic}} gardens {{made up of}} native Florida plants, large live <b>oak</b> <b>trees,</b> {{and a number of}} reflecting pools, fountains, ornaments and sculptures.

Ninah Cummer adopted the lion as her personal motif, and lion details can be found all over the gardens.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} habitat in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this habitat include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak.

Lower to the ground are huckleberry, teaberry, blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this habitat include wild onion and wild strawberries.|$|E
5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or scattered {{on the ground in}} mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by <b>oak</b> <b>trees)</b> in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A predilection for disturbed soil, such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent investigations have shown it to be common in oak forests in the eastern United States. The southern end of its distribution extends to Sonora, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Bothia is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Boletaceae. A {{monotypic}} genus, it contains the single species Bothia castanella, a bolete mushroom first described scientifically in 1900 from collections made in New Jersey. Found in the eastern United States, Costa Rica, China, and Taiwan, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with <b>oak</b> <b>trees.</b> Its fruit body is chestnut brown, the cap is smooth and dry, and {{the underside of the}} cap has radially elongated tubes. The spore deposit is yellow-brown. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown. Historically, its unique combination of morphological features resulted in the transfer of B.castanella to six different Boletaceae genera. Molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2007, demonstrated that the species was genetically unique enough to warrant placement in its own genus.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus rubroflammeus from similar boletes include the deep purple-red cap and the reticulated stem. B.flammans {{is similar in}} appearance, but has a more variable cap color, ranging from dark red to brick-red or reddish-brown, a yellow stem base and less prominently reticulate stem, and it grows under conifers. Rubroboletus rhodosanguineus is also very similar but has more variable cap color with brown to olive tones and its cut flesh has an odor of overripe fruit that intensifies when dry. The European species R.rhodoxanthus has a paler overall color. Another European species, B.permagnificus, has larger spores (13–16 by 5–6.5μm), weakly decurrent pores, and only associates with <b>oak</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Edward Seymour {{fell from}} power in 1549, {{and after his}} removal a new survey {{was carried out by}} Captain William Tyrell, in part to confirm that the new fortifications were {{suitably}} located across the islands. Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 <b>oak</b> <b>trees</b> from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552.|$|E
