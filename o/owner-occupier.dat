2500|$|The Tenant {{features}} numerous {{allusions to}} a wide range of other texts, from the Bible to contemporary novels. Apart from being used as a quotation, allusions are often applied by peculiar characters to reflect their personalities. Sometimes the individual voices of characters are shown as a patchwork of quotations. Such [...] "borrowed voices" [...] denote the displacement of the main heroes – Gilbert, being a well-educated man with high ambitions for some [...] "great achievements", is forced to take over his father’s farm, and Helen, being a runaway wife, can call neither her home nor her name her own. Josephine McDonagh believes that the theme of displacement is underlined by the title of the novel: Helen is tenant, not an <b>owner-occupier,</b> of Wildfell Hall, the place of her birth, which was bequeathed to a male descendant, her brother. The emphasis on allusion in the novel, on using the language of others, according to McDonagh, may be a reflection on the position of being a tenant, which in its subjugation is similar to that of being a wife.|$|E

While estimating housing consumption for tenants amounts to observing rents, estimating housing consumption for <b>owner-occupiers</b> is challenging because it is not directly observable and interest payments vary with re-paid principals. In order to examine the housing consumption for <b>owner-occupiers,</b> this article combines micro data sets on income and imputed rents for <b>owner-occupiers</b> based on home attributes from a consumer expenditure survey and monthly rents in a rental survey.

50|$|The 24% of {{dwellings}} {{which are}} rented by private landlords {{may be considered}} income-producing or investment properties, and the private landlords as investors, though some owner-occupiers may also view their dwellings as investments. The main {{difference is that the}} rent paid by a tenant is income of the landlord-investor, while an <b>owner-occupier</b> does not generally derive any income from the property. Similarly, the investor can claim expenses relating to the property, including property taxes, interest and depreciation, which the <b>owner-occupier</b> cannot. The rent paid by a tenant for private or domestic purposes is not generally an allowable deduction of the tenant, as are any expenses relating to the property.|$|E

This paper shows how the transaction sequence decision of <b>owner‐occupiers</b> depends on, and in turn, affects housing market conditions in an equilibrium search‐and‐matching model of the housing market. We show that home‐owners prefer to buy first whenever there are more buyers than sellers in the market. This behavior leads to multiple steady state equilibria and to self‐fulfilling fluctuations in prices and time-on‐market. Equilibrium switches creates large fluctuations in the housing market, which are broadly consistent with stylized facts on the housing cycle...|$|R
