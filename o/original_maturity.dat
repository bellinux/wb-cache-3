40|$|Our paper {{explores the}} risks that arise due to {{indebtedness}} of Hungarian local governments. Our analysis relies on interviews conducted with {{the heads of the}} local government business branches of the credit institutions most important in terms of local government financing and on the related data collections, as well as on data from the Hungarian State Treasury regarding the financial management of local governments and on data from banks. Until 2011, the repayment of the bonds issued during the bond issue boom experienced in the local government sector in 2007 – 2008 started only in the case of one third of the bonds outstanding. However, by the end of 2011 year nearly 50 per cent and by end- 2013 90 per cent of total bonds outstanding will reach the principal repayment period. Due to the considerable foreign exchange exposure of total loans and bonds outstanding (60 per cent, 80 per cent of which is Swiss franc exposure) {{as well as to the}} declining revenues of local governments and the deteriorating economic prospects, it is doubtful that local governments will be able to repay their debts to the banking sector in line with the <b>original</b> <b>maturities.</b> Therefore local governments financing may have an effect not only on the fiscal position but on the whole financial system as well. Nevertheless, our partial analysis establishes that the risks related to the debt of the local government sector have increased significantly in the recent period, but these risks could be managed by the banks. The comprehensive restructuring of the local government system as a whole and a further changing of debt settlement procedures by the government may influence the financial position of the local government system. In parallel with the regrouping of tasks, transferring of a portion of local government debt (primarily from the county local governments) to the central budget may result in a clear picture. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{describe}} {{the change of}} purchasing moving from administrative to strategic function academics have put forward maturity models which help practitioners to compare their purchasing activities to industry top performers and best practices. However, none of the models aim to distinguish the purchasing maturity from the after-sales point of view, even though after-sales activities are acknowledged as a relevant source of revenue, profit and competitive advantage in most manufacturing firms. The maturity of purchasing and supply management practices have a large impact to the overall performance of the spare parts supply chain and ultimately to the value creation and relationship building for the end customer. The research was done {{as a case study}} for a European after-sales organization which is part of a globally operating industrial firm specialized in heavy machinery. The study mapped {{the current state of the}} purchasing practices in the case organization and also distinguished the relevant areas for future development. The study was based on the purchasing maturity model developed by Schiele (2007) and investigated also how applicable is the maturity model in the spare parts supply chain context. Data for the assessment was gathered using five expert interviews inside the case organization and other parties involved in the company’s spare parts supply chain. Inventory management dimension was added to the <b>original</b> <b>maturity</b> model in order to better capture the important areas in a spare parts supply chain. The added five questions were deduced from the spare parts management literature and verified as relevant areas by the case organization’s personnel. Results indicate that largest need for development in the case organization are: better collaboration between sourcing and operative procurement functions, use of installed base information in the spare parts management, training plan development for new buyers, assessment of aligned KPI’s between the supply chain parties and better defining the role of after-sales sourcing. The purchasing maturity model used in this research worked well in H&R Leading, Controlling and Inventory Management dimensions. The assessment was more difficult to conduct in the Supplier related processes, Process integration and Organizational structure –dimensions, mainly because the assessment in these sections would for some parts require more company-wide assessment. Results indicate also that the purchasing maturity model developed by Schiele (2007) captures the relevant areas in the spare parts supply as well...|$|E

40|$|Poland is {{considered}} the most prospective country for shale gas production in Europe. Hydrocarbon generation/expulsion scenarios, drawn in the latest intensive exploration phases, tend to overestimate maturation levels when compared with brand new data acquired after recent drillings. We tested an integrated workflow to correlate published and <b>original</b> thermal <b>maturity</b> datasets for the Paleozoic to Jurassic successions cropping out in the Holy Cross Mountains. These successions, when preserved in subsurface, host the major source rocks in the area. The application of the workflow allowed us to highlight the burial and thermal evolutionary scenarios of the two tectono-stratigraphic blocks of the Holy Cross Mountains (Łysogory and Kielce blocks) and to propose this approach {{as a tool for}} reducing levels of uncertainty in thermal maturity assessment of Paleozoic successions worldwide. In particular, published datasets including colour alteration indexes of Paleozoic microfossils (conodont, acritarchs) and vitrinite and graptolite reflectance data, show differences in levels of thermal maturity for the Łysogory (mid mature to overmature) and Kielce (immature to late mature) blocks. Original data, derived from optical analysis, pyrolysis, and Raman spectroscopy on kerogen, and X-Ray diffraction on fine grained sediments, mostly confirm and integrate published data distribution. 1 D thermal models, constrained by these data, show burial and exhumation events of different magnitude, during the Late Cretaceous, for the Łysogory (maximum burial depths of 9 km) and Kielce (burial depths of 6 km) blocks that have been related to the Holy Cross Fault polyphase activity.

40|$|The {{following}} is an <b>original</b> screenplay about <b>Maturity</b> set {{in the mode of}} a Summer Romance. It is structured like the classic Joseph Campbell Monomyth. However, it offers a commentary on the unchanging nature of people by utilizing non-linear storytelling and inverting the typical hero’s journey narrative by having the protagonist end up, more or less, where he began. Key moments and story beats are taken from classic hero’s journeys and refashioned to fit the scale and time periods. Collin Williams does not cross the threshold into a magical new land but instead into the fantastical realm of Rock and Roll, he does not vanquish his foe by the sword, and he does not save a beautiful maiden, but the story is structured so that these events are adapted into their more logical real world parallels. All the while he is tempted by his love interest Liz and belittled by the “too cool for school” Billy James. Characters are molded from universal archetypes including the sage, jester, warrior, and king. Each has an arc that illuminates how these one dimensional approaches to life come into conflict with maturity. The screenplay takes advantage of the multi-tiered method of storytelling unique to cinema through heavy and deliberate inclusion of specific sounds and music. Repeated visual motifs and symbols also feature prominently with references to other revered journeys of self discovery and lifestyle philosophies...|$|R
40|$|Extinction, the {{irreversible}} loss of species, {{is perhaps}} the most alarming symptom of the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Some of the most significant changes in evolution throughout Earth’s history have coincided with extinction boundary events. In this thesis various organic geochemical (biomarker and stable isotopes) and geological (sedimentology and palaeontology) approaches have been undertaken to examine {{one of the most significant}} mass extinction events that occurred during the Late Permian (252 My ago) near to the Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary. In the marine realm 49 % of invertebrate families became extinct (equivalent to 80 – 96 % of species loss). However, identifying an ecological crisis and associated extinction interval in any given extinction boundary section can often be difficult. Many different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the end-Permian extinction. The coincidence in timing of the extinction with the massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia has been established. The release of methane and possibly other gases during the volcanic event could have led to global warming. The oceans were oxygen deficient leading to euxinic conditions (with H[subscript] 2 S as a toxic agent) possibly triggering the extinction. Further, the selectivity of the extinction suggests hypercapnia (high CO[subscript] 2) as a kill mechanism. It is widely accepted that the extinction is a “tangled web of causality” with several mechanisms contributing to the biotic crisis. Analyses of molecular fossils (biomarkers) and their stable isotopic compositions provide an alternative tool for identifying mass extinction intervals complimenting bulk stable isotopic data (δ[superscript] 34 Spyrite, δ[superscript] 13 Ccarbonate, δ[superscript] 13 Corg), sedimentological and fossil record data. Only recently have biomarker abundances (and δ[superscript] 13 C) and changes associated with the end-Permian extinction attracted significant attention. For example, biomarkers ultimately derived from pigments of organisms carrying out anoxygenic photosynthesis (Chlorobiaceae) have been recently reported in several P/Tr sections, providing evidence for widespread photic zone euxinic conditions. The aims of this PhD thesis were (i) to establish the palaeoenvironmental conditions associated with the P/Tr mass extinction event using an integrated biomarker, isotopic (including δD of biomarkers) and sedimentological approach for one section from the northern hemisphere and (ii) to establish whether the biomarker and isotopic signals (including δD of bulk kerogen) observed in several sections from about the globe represent localised environments of deposition and/or are related to global depositional conditions. In Chapter 2 for the first time an integrated study including sedimentological data, biomarker distributions/abundances and selected stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes along with bulk isotopes (δ[superscript] 34 Spyrite, δ[superscript] 13 Ccarbonate, δ[superscript] 13 Corg) for a Late Permian section from Lusitaniadalen, Spitsbergen, Norway has been conducted. These data support a marine transgression and collapse of the marine ecosystem in the Late Permian. Strong evidence for waxing and waning of photic zone euxinic conditions throughout the Late Permian section is provided by Chlorobiaceae-derived biomarkers (including δ[superscript] 13 C data) and δ[superscript] 34 Spyrite, suggesting several events of H[subscript] 2 S outgassing and potentially several pulses of extinction. A rapid decrease in abundance of various land plant biomarkers prior to the marine collapse event suggests a decline in terrestrial organisms during the Late Permian and/or increasing distance from the palaeoshoreline as an effect of sea level rise. Changes in δD of biomarkers also indicate a change in source of OM, microbial diversification and sea level rise. Further, compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) data of algal and land-plant derived biomarkers, δ[superscript] 13 Ccarbonate and δ[superscript] 13 Corg provide strong evidence for synchronous changes in δ[superscript] 13 C of marine and atmospheric CO[subscript] 2, attributed to a [superscript] 13 C-depleted source. The source could either be associated with isotopically depleted methane released from the melting of gas clathrates and/or from respired OM, due to the collapse of the marine ecosystem. In Chapter 3 δD of kerogen (δDkerogen) for three P/Tr sequences (Hovea# 3, Perth Basin, Western Australia; Schuchert Dal section, Jameson’s Land, East Greenland and Lusitaniadalen, Spitsbergen) have been measured and compared with δ[superscript] 34 S of total reduced inorganic sulfur (δ[superscript] 34 Spyrite) of all three sections and for one sample set δ[superscript] 13 C of carbonate (δ[superscript] 13 Ccarbonate) to establish (i) similarities between the sections and (ii) evaluate whether these signals are local or global. Stable isotope shifts occur for all localities either at the P/Tr transition (Western Australia) or coinciding with the marine ecosystem collapse (Spitsbergen and East Greenland). δDkerogen reflects OM/kerogen type. Reliable palaeoenvironmental information in terms of the use of δD can therefore only be obtained for the P/Tr transition from hydrogen compound-specific isotope analyses of biomarkers (Chapter 2). The negative shifts in δ[superscript] 13 Ccarbonate (primary) and δ[superscript] 13 Ckerogen are attributed to the release of [superscript] 13 C-depleted carbon into the atmosphere, whereas the isotopic excursions in δ[superscript] 34 Spyrite relate to global palaeoredox changes. However, the global synchronous shifts in δDkerogen, δ[superscript] 34 Spyrite and δ[superscript] 13 Ckerogen for all sections suggest a relation between the sulfur, carbon and hydrogen cycles. In Chapter 4 the abundances of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) throughout three P/Tr sections from the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) in Meishan (South China), Kap Stosch Area (East Greenland) and Peace River Basin (Western Canada) were evaluated. The PAHs dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran were found to decrease in abundance just before or shortly after the P/Tr boundary in all three sections, supporting the hypotheses of a worldwide decrease in preservation of terrestrial OM. Perylene was observed in high abundance at the onset of the main extinction horizon (at bed 25) in Meishan and has been attributed to a wood degrading fungal source, consistent with the demise of land plants. Frequently occurring forest fire events are also evident from the abundance of several combustion-derived PAHs showing independent patterns in all sections. The coincidence of high abundances of combustion markers occurring simultaneous with ash beds in Meishan section indicates an origin related to the Late Permian and Early Triassic volcanic eruptions in Siberia and China. In Chapter 5 an evaluation of selected biomarker maturity parameters [methylnaphthalene ratio (MNR), methylphenanthrene index (MPI- 1), C 27 diasterane/sterane ratio and Ts/(Ts+Tm) ratio] has been conducted for a number of P/Tr samples (Western Australia, East Greenland and Spitsbergen). Differences in these parameters have been observed between freely extractable bitumens from sedimentary rocks (Bitumen I) and bitumens comprising hydrocarbons closely related to the kerogen/mineral matrix (Bitumen II). Further, a distinct connection between these differences and the clay/TOC ratio of the sediments has been made. The information on thermal maturity that is preserved within Bitumen II could be of significance in petroleum exploration studies, as the <b>original</b> thermal <b>maturity</b> signal of Bitumen I may be overprinted by migrated bitumen...|$|R
