5|$|The United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also {{known as}} the McClellan Committee) was a select {{committee}} created by the United States Senate on January 30, 1957, and dissolved on March 31, 1960. The select committee was directed to study the extent of criminal or other improper practices {{in the field of}} labor-management relations or in groups of employees or employers, and to suggest changes in the laws of the United States that would provide protection against such practices or activities. It conducted 253 active investigations, served 8,000 subpoenas for witnesses and documents, held 270 days of hearings, took testimony from 1,526 witnesses (343 of whom invoked the Fifth Amendment), and compiled almost 150,000 pages <b>of</b> <b>testimony.</b> At the peak of its activity in 1958, 104 persons worked for the committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{injunction}} {{against the}} project forced Alyeska to do further research {{throughout the summer}} of 1970. The collected material {{was turned over to}} the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft environmental impact statement was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages <b>of</b> <b>testimony</b> and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. One element of opposition the report quelled was the discussion of alternatives. All the proposed alternatives—extension of the Alaska Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts {{to make light of}} the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading to the need to pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day <b>of</b> <b>testimony.</b> The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E

5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf. After reiterating Taylor's legal {{claim to the}} office of governor, he answered the question of jurisdiction by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including insufficient time given for the review <b>of</b> <b>testimony</b> provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. Following Bradley's argument, the court recessed until May 14, 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review <b>of</b> <b>testimony</b> provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

40|$|The {{way people}} with mental {{illnesses}} testify and the content <b>of</b> their <b>testimonies</b> are important and interesting issues in law, psychiatry and psychology. While testifying, a mentally ill witness, or a person {{under the influence of}} alcohol or other intoxicants during the incident, causes a problem involving the assessment of their competence as a witness. A psychologist acting as an expert witness is expected to establish this competence in terms of the capability to perceive, store and recreate observations and with regard to the psychological criteria determining the credibility <b>of</b> the <b>testimony.</b> The article reviews psychological indicators determining the credibility <b>of</b> a <b>testimony</b> and then analyses <b>testimonies</b> <b>of</b> mentally ill witnesses. It has been shown that an assessment <b>of</b> <b>testimonies</b> should include indicators regarding the content <b>of</b> a <b>testimony,</b> the motivation for testifying, and the history <b>of</b> a <b>testimony,</b> as well as observational criteria regarding the witness’ emotional and physiological sphere. Based on the presented case studies, an attempt was made to indicate that comparisons and generalizations within the content and form of mentally ill witnesses’ testimonies are possible, but they should be considered with great caution, always including the principle of individualization in diagnostic procedure. The most prevalent characteristics <b>of</b> <b>testimonies</b> <b>of</b> patients with paranoid schizophrenia comprise: prevalence of assertive sentences, lack of structured statements, often lack of logic, occurrence of insignificant details, muddled context, problems with differentiation which contents result from one’s own observations and which from subjective experience, often of paranoid type...|$|R
