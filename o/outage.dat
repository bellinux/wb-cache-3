40|$|Using a {{contingent}} valuation survey, we elicit Swedish households’ {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) to avoid power <b>outages.</b> In the study respondents are asked to state their WTP for avoiding nine different types of <b>outages.</b> We therefore apply a random parameter Tobit model since there is cross-sectional heterogeneity and a proportion of zero responses. Based on the estimations, {{we find that the}} WTP depends positively on the duration of the <b>outages,</b> and that WTP is significantly higher for unplanned <b>outages.</b> The overall variation in the WTP due to observed heterogeneity in housing and socio-economic variables is small compared to the pure effects of power <b>outages.</b> Policy implications of those findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the availability of}} voice over IP (VoIP) service typically achieved in the current Internet. Service availability is examined using several metrics, including call success probability, overall packet loss probability, the proportion of time the network is suitable for VoIP service, and call abortion probability induced by network <b>outages.</b> Our major findings are: first, packet losses are not rare events, and it is generally worse on international paths. Secondly, network <b>outages</b> make up a non-negligible portion of packet losses. While most <b>outages</b> are short, some are extremely long and make up the majority time of all <b>outages.</b> This implies when a service becomes unavailable, the Mean Time To Restore (MTTR) can sometimes be very high. About {{one third of the}} <b>outages</b> happen in symmetry, and <b>outages</b> tend to occur at the edges rather than {{in the middle of the}} network. Thirdly, although research networks such as Internet 2 has much lower delay and loss than the public Internet, the effect of network <b>outages</b> on both types of networks is almost the same. Finally, we will show that when considering calls aborted due to network <b>outages,</b> the overall service availability drops by a significant margin, from about 99. 5 % to 98 %...|$|R
40|$|Understanding network {{reliability}} and <b>outages</b> {{is critical to}} the “health” of the Internet infrastructure. Unfortunately, our ability to analyze Internet <b>outages</b> has been hampered by the lack of access to public information from key players. In this paper, we leverage a somewhat unconventional dataset to analyze Internet reliability—the <b>outages</b> mailing list. The mailing list is an avenue for network operators to share information and insights about widespread <b>outages.</b> Using this unique dataset, we perform a first-of-its-kind longitudinal analysis of Internet <b>outages</b> from 2006 to 2013 using text mining and natural language processing techniques. We observe several interesting aspects of Internet outages: a large number of application and mobility issues that impact users, a rise in content, mobile issues, and discussion of large-scale DDoS attacks in recent years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tandem {{computer}} systems {{are designed to}} be single-fault tolerant. This paper takes a census of customer system <b>outages</b> reported to Tandem. The census shows a clear improvement in the reliability of hardware and maintenance. It indicates that now (1989) software is the majority source of reported system <b>outages</b> (62 %), followed by system operations (15 %). This is a dramatic shift from the statistics in 1985. Even discounting systematic under-reporting of operations and environmental <b>outages,</b> the conclusion is clear: hardware faults and hardware maintenance are no longer a major source of <b>outages.</b> As the other components of the system become increasingly reliable, software necessarily becomes the dominant cause of <b>outages.</b> Achieving higher-availability will require improvements in software quality, and software-fault tolerance, and will require simpler operations, and operations-fault tolerance.

5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power <b>outage</b> cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island. Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new method for incorporating station related <b>outages</b> in composite or bulk system reliability analysis. Station related failures can cause multiple component <b>outages</b> that can propagate to other parts of the network resulting in severe damages. In order to minimize the effects of station related <b>outages</b> on the composite system performance it is necessary for the designer to assess their effects. This task can be achieved by including station related <b>outages</b> in the composite system evaluation. Monte Carlo simulation is used in this research to assess composite system reliability. The new method described in this thesis is used to include station related <b>outages</b> in the reliability evaluation of two composite test systems. This new method is relatively simple and can be used to consider multiple component <b>outages</b> due to station related failures in composite system reliability evaluation. In this approach, the effects of station related <b>outages</b> are combined with the connected terminal failure parameters. Reliability studies conducted on the two composite test systems demonstrates that station failures significantly affect the system performance. The system reliability can be improved by selecting appropriate station configurations. This is illustrated by application to the two composite test systems...|$|R
40|$|Environmental factors, such as weather, trees, and animals, {{are major}} causes of power <b>outages</b> in {{electric}} utility distribution systems.

This paper proposes an ensemble learning approach based on a boosting algorithm, AdaBoost+, for estimation of weather-caused power <b>outages.</b> Effectiveness of the model is evaluated using actual data, which comprised of weather data and recorded <b>outages</b> for four cities of different sizes in Kansas. The proposed ensemble model is compared with previously presented regression, neural network, and mixture of experts models.
