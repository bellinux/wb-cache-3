5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} major {{conflicting}} factions {{present in the}} expansion, all residing in separate areas: the Harbormen of Far Harbor; the synth (synthetic humans) colony of Acadia; and the Church of the Children of Atom. The Harbormen of Far Harbor are led by the town leader, Captain Avery, and seek to reclaim The Island from the fog that has gradually driven them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The Children of Atom live in an old nuclear submarine base called the Nucleus and are led by High Confessor Tektus. Tektus is a fanatical follower of the Church of Atom who seeks to disable or destroy the fog condensers. The refuge for the synth colony of Acadia is an abandoned research center {{at the top of}} The Island; the group are led by a mysterious prototype synth called DiMA. DiMA is friendly to both the Harbormen and the Children so long as Acadia remains autonomous and isolated {{from the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{founding}} of the first Progressive era women's clubs, Sorosis and the New England Women's Club, most organizations for women were auxiliaries of groups for men or were church-related.

25|$|According to Dr. William Shaffir of McMaster University, about 20% of men {{living in}} Kiryas Tosh work {{outside of the}} {{community}}. Those who work outside of the community usually work in either specialized Jewish businesses, as Shochetim (ritual slaughterers) and teachers in religious schools, or in Jewish-owned businesses in the greater Montreal area. The rest of the community work in either religious jobs (at the community synagogue, mikvah, or yeshiva) or own their own small-scale retail businesses <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> (from jewelry making and shatnez laboratories to accounting and insurance agencies).|$|E
25|$|Massport's {{relationship}} with nearby communities has been strained since the mid-1960s, when the agency {{took control of}} a parcel of residential land and popular fishing area near the northwest side of the airfield. This project was undertaken to extend Runway 15R/33L, which later became Logan's longest runway. Residents of the neighborhood, known as Wood Island, were bought <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and forced to relocate. Public opposition {{came to a head}} when residents lay down in the streets to block bulldozers and supply trucks from reaching the construction zone.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1910, {{following}} {{months of}} high rainfall, the River Seine in Paris flooded the French capital, reaching a maximum height of 8.62 metres. The Great Flood of Paris {{as it is}} colloquially known caused extensive damage and forced thousands <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The infrastructure within Paris came close to destruction and there were major concerns for public health. France mobilised to save its capital. Lépine whose office included public health proved as tough and authoritarian {{as he had been}} on policing matters. In the flood's aftermath he established new procedures to address the problems of flooding. The instructions explained the importance of chemical cleansing and institutionalized the growing medical consensus about the causes of water borne diseases that had been controversial just a few years earlier.|$|E

25|$|The pre-war {{houses in}} the {{historic}} centre of George Town was protected from urban development by to the Rent Control Act which prohibited landlords from arbitrarily raising rentals as a measure to provide affordable housing to the low-income population. Its eventual repeal in 2001 visibly changed the landscape of Penang's demographic pattern and economic activity: it led to overnight appreciation of house and real estate prices, forcing out tenants of multiple generations <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> to the city outskirts {{and the development of}} new townships and hitherto sparsely populated areas of Penang; the demolition of many pre-war houses and the mushrooming of high-rise residences and office buildings; and the emptying out and dilapidation of many areas in the city centre. Unperturbed development sparked concerns of the continued existence of heritage buildings and Penang's collection of pre-War houses (Southeast Asia's largest), leading to more vigorous conservation efforts.|$|E
25|$|Many factors {{played a}} role in Britain’s {{long-term}} economic growth, such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age. Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of {{children under the age of}} ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning to save for their own future families.|$|E
25|$|A 1950 {{study by}} the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city {{suffered}} from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets). Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding. Demolition faced almost all structures in Southwest Washington and was to have begun in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s. Most of the dwellings in Southwest D.C. were Victorian row houses. Poor and middle-class African American and immigrant Central and Eastern European families living in the area were forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> by use of eminent domain, receiving {{only a fraction of}} the value of their homes in compensation. In 1954, Southwest D.C. had about 3,900 buildings housing 4,500 families. About 60 percent of the residents were African American, and the remainder Caucasian. Only 20 percent of the residents owned their own home, and 72 percent of the buildings were rated as substandard. The area which became L'Enfant Plaza was primarily Victorian townhouses, although a shuttered slaughterhouse also stood in the area.|$|E

500|$|According to the biographer Esther Forbes, the Guy Fawkes Day {{celebration in}} the pre-revolutionary American colonies {{was a very}} popular holiday.

500|$|However, this {{served only}} as a pretext as civilians were {{subjected}} to grueling interrogations and many were taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and beaten.

Additionally, {{if there was no}} response by the villagers to the ultimatum issued by the troops, an artillery barrage was launched above and over the village itself to further intimidate the civilians.|$|E
