5000|$|Shaker Pines - This {{neighborhood}} consists {{mostly of}} quaint lakeside houses with tall pine trees towering <b>overhead.</b> <b>Shaker</b> Pines was originally {{part of the}} Shaker settlement in Enfield. The lake was built by the Shakers to power a mill. The mill stood vacant by the dam {{at the end of}} the lake, until it was dismantled in the 1980s. This mill provided shelter for Frederick Merrill in 1987 after he escaped from the local high security prison. He was dubbed [...] "The Peanut Butter Bandit" [...] after his mother sneaked him supplies for his first prison escape in 1968 in a jar of peanut butter.|$|E
30|$|Soil WEOM was {{extracted}} {{according to}} the method of Zsolnay [30]. In brief, 2 -mm mesh-sieved soil samples were centrifuged with 0.01  M CaCl 2 {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 2 (soil: volume) using an <b>overhead</b> <b>shaker</b> for 10  min. After 10 -min centrifugation at 3000 g, the supernatant was filtered through 0.4  µm polycarbonate membrane filter. WEON was quantified by subtracting inorganic N from soluble total N. Soluble total N, NO 3 –N, and NH 4 –N were quantified using an automated continuous flow analyzer (Skalar).|$|E
30|$|Both enzymes were {{purified}} {{using two}} different methods to compare their efficiency. The first method was purification using Ni Sepharose high performance beads in a batch approach. Initially, 2  mL of the Ni Sepharose high performance stock solution (stored in 20 % ethanol) were taken and washed several times. For the first washing step, the Ni Sepharose beads were resuspended in 5  mL ddH 2 O and subsequently centrifuged for 1  min at 4  °C and 4700  rpm. Then three more washing steps {{were carried out}} with 5  mL wash- and binding buffer supplied with additives for the particular enzyme. For every purification approach, 1  mL of this prepared bead suspension was incubated with 4  mL crude cell extract for 60  min in an <b>overhead</b> <b>shaker</b> at 4  °C. Preliminary tests showed, that {{in contrast to the}} standard protocol of GE Healthcare, where two times washing and resuspending in wash-and binding buffer are recommended, three washing steps with 1  mL wash-and binding buffer are necessary to avoid non-specific binding of proteins. Furthermore, an elution gradient was applied beginning with an elution step (eluate 1) using 2  mL of a 25 % v/v elution buffer (125  mM imidazole) and 15  min incubation in an <b>overhead</b> <b>shaker</b> at 4  °C. After 1  min centrifugation at 4700  rpm and 4  °C and collection of the supernatant, a second elution step (eluate 2) like this was carried out with 100 % v/v elution buffer (500  mM imidazole). The supernatants of every washing- and elution step were collected and cooled for further investigations.|$|E

50|$|Heidolph Instruments, {{founded in}} 1938 as a {{manufacturer}} of precision drive motors and engineering, is {{a manufacturer of}} high quality laboratory equipment specializing in rotary evaporation, <b>shakers,</b> <b>overhead</b> stirrers, peristaltic pumps and magnetic hotplate stirrers. The organization is headquartered in Schwabach, a city within close proximity to Nuremberg, Germany. It is there that the development and production of equipment; {{as well as the}} coordination of sales, and customer support activities are located.|$|R
30|$|The adenylate energy charge (AEC) value {{mirrors the}} {{cellular}} energy status (Atkinson and Walton [1967]) {{and can be}} assessed as follows: Biocatalytic reactions inside the cells were stopped with 35 % (w/v) HClO 4. 4  mL biosuspension was taken directly into 1  mL of precooled (− 20 °C) HClO 4 solution on ice and mixed immediately (Theobald et al. [1997]). The sample was shaken at 4 °C for 15  min in an <b>overhead</b> rotation <b>shaker.</b> Afterwards, the solution was neutralized on ice by fast addition of 1  mL 1  M K 2 HPO 4 and 0.9  mL 5  M KOH (Buchholz et al. [2001]). The neutral solution was centrifuged at 4 °C and 4, 000 ×g for 10  min to remove cell debris, precipitated protein and potassium perchlorate. The supernatant was kept at − 20 °C for batch high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements. At each sampling time, the biosuspension sample and a filtrated sample without cells was treated {{according to the above}} described procedure.|$|R
30|$|The {{determination}} of distribution coefficient (log D 7.4) {{was carried out}} by the shake-flask method in analogy to a published procedure (Fischer et al. 2012). Briefly, 800  kBq 18 F- 2  was added to a mixture of PBS (0.5  mL, pH[*]=[*] 7.4) and 1 –octanol (0.5  mL) at room temperature. The mixture was equilibrated for 15  min in an <b>overhead</b> <b>shaker</b> and further centrifuged (3  min, 5000  rpm). Aliquots (50  μL) of both phases were analyzed in a γ–counter (1480 Wizard, PerkinElmer). The partition coefficient was expressed as the ratio between the radioactivity concentrations (cpm/mL) of the 1 –octanol and the PBS phase. Values represent the mean[*]±[*]standard deviation of five determinations from one experiment.|$|E
30|$|Cfree {{of seven}} PCBs (PCB 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) and 12 PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[cd- 1, 2, 3]pyrene, dibenzo[a]anthracene and benzo[ghi]perylene) were {{determined}} in pore water of sediment and SPM samples. Equilibrium sampling of HOCs in sediment and SPM was performed as described previously [2, 6] with minor modifications. Briefly, 7 – 10  g of thawed and homogenised sediments or SPM was filled in 12 -mL round-bottom glass vials with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) septum caps. Three 10 -cm SPME fibres (Fiberguide Industries Inc.) with a 10 -µm PDMS coating {{were placed in}} each vial. All vials were agitated on an <b>overhead</b> <b>shaker</b> in darkness at 20  °C for 14  days. SPME fibres were removed and immediately cleaned with Milli-Q water, dried with lint-free tissue and stored at −[*] 20  °C in pre-cleaned aluminium foil. The HOCs in the fibres were analysed using thermal desorption in a GC–MS system. After the measurement, analyte concentrations in PDMS (CPDMS) were calculated {{based on the measured}} length and the specific volume of the fibre (0.0877  µL cm− 1). Cfree was then calculated with Eq.  2 using PDMS to water partitioning coefficients (KPDMS:water) obtained from Witt et al. [8].|$|E
