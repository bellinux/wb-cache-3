50|$|For example, {{an online}} {{computer}} game (which {{acts as a}} client) requires communication with a game server for exchanging gameplay data such as the movement of players, their different associated parameters, etc. In {{order to make it}} possible for a game server to provide such gameplay data updates to its <b>online</b> <b>clients,</b> those clients must be made accessible to the server. Usually, clients initiate connections to the game server, creating that way implicit mappings, which provide servers with the required communication channels. However, such connections can become idle and subsequently closed by the network gateways, leading to the necessity of maintaining them by using a form of keepalive messages.|$|R
