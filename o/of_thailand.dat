On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Thailand.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene <b>of</b> <b>Thailand,</b> based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene <b>of</b> <b>Thailand,</b> known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Gay, {{also known}} as the Kavali Cyclone of 1989, was a small but {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused more than 800fatalities in and around the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> in November 1989. The worst typhoon to affect the Malay Peninsula in 35years, Gay originated from a monsoon trough over the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> in early-November. Owing to favorable atmospheric conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining winds of more than 120km/h (75mph) by 3 November. Later that day, Gay became the first typhoon since 1891 to make landfall in Thailand, striking Chumphon Province with winds of 185km/h (115mph). The small storm emerged into the Bay of Bengal and gradually reorganized over the following days as it approached southeastern India. On 8 November, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category5–equivalent cyclone with winds of 260km/h (160mph). The typhoon then moved ashore near Kavali, Andhra Pradesh. Rapid weakening ensued inland, and Gay dissipated over Maharashtra early on 10 November.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic Malays {{which make}} up the {{majority}} population of Malaysia at 50.4%, are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, including the southernmost parts <b>of</b> <b>Thailand,</b> {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan to South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line.

This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
