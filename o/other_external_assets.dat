The analysis is also focused on various trends in the indebtedness of regional economies. Using the correlation matrices for selected base years, the degree of capital mobility across regions and states is quantified.

Cross-sectional evidence for 84 developing countries shows that over the last three decades countries that have had on average higher volatility of output growth (1) accumulated higher <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> in the long-run and (2) experienced more procyclical capital outflows over the business cycle than those countries with a same growth rate but a more stable output path. To explain this finding we provide a theoretical mechanism within a stochastic real business cycle growth model in which higher uncertainty of the income stream increases the precautionary savings motive of households. They have a desire to save more when the variance of their expected income stream is higher. We show that in the model the combination of income risk and a precautionary savings motive will lead to procyclical capital outflows at business cycle frequency and a higher long-run <b>external</b> <b>asset</b> position...|$|R

40|$|Recent global {{imbalances}} {{and large}} gross external financial movements have raised interest in modeling {{the relationship between}} international financial market structure and capital flows. This paper constructs a model in which the composition of national portfolios is an essential element in facilitating international capital flows. Each country chooses an optimal portfolio in face of real and nominal risk. Current account deficits are financed by net capital flows which reflect differential movements in the holdings of gross <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. A country experiencing a current account deficit will be accumulating both gross external liabilities and gross <b>external</b> <b>assets.</b> Net capital flows generate movements in risk premiums such {{that the rate of}} return on a debtor country's gross liabilities is lower than the return on its gross assets. This ensures stability of the world wealth distribution. An attractive feature of the model is that portfolio shares, returns, and the wealth distribution can be characterized analytically. A calibrated version of the model can match quite well the observed measures of gross and net <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities for the US economy. current account; international capital flows; portfolio...|$|R

5000|$|The {{difference}} between a country's <b>external</b> financial <b>assets</b> and liabilities is its {{net international investment position}} (NIIP). A country's external debt includes both its government debt and private debt, and similarly its public and privately held (by its legal residents) <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> are also taken into account when calculating its NIIP. [...] Note that commodities, as well as currencies tend to follow cyclical patterns, whereby they undergo significant valuation changes, of which is reflected in NIIP. [...] A country's international investment position (IIP) is a financial statement setting out the value and composition of that country's <b>external</b> financial <b>assets</b> and liabilities. A positive NIIP value indicates a nation is a creditor nation, while a negative value indicates it is a debtor nation.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is based on}} two papers: “A Global Perspective on External Positions” and “The External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970 – 2004 ”. The former paper highlights the increased dispersion in net external positions in recent years, particularly among industrial countries. It provides a simple accounting framework that disentangles the factors driving the accumulation of <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities (such as trade imbalances, investment income flows, and capital gains) for major external creditors and debtors. It also examines the factors driving the foreign asset portfolio of international investors, with a special focus on the weight of U.

In the latter paper, we construct estimates of <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities for 145 countries spanning the period 1970 - 2004. We describe our estimation methods and present key features of the data, at the country and the global level. We focus in particular on trends in net and gross external positions, and on the composition of international portfolios, distinguishing between foreign direct investment, portfolio equity investment, official reserves, and external debt. We document the increasing importance of equity financing and the improvement in the external position for emerging markets, and the differing pace of financial integration between advanced and developing economies.

40|$|International audienceAn {{updated version}} of Krugman's 1993 MMF {{framework}} is used to consider the implications of buoyant domestic demand for the real exchange rate and debt dynamics. The updating includes a Taylor rule for monetary policy and explicit treatment of <b>external</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. In response to an exogenous rise in the aggregate demand, short-run appreciation of the real exchange rate {{is followed by a}} prolonged decline as external debt accumulates and net wealth deteriorates. Whether in equilibrium the real exchange rate is stronger or weaker depends crucially on a comparison of real interest rates and the growth rate. If the domestic growth rate is higher than global real interest rates, the currency may strengthen in the long run despite the deterioration of net <b>external</b> <b>assets.</b> To see whether the strength of sterling is sustainable, the analysis is briefly calibrated to UK data over the last decade.
