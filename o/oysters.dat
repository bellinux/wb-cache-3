5|$|Publications {{from the}} 1990s onwards discuss angels on horseback as an indulgence or a {{delicacy}} with frequency. 1001 Foods to Die For noted {{it as an}} indulgence in North American due to the elevation of <b>oysters</b> to a delicacy status. The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink noted that the luxury of <b>oysters</b> results in cocktail sausages replacing the <b>oysters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true <b>oysters,</b> the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny <b>oysters</b> and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In <b>oysters</b> the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. <b>Oysters</b> sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially <b>oysters,</b> is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. <b>Oysters</b> collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. <b>Oysters</b> are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. <b>Oysters</b> are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, <b>oysters</b> are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. <b>Oysters</b> are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. <b>Oysters</b> were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the classic}} recipe, shucked <b>oysters</b> are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side.

5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. <b>Oysters</b> and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|As {{a fishing}} port, Calais has several notable fishing markets {{including}} Les Délices de la Mer and Huîtrière Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, {{the latter of}} which is noted for its <b>oysters,</b> lobster and crabs from Brittany.

5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. <b>Oysters,</b> scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of <b>oysters</b> and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E
25|$|Then in 1970 another <b>oyster</b> started {{outgrowing}} {{the native}} rock <b>oyster.</b> This newcomer was the Pacific <b>oyster,</b> which {{had probably been}} introduced into New Zealand waters in the 1950s from a Japanese vessel hull or in their ballast water. At first, farmers tried to remove it from their collecting sticks, but year by year Pacific <b>oyster</b> spat increased, out-competing the native rock <b>oyster.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. <b>Oysters</b> were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl <b>oysters</b> (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E

5|$|In the English Civil War, the Parliamentary Army built a {{blockhouse}} at East Mersea in 1648, {{with the}} aim of blockading the River Colne during the Siege of Colchester. Some ruins of this blockhouse remain and are known as the Block House Stone, which is legally protected by English Heritage as a scheduled monument. Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time, with numerous fish weirs being installed. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island. Some locals supplemented their income from the oyster trade by smuggling, which remained popular until the mid-19th century. Smugglers favoured the Peldon Rose, immediately north of the Strood, where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn. In the early 19th century, the increased demand for <b>oysters</b> despite a limited supply from the Strood and Pyefleet Channel led traders to get <b>oysters</b> from other places and pass them off as native to the island.|$|E
5|$|Major {{tracts of}} the Allen Ranch were {{liquidated}} opening up new development around Pasadena and other bayside communities.

40|$|<b>Oyster</b> {{mushroom}} {{is considered}} to have hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic activities. Therefore, it is classified as functional food. Prior to serving and consumption, <b>oyster</b> mushroom can be processed in various ways. This research studied the effect of three kinds of processing commonly used in cooking <b>oyster</b> mushroom; boiling, frying, and roasting. Thirty Sprague-Dawley male rats, 8 weeks old, were acclimated to laboratory condition, and then induced with high lipid diet. The rats were divided into five experiment groups; high-lipid diet (K), high-lipid diet + raw <b>oyster</b> mushroom (M), high-lipid diet + fried <b>oyster</b> mushroom (G), high-lipid diet + roasted <b>oyster</b> mushroom (P), and high-lipid diet + boiled <b>oyster</b> mushroom (R). Blood samples were obtained from orbital plexus after acclimation, hypercholesterolemic induction, and 21 days of feeding. The blood serum was examined for total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), dan high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). The result showed that cooked <b>oyster</b> mushroom had better hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic activity than raw <b>oyster</b> mushroom. Among the three, the roasted <b>oyster</b> mushroom reduced the total cholesterol the most, while boiled <b>oyster</b> mushroom reduced triglyceride the most. </p...|$|R
