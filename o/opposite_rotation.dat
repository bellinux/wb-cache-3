This pattern was similar in all normal left ventricles, hence it was assumed as the normal pattern in the horizontal motion.

40|$|Abstract Adaptation to visuomotor {{rotation}} is {{a particular}} form of motor learning distinct from force-field adaptation, sequence learning, and skill learn-ing. Nevertheless, study of adaptation to visuomotor rotation has yielded a number of findings and principles that are likely of general importance to procedural learning and memory. First, rotation learning is implicit and appears to proceed through reduction in a visual prediction error generated by a forward model, such implicit adaptation occurs {{even when it is}} in conflict with an explicit task goal. Second, rotation learning is subject to different forms of interference: retrograde, anterograde through aftereffects, and contextual blocking of retrieval. Third, <b>opposite</b> <b>rotations</b> can be recalled within a short time interval without interference if implicit contextual cues (effector change) rather than explicit cues (color change) are used. Fourth, rotation learning consolidates both over time and with increased initial training (saturation learning) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary The double-saloon-door {{seafloor}} spreading {{model was}} developed in the Western Mediterranean. During subduction rollback, opposite rotational torques are driven by the pull of a sinking slab with a curved hingeline. This propels simultaneous <b>opposite</b> <b>rotations</b> of terranes in a backarc environment. The process also occurred in the Pannonian, Aegean, Caribbean and Japan Sea basins. Unlike previous models, this novel theory, when applied to Gondwana breakup, explains arc-orthogonal rifting and seafloor spreading, clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of the Falkland Islands Block and the Ellsworth Whitmore Terrane, the separation of these terranes in a northwest southeast direction, and their eventual accretion to South America and East Antarctica respectively. As in other cases, the Gondwana terranes comprise parts of a pre-existing retroarc fold / thrust belt (the Permo-Triassic Gondwanide Orogeny). Extension and microplate rotations in the backarc are accommodated by rollback and simultaneous crustal shortening at the adjacent subduction zone / accretionary wedge...|$|R

50|$|Physically, in a {{three phase}} winding a {{positive}} sequence set of currents produces a normal rotating field, a negative sequence set produces a field with the <b>opposite</b> <b>rotation,</b> and the zero sequence set produces {{a field that}} oscillates but does not rotate between phase windings. Since these effects can be detected physically with sequence filters, the mathematical tool {{became the basis for}} the design of protective relays, which used negative-sequence voltages and currents as a reliable indicator of fault conditions.

40|$|When {{participants}} {{adapt to}} equal and <b>opposite</b> visuomotor <b>rotations</b> in close temporal proximity, {{memory of the}} 1 st is not consolidated. The authors investigated whether this retrograde interference depends {{on the use of}} equal and <b>opposite</b> <b>rotations.</b> On Day 1, different groups of participants adapted to a 30 ° ro ation followed 5 min later by rotations of + 30 °, + 60 °, or 60 °. On Day 2, all groups were retested on the 30 ° rotation. Either retrograde interference (in groups who adapted to <b>rotations</b> of <b>opposite</b> sign on Day 1) or retrograde facilitation (in the remaining group) was observed. In all groups, learning of the 2 nd rotation resulted in unlearning of the first, indicating that all visuomotor rotations compete for common working memory resources. Motor learning and control involve mastering new sensorimotor transformations relating motor output to sensory input. For example, to control a computer mouse, people must learn the kinematic transformation between motion of the mouse over a horizontal pad and motion of the cursor on a vertical monitor. People must also learn the dynamic transformation relating forces applied to the mouse and the resulting movement of the mouse. Thus, for example, people must learn to adapt our force output to the weight of the mouse and the friction between the mouse and mouse pad. Some researchers believe that the ability to learn sensorimotor transformations depends o...|$|R

50|$|Contra-rotating, also {{referred}} to as coaxial contra-rotating, is a technique whereby parts of a mechanism rotate in opposite directions about a common axis, usually to minimise the effect of torque. Examples include some aircraft propellers, resulting in the maximum power of a single piston or turboprop engine to drive two propellers in <b>opposite</b> <b>rotation.</b> Contra-rotating propellers are also common in some marine transmission systems, in particular for large speed boats with planing hulls. Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via planetary gear transmission. The configuration can also be used in helicopter designs termed coaxial rotors, where similar issues and principles of torque apply.|$|E
50|$|Adverse yaw is {{the natural}} and {{undesirable}} tendency for an aircraft to yaw {{in the opposite direction}} of a roll. It is caused by the difference in profile drag between the upward and downward deflected ailerons, the difference in lift and thus induced drag between left and right wings, as well as an <b>opposite</b> <b>rotation</b> of each wing's lift vector about the pitch axis due to the rolling trajectory of the aircraft. The effect can be greatly minimized with ailerons deliberately designed to create drag when deflected upward and/or mechanisms which automatically apply some amount of coordinated rudder. As the major causes of adverse yaw vary with lift, any fixed-ratio mechanism will fail to fully solve the problem across all flight conditions and thus any manually operated aircraft will require some amount of rudder input from the pilot in order to maintain coordinated flight.|$|E
