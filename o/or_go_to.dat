25|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic blood disorder {{which leads to}} alterations {{in the shape of}} red blood cells. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as forgetting to do homework even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they can forget about when to take medication <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a doctor appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood.|$|E

A {{greater proportion of}} people with mental disorders become homeless <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison. Families can often {{play a crucial role}} in the care of those who would typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority of those who would be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.|$|E

Chester later dumps and then fires Claire to support Jessica during the trial, which sends Claire into a screaming rage in the restaurant, trashing their meal in the process. She made good on her threat to call the Securities and Exchange Commission and blows the whistle on Chester.|$|E

25|$|Virtual Virginia (VVa) is the Department of Education's {{system for}} {{providing}} online courses to students. These classes are mostly Advanced Placement classes {{for students who}} are home schooled <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a public high school (some courses are offered to middle school students) where the course is not taught. These courses are offered free of charge to students enrolled through a high school, but not to those in private or home schooling, or those who are out of state. This program got its start in the 1980s, when AP courses were offered through satellite schools to students in Virginia, mostly to those in rural areas without many other education options. The program became known as the Virginia Satellite Education Network (VSEN). That program got combined with Virtual Virginia Advanced Placement School to become what it is today.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1978, the Inland Revenue {{informed}} Marriott that {{he still}} owed £100,000 in back tax from his Humble Pie days; he thought manager Dee Anthony had made all the necessary payments. O'Leary, Marriott's manager, advised him to leave Britain <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> prison. He sold the house in Golders Green and moved to California. Marriott, Pam and son Toby were staying with friends in Santa Cruz and Marriott formed a new band called The Firm, with Jim Leverton and (most notably) former Mountain guitarist Leslie West. But after Leverton {{had to leave the}} US due to visa problems, and disputes over potential royalties, the band broke up. Marriott was by now completely broke and forced to collect empty glass bottles to redeem them for small change. According to Leslie West, Steve needed the money and accepted a lucrative offer to reform Humble Pie.|$|E
25|$|One may {{reasonably}} {{maintain an}} average and acceptable temperature for the snake {{by the use}} of a heating element or infrared light bulbs. A gradient must be offered within the enclosure to allow the snake to bask in the heat <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> cooler areas in the tank. Optimum humidity can be difficult to maintain and research must be done on the snake to determine the correct level. More than 80% humidity must be maintained for caging an anaconda species from the tropical region, while a slightly less than 30% humidity must be maintained for a species of a desert region. Photoperiods are often used with most species of snake; natural light is best for this, but low UV percentage bulbs can also be used. Captive anacondas have a reputation for unpredictability and aggression due to the temperaments of wild-caught specimens first collected for captive breeding, but with proper care, green anacondas can and do make for calm, relatively sedate pets. Due to their immense size and power however, proper respect and caution should always be maintained, and they are best left to experienced adult owners who can provide them with the proper requirements.|$|E

25|$|International child {{abduction}} occurs when one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s considered a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E

500|$|Section 68 of the Constitution {{sets out}} the ADF's command arrangements. The Section states that [...] "the command {{in chief of}} the naval and {{military}} forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative". In practice, the Governor-General does not play an active part in the ADF's command structure, and the elected government controls the ADF. The Minister for Defence and several subordinate ministers exercise this control. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though the National Security Committee of Cabinet considers important matters. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of executive government. The Commonwealth Government has never been required by the Constitution or legislation to seek parliamentary approval for decisions to deploy military forces overseas <b>or</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war.|$|E
