5000|$|The first respondent, Sweet, had on August 3, 1990, made {{an offer}} to {{purchase}} certain property from its owner. The offer was accepted on August 10. It was a condition of the offer that it [...] "includes all existing tenancies." [...] The second respondent was a tenant, having been in occupation {{in terms of an}} <b>oral</b> <b>lease</b> since 1988. On August15, 1990, the second respondent signed a written lease with the first respondent in respect of the premises. This lease, however, was subject to a suspensive condition, clause 15(i): The lease was [...] "to be confirmed by the lessor within 14 days after registration in the lessor's name." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{periodic}} tenancy, {{also known}} as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week, is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An <b>oral</b> <b>lease</b> for a tenancy of years that violates the Statute of Frauds (by committing to a lease of more than — depending on the jurisdiction — one year without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the [...] "default" [...] tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is a month-to-month tenancy.|$|E
5000|$|A {{tenancy at will}} is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no formal lease, the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a tenancy at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an <b>oral</b> <b>lease</b> for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|E

Argues that the requirements that the lease take effect in possession and that it be at the best rent reasonably obtainable should be repealed, using example scenarios to illustrate some of the points made.

50|$|Under common law, the Statute of Frauds {{also applies}} to {{contract}} modifications: for example, suppose party A makes an <b>oral</b> agreement to <b>lease</b> a car from party B for 9 months. Immediately after taking possession, party A decides that he really likes the car and makes an oral offer to party B to extend the term of the lease by 6 months. Although neither agreement alone comes under the Statute of Frauds, the extension modifies the original contract {{to make it a}} 15-month lease, thereby bringing it under the Statute. In theory, it works in reverse as well, an agreement to reduce the lease from 15 months to 9 months would not require a writing. However, almost all jurisdictions have enacted statutes that require a writing in such situations. The UCC abrogated that requirement for modification of contracts, as discussed below.|$|R

40|$|The low-income tenant is in {{a uniquely}} {{precarious}} position under the law. He typically holds under an <b>oral</b> <b>lease,</b> often on an implied periodic tenancy from week to week. Even where a written lease is executed, {{it is almost}} invariably on a form prepared by the landlord. The tenant has little bargaining power in today 2 ̆ 7 s urban housing markets; moreover, he is usually not represented by counsel and is unable to intelligently exert whatever bargaining power he may possess.
