40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a cost-effectiveness study concerning the effects of an <b>overtaking</b> prohibition on two lane rural roads. <b>Overtaking</b> prohibitions are being implemented in the Netherlands aiming to improve safety. <b>Overtaking</b> frequency on road sections with and without <b>overtaking</b> prohibition are measured by means of camera observations <b>Overtaking</b> frequencies were determined by comparing the order of vehicles at the start and end of a road segment without junctions. <b>Overtaking</b> actions were assessed by means of changes in the order of the vehicles. This was done for road segments without <b>overtaking</b> prohibition and similar road segments with <b>overtaking</b> prohibition. It turns out that up to ten percent of drivers performs <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres on normal road sections. On sections with prohibition, about one percent of drivers disobey this traffic rule. Additionally, a questionnaire was sent to drivers of one of the observed roads, with questions about the <b>overtaking</b> prohibition. 28 percent {{of the respondents indicated that}} they will not always comply with an overidable <b>overtaking</b> prohibition.

The number of <b>overtaking</b> maneuvers performed in the base scenario (without assistance) did not vary significantly from that in the assistant scenario. Male participants, however, did <b>overtake</b> significantly more than female participants. The reported activation level of all participants had grown significantly after the run with the <b>overtaking</b> assistant, compared with a similar run without assistance. Participants' ratings for the usefulness of the assistant and On how satisfying it was were both low; some participants thought the assistant was too careful (shows a red sign while it is safe to <b>overtake),</b> and others thought it was not careful enough (shows a green sign while it is not safe to <b>overtake).</b> The <b>overtaking</b> frequency of participants was not significantly related to sensation-seeking scores, which are highly related to risky driving.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the UK Department of Transport's Highway Link Design (HLD) guidelines for single carriageway roads was to develop layouts, making it clear to drivers where <b>overtaking</b> is possible and where it is undesirable. This paper presents recent <b>overtaking</b> data, and reassesses the <b>overtaking</b> sight distances specified in HLD. Data were collected on a 1175 m <b>overtaking</b> section, forming part of a 7. 3 m wide standard single carriageway with a design speed of 80 kph; the section was almost straight and level. For each <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre, many parameters of <b>overtaking</b> behaviour were measured from video recordings; the 30 hours of recorded data provided 1143 <b>overtaking</b> manouevres of different types. It was found that the HLD values for full <b>overtaking</b> sight distance (FOSD) and abort <b>overtaking</b> sight distance (ASD), for design speeds ranging from 80 kph to 120 kph, were less than the values calculated by applying the observed data to models previously developed by the authors. These methods were substantially different from those used for deriving and calculating the HLD values. The authors consider that the HLD values' apparent underestimates may lead to increased accident risk on <b>overtaking</b> sections, and reduce the efficiency of single carriageway roads, because their <b>overtaking</b> sections provide too few <b>overtaking</b> opportunities.

40|$|This driving {{simulator}} study investigated how mandatory and voluntary ISA might affect a driver's <b>overtaking</b> decisions on rural roads, by presenting drivers {{with a variety}} of <b>overtaking</b> scenarios designed to evaluate both the frequency and safety of the manoeuvres. In half the <b>overtaking</b> scenarios, ISA was active and in the remainder ISA was switched off. A rural road was modelled with a number of 2 + 1 road sections, thus allowing drivers a protected <b>overtaking</b> opportunity. The results indicate that drivers became less inclined to initiate an <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre when the mandatory ISA was active and this was particularly so when the <b>overtaking</b> opportunity was short. In addition to this, when ISA was activated drivers {{were more likely to have}} to abandon an <b>overtaking,</b> presumably due to running out of road. They also spent more time in the critical hatched area - a potentially unsafe behaviour. The quality of the <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre was also affected when mandatory ISA was active, with drivers pulling out and cutting back in more sharply. In contrast, when driving with a voluntary ISA, <b>overtaking</b> behaviour remained mostly unchanged: drivers disengaged the function in approximately 70 % of <b>overtaking</b> scenarios. The results of this study suggest that mandatory ISA could affect the safety of <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres unless coupled with an adaptation period or other driver support functions that support safe <b>overtaking...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen an {{automobile}} driver <b>overtakes</b> a lead vehicle while avoiding oncoming traffic, does {{he or she}} do so {{with reference to the}} limits of his or her car? We investigated <b>overtaking</b> {{from the perspective of the}} theory of affordances. We define the overtake-ability affordance as a ratio of the minimum satisfying velocity required for safe <b>overtaking</b> (MSV) to the maximum velocity of the driver's car (V-max). Two groups of participants performed <b>overtaking</b> maneuvers, if deemed possible, by driving either a slow (V-max= 25 m/s) or a fast (V-max= 32. 5 m/s) virtual car in <b>overtaking</b> situations constrained by 14 values of MSV. For any given MSV condition, participants in the fast car group were more likely to attempt an <b>overtaking</b> maneuver. However, when MSV was expressed in intrinsic units as a ratio of V-max for both groups, the frequency of <b>overtaking</b> was not significantly different across groups. Furthermore, <b>overtaking</b> frequency dropped to near 0 % for both groups when MSV exceeded V-max. In accordance with the affordance-based framework (Fajen, 2007), our results suggest that participants select their <b>overtaking</b> maneuvers by perceiving an overtake-ability affordance...|$|R

It is known through the graph analysis that: (1) when the traffic is sparse, most drivers tend to do free driving with less <b>overtaking,</b> and the traffic rules have no obvious facilitation function on traffic smooth; (2) with the increase of the car flow, the lane becomes narrower, and the <b>overtaking</b> rate decreases continually until it becomes zero. In the process of changing, when the <b>overtaking</b> rate is 4 % 14 % ï¼Œ, <b>overtaking</b> stimulates the traffic flow; when the <b>overtaking</b> rate is 0 4 % ï¼Œ, <b>overtaking</b> has a decreasing facilitation effect on traffic flow until it becomes zero.

When to initiate <b>overtaking</b> and how to complete <b>overtaking</b> are critical issues for an <b>overtaking</b> intelligent vehicle. We propose an <b>overtaking</b> control method based on the estimation of the conflict probability. This method uses the conflict probability as the safety indicator and completes <b>overtaking</b> by tracking a safe conflict probability. The conflict probability is estimated by the future relative position of intelligent vehicles, and the future relative position is estimated by using the dynamics models of the intelligent vehicles. The proposed method uses model predictive control to track a desired safe conflict probability and synthesizes decision making {{and control of the}} <b>overtaking</b> maneuver. The effectiveness of this method has been validated in different experimental configurations, and the effects of some parameters in this control method have also been investigated.

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, due {{to rework}} and re-entrant flow, <b>overtaking</b> of wafers can occur.

40|$|At {{the start}} of the 21 st century <b>overtaking</b> on two-lane rural roads is a major traffic safety problem. However, this {{dissertation}} research demonstrates that most drivers are perfectly able to safely perform these manoeuvres. Their time spent in the left lane is about eight seconds. Preparing subtasks of the manoeuvre, such as checking surrounding vehicles' behaviours, changing gear and starting accelerations are started in the right lane. In this way, available <b>overtaking</b> gap in the oncoming traffic stream are optimally used. This anticipative behaviour is accounted for in the proposed <b>overtaking</b> assistant design, which informs the driver about <b>overtaking</b> gaps three seconds before they become available. This system is developed to assist less daring drivers with <b>overtaking</b> and to prevent risk-taking drivers to perform <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres in unsafe situations. A driving simulator experiment demonstrated that this assistant does not much affect <b>overtaking</b> efficiency, drivers' comfort or safety, as long as the threshold for a safe gap is chosen such that the safety margin with the first oncoming vehicle remains above three seconds. A microscopic traffic simulation study shows that when this threshold is eleven seconds, traffic system efficiency remains similar or increases slightly due to increased number of <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres. Drivers' safety during <b>overtaking</b> increases, because the time-to-collision with oncoming vehicles will not become smaller than three seconds. And, drivers' comfort is improved in terms of higher <b>overtaking</b> frequencies and less time spent following. To introduce the proposed <b>overtaking</b> assistant to the market, vehicle-to-vehicle communication is necessary. This technology enables vehicles to localise all other surrounding vehicles. The automotive industry works hard on the development of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, however, it will take at least another ten years before the first <b>overtaking</b> assistant as proposed in this dissertation, will become available.

40|$|Active {{transportation}} - such as cycling - {{can provide}} health {{benefits to the}} population. However, cycling safety remains {{a major threat to}} favour the use of bicycles and, for this reason, more efforts are needed {{to reduce the number of}} crashes involving cyclists. One scenario which deserves special attention is driverâ€™s <b>overtaking</b> of cyclists since it has an increased likelihood to lead to severe injuries. The decision process for the <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre is highly influenced by driverâ€™s subjective feeling of risk and the presented driving simulator study aimed to understand how drivers <b>overtake</b> cyclists in the presence of oncoming traffic. Forty-two Japanese participants were recruited to drive on a 16 km long route and were requested to perform eight <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres of cyclists, with the oncoming vehicle at different values of nominal time to collision in each <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre. The results showed that the nominal time to collision against the oncoming vehicle had a significant effect on the <b>overtaking</b> strategy (accelerative vs. flying) and on the minimum safety margins towards the bicycle chosen by the <b>overtaking</b> driver. Besides, analysing the data by <b>overtaking</b> strategy, a decrease in minimum safety margins towards the bicycle was found for drivers who opted for a flying <b>overtaking</b> strategy: the drivers who completed the <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre without letting pass the oncoming traffic reduced their lateral distance to the bicycle when the nominal time to collision decreased. Finally, the current research showed that minimum lateral safety margins were larger in accelerative manoeuvres compared to flying manoeuvres in the most critical <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre. Overall, the research show that the comfort â€“ and, possibly, the safety â€“ of cyclists might be compromised in <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres with oncoming traffic. Also, the study provides some implications for the design of active safety systems and automated driving...|$|R
