5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component {{is more important than the}} competitive.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost.
