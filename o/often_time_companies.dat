40|$|<b>Often</b> <b>times</b> small <b>companies</b> will ignore {{very obvious}} energy saving {{opportunities}} {{even if they}} know that correcting the problem might save them few dollars. Two cases are presented here which deals with the energy saving opportunities found in typical small scale manufacturing plants. Several reasons are looked at why these recommendations get implemented and why not. Do plant owner's really care about energy savings? It seems that several factors influence their behavior (a) their understanding about their current energy needs (b) their need to save energy cost (c) utility and government subsidy (d) if the associated recommendation also saves company waste or labor cost and (e) if they have time or expertise {{to carry out the}} project...|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the decline of {{traditional}} small business financing, new sources of debt and equity financing have increased including Crowdfunding and Peer-to-peer lending. Unless small businesses have collateral and can prove revenue, banks are hesitant to lend money. <b>Often</b> <b>times</b> start up <b>companies</b> and businesses operating for less than a year do not have collateral and private money lenders or angel investors are a better option. Private money lenders and angel investors are willing to take more risk than banks recognizing the potential upside. Private lenders can also reach a decision faster with approvals only going through one tier rather than being overlooked by many levels of management.|$|R
40|$|Creating and {{maximizing the}} {{shareholder}} value, is eventually {{the goal of}} any company, and executives must therefore make key decisions regarding the focus and priorities of the company {{in order to create}} such a value. As part of this, the executives should constantly look at the company presence - sustaining and expanding the present existing products, while also gazing forward to long term investment by creating new products and new businesses. This balance, between the present and the future, the old and the new, is one of the toughest of all managerial challenges, and it 2 ̆ 7 s no surprise that few companies do it well. Almost every company needs at some time to renew itself through the creation of new or even breakthrough products and/or processes, but it shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t do so, however, at the expense of its traditional business. Nevertheless, <b>often</b> <b>times,</b> we see <b>companies</b> putting most of their focus on the present, short-term business, rather than on developing new ones. This can put the company at risk to fail in delivering on a value-creating growth strategy and may even have severe outcome and consequences...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} paper’s {{research}} is to investigate drivers working hours standardization opportunities within planning of local deliveries for cities with heavy traffic. Commodities distribution planning is a complicated process especially for big cities due to loading of roads. It is necessary to use both vehicles and staff by optimal way to minimize deliveries costs. The object of investigation is delivery processes’ <b>time.</b> <b>Often</b> <b>companies</b> use over vehicles because may not satisfy their customers with less number of vehicles. If an enterprise has additional vehicles, it needs also to hire more drivers. Consequently, company’s costs increase, but profit decreases. Drivers working hours standardization is also important because it is indispensable to delivery production to each customer timely. When customers require a small production quantity, forwarder should to combine many customers’ orders within one circular route served by the particular vehicle. Actually, using drivers working hours standardization, forwarder solves two main tasks – firstly, uses own resources by optimal way; secondly, serves clients timely. Specialists should use micro-element method to make drivers working hours standardization especially for cities with intensive traffic...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of child}} labor in {{developing}} countries, especially by U. S. companies is a hot-button issue in the modern business world. <b>Often</b> <b>times,</b> when prominent <b>companies,</b> such as Nike and Gap, are exposed for their use and/or exploitation {{of child labor}}, the backlash from the general public can have a drastic effect on the company’s bottom line. Our investigation questions whether the issue of child labor is perceived so negatively {{in the public eye}} because of its inherent nature, or because of how it is portrayed by the general media. There are seemingly countless reports of instances when U. S. companies have abused their authority as job providers in developing countries. But, it is also reasonable to believe that, when executed appropriately and humanely, the economic benefits of child labor can become a great asset to a growing country’s economy. American companies have high standards for their workers in the United States, but the very nature of a developing country makes it nearly impossible, and therefore easier, to adopt less stringent labor laws and regulations. Whether this issue centers on simply the physical conditions children often work in, the fact that children are being used as a labor source to begin with, or biased media coverage, this business practice has more aspects than many people realize. Our objective is to show that there is an ethical side of using children in the work force...|$|R
