5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other species}} of the family Cotingidae, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves {{rather than in the}} trees. The female lays one or two eggs in the nest <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> plant material, which is {{attached}} by saliva to a vertical rock. The male does not participate in the building of the nest or the incubation of the eggs. Eggs typically incubate for 27–28 days. The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements. The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices. Due to the solid nature of these nests, they typically persist from one breeding season to the next. Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> a lack of {{preparation}} {{on the part of}} Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl feeds {{primarily}} on insects, though some plant matter, such as fruit and flower buds, is eaten. One feeding strategy involves following Dorylus army ant swarms, feeding on insects flushed by the ants. Rockfowl {{move through the}} forest mainly {{through a series of}} hops and bounds, or short flights in low vegetation. It travels either alone or in small groups. This species rarely flies for long distances. The grey-necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month.|$|E

25|$|While most {{crocodilians}} {{are social}} animals sharing basking spots and food, saltwater crocodiles are more territorial {{and are less}} tolerant of their own kind; adult males will share territory with females, but drive off rival males.

25|$|Jessop's {{original}} {{designs for}} the harbour included a dam with an 'overfall', {{with the level of}} the water determined by the height of the dam's crest. As a result of the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> silt in the harbour, ships entering the narrow harbour were frequently being grounded. In 1832 Brunel was called upon to provide the solution to this problem and designed the sluice system, still in use today, to remove excesses of foul-smelling silt and mud.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860s and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 20th century, miners dumped staggering quantities <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> gravel from hydraulic mining operations into the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

This material flowed down the rivers, progressively eroding into finer and finer sediment, until it reached the bay system. Here some of it settled, eventually filling in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay, in decreasing order of severity.|$|E
25|$|Although wind speeds were extreme, {{the major}} cause of damage and loss of life {{appears to have been}} storm surge.

25|$|Artisans used a mass <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> straw fixed {{around a}} metal rod {{to form a}} core, and built up a vessel by either dipping the core in liquified glass, or by {{trailing}} liquid glass over the core. The core was removed after the glass had cooled, and handles, rims and bases were then added. These vessels are characterised by relatively thick walls, bright colours and zigzagging patterns of contrasting colours, and were limited in size to small unguent or scent containers. This early technique continued in popularity during the 1st century BC, despite the earlier introduction of slumped and cast vessels.|$|E
25|$|As {{they ate}} and ate, their {{luminous}} body {{began to be}} coated by the mud substance, formed a coarser body, then suddenly, the sun and moon were seen, so were the stars, and also Night and Day began on Earth. The logical explanation of this was that the creatures were the self-illuminating, so blinding and luminous that they didn't notice the Sun. The Earth was covered in their light. So, when the materialization took place, the light faded inside their newly conceived 'body' <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> thus the night and day became apparent to them.

25|$|In 1898, the Company for the Exploitation of the Lagoon of Guatavita {{was formed}} and {{taken over by}} Contractors Ltd. of London, in a deal {{brokered}} by British expatriate Hartley Knowles.

This made it impossible to explore, and when the mud had dried in the sun, it had set like concrete. Artifacts worth only about £500 were found, and auctioned at Sotheby's of London.

25|$|The top {{sedimentary}} {{layer is}} the Thomson Formation which was deposited 1,880 to 1,870 {{million years ago}} and deformed by the Penokean orogeny 1,850 million years ago. The formation contains folded and metamorphosed greywacke, siltstone, mudstone and slate which were originally deposited in the sea as horizontal beds <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> sand; the Penokean orogeny subjected the rocks to intense compression from the south. This folded the layers into east-west trending anticlines and synclines, and compressed the muddy beds into slate, a metamorphic rock. The Thomson Formation has steeply dipping beds of greywacke, siltstone and slate. Several basaltic dikes, from the lava of the Midcontinent Rift period, cut across the Thomson Formation slate and greywackes. Most of these dikes trend in a northeasterly direction; they represent magma that rose in fissures in the crust.|$|E
25|$|P. alternata builds dense {{clusters}} of nests in dark, damp cavities including caves and man-made {{structures such as}} vaults under bridges, water pipes, and the ceilings of grottoes. The nests of P. alternata typically appear brown with grey and pale bands due to the use <b>of</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. The composite materials of the nests include a mixture of mud, sand, and plant hairs. The nests are cylindrical in shape with a size ranging from 1.5cm in diameter and 6.5cm in length. Similar to other species in the Stenogastrinae subfamily, the nests contain a low number of cells with a maximum of 35 total. There are two known types of nests based on location. The most common type is built on flat surfaces and the other type hangs from thread-like suspensions from ceilings.|$|E
