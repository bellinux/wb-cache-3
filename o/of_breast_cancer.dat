40|$|Background Hereditary <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> runs in {{families}} where several members in different generations are affected. Most <b>of</b> these <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> {{are caused by}} mutations in the high penetrance genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 accounting for about 5 % <b>of</b> all <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> Other genes that include CHEK 2, PTEN, TP 53, ATM, STK 11 /LKB 1, CDH 1, NBS 1, RAD 50, BRIP 1 and PALB 2 have been described to be high or moderate penetrance <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility genes, all contributing to the hereditary <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> spectrum. However, in still a part <b>of</b> familial hereditary <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> no relationship to any <b>of</b> these <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility genes can be found. Research on new susceptibility genes is therefore ongoing. Design In this review we will describe {{the function of the}} today known high or moderate penetrance <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility genes and the consequences of their mutated status. Furthermore, we will focus on the histology, the immunophenotype and genotype <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> caused by mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes and the other high or moderate penetrance <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> susceptibility genes. Finally, an overview of the clinical implications <b>of</b> hereditary <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients will be provided. Conclusion This information leads {{to a better understanding of}} the morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of different types <b>of</b> hereditary <b>breast</b> <b>cancers.</b> Further, these characteristics offer clues for diagnosis and new therapeutic approaches...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E

40|$|<b>Breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{the most}} common type of cancer in women worldwide.

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women.

The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E

30|$|Currently, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{grouped into}} three subtypes that dictate therapy: ER and/or PR expressing, Her 2 expressing, or TNBC which implies {{the absence of}} these three receptors.

Treatment {{at some point during}} the course of therapy will necessarily include hormonal agents. Endocrine therapy has been shown to both prolong life and decrease treatment related morbidity. Her 2 overexpressing <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> represents approximately 15 - 20 % <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> ([Bauer et al. 2007]). Although treatment with trastuzumab has vastly improved survival in patients with Her 2 positive tumors, the prognosis for this group remains worse than for their hormone receptor expressing counterparts.

5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer.
