40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the transformation of}} pseudomorphic Ni films on Pd(100) into their bulk fcc phase {{as a function of}} the film thickness. We made use of x-ray diffraction and x-ray induced photoemission to study the evolution of the Ni film and its interface with the substrate. The growth of a film with tetragonally strained face centered symmetry (fct) has been observed by out-of-plane x-ray diffraction up to a limit thickness of 10 Ni pseudomorphic layers (some of them partially filled and intermixed with the substrate), where a new fcc bulklike phase is formed. After the formation of the bulklike Ni domains, we observed the pseudomorphic fct domains to disappear preserving the number of layers and their spacing. The phase transition thus proceeds via lateral growth of the bulklike phase within the pseudomorphic one, i. e., the bulklike fcc domains penetrate down to the substrate when formed. This large depth of the walls separating the domains of different phases is also indicated by the increase of the intermixing at the substrate-film interface, which starts at the onset of the transition and continues at even larger thickness. The bulklike fcc phase is also slightly strained; its relaxation towards the <b>orthomorphic</b> lattice structure proceeds slowly with the film thickness, being not yet completed at the maximum thickness presently studied of 30 Angstrom (similar to 17 layers) ...|$|E

The analysis of this construction is based on the use of an original mathematical tool in biology: the axes of inertia. Using the selection of both mental foramen, both infra and supra orbital foramen and the head of both malleus, the C 2000 software creates a geometrical construction called: "the maxillo-facial frame", as well as, a 3 D cephalometric analysis: angles, distances, areas, volumes center of gravity and axes of inertia. Using the selection of teeth, the C 2000 software calculates the axes of inertia of each tooth or of groups of teeth. The use of the axes of inertia allow us to create of a hierarchy of anatomical levels the teeth, the half arches, the arches, both arches and the maxillo-facial frame. In addition, for each of these anatomical levels, the axes of inertia create a 3 D landmark which allows the calculation of the orientation of each of these elements in relation to the others.

The quality of the outputs is depending on how good a reference system is defined. The existing reference system is based on Rectified Skew <b>Orthomorphic</b> Projection (RSO), which is projected from Malayan Revised Triangulation (MRT) system. Many researches have been carried out to get a global coordinate system that suite with earthâ€™s surface. A new datum also called geocentric datum, which is the origin referred to the origin of the earth, gives the best surface reference system for the entire world. In remote sensing applications, datum system (transformation) is important factor to gather spatial data for determination of coordinate location. By using the RSOgeodetic datum and RSOgeocentric datum as reference surfaces, geometry correction has been performed in terms to see the differences. The results shows that the average RMS errors is 0. 2867 meter for north KL and 0. 3306 meter for south KL from twelve checkm points that are measured. Then, the Z-test is carried out and the result shows that the errors of the checkpoints are accepted in 95 percent of confident level.

40|$|A key {{prerequisite}} for effective GIS based Infiltration Excess Overland Flow (IEOF) simulation and visualization is good knowledge of GIS core concept and prediction of soil infiltration rates due to impervious area coverage. The {{success or failure}} for a GIS based IEOF simulation and visualization resides initially with the georeference system used. Implementation of soft geo-objects representing flow elements such as streams, mudflows and runoff provides better dynamic visualization in terms of velocity and direction. Inclusion of volume would offer substantial effort towards determining volume of stormwater runoff hits the flood-plain areas, estimating channel flow capacity, routing and diversions to reduce flood disasters realistically. However, cartographers have long complained about the poor quality of the output from GIS, which generally today is not due to limitation of the GIS itself, but to {{lack of understanding of}} cartographic principles among hydrologists and environmentalists. With rapid growth of urbanization, industrialization and climate change, previous historical runoff and infiltration rate would provide improper guide for the future enhanced visualization of the current 2 D land use surface to improve future hydrologic impact assessment. This study aims to visualize the influence of georeferencing towards IEOF simulation represented by volumetric soft geo-objects dynamically within 3 D environment driven by physically based Green-Ampt method. Visualization is analyzed by focusing on infiltration and overland flow process using conformal Malaysian Rectified Skew <b>Orthomorphic</b> (MRSO) and equidistance Cassini-Soldner projections.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{visualization of}} the interocclusal relationship {{is essential in}} a three-dimensional virtual planning setup for orthognathic and facial <b>orthomorphic</b> surgery. The {{purpose of this study}} was to introduce and evaluate the use of a wax bite wafer in combination with a double computed tomography (CT) scan procedure to augment the three-dimensional virtual model of the skull with a detailed dental surface. A total of 10 orthognathic patients were scanned after a standardized multislice CT scanning protocol with dose reduction with their wax bite wafer in place. Afterward, the impressions of the upper and lower arches and the wax bite wafer were scanned for each patient separately using a high-resolution standardized multislice CT scanning protocol. Accurate fitting of the virtual impressions on the wax bite wafer was done with surface matching using iterative closest points. Consecutively, automatic rigid point-based registration of the wax bite wafer on the patient scan was performed to implement the digital virtual dental arches into the patient's skull model (Maxilim, version 2. 0; Medicim NV, St-Niklaas, Belgium). Probability error histograms showed errors of < or = 0. 16 mm (25 % percentile), < or = 0. 31 mm (50 % percentile), and < or = 0. 92 (90 % percentile) for iterative closest point surface matching. The mean registration error for automatic point-based registration was 0. 17 +/- 0. 07 mm (range, 0. 12 - 0. 22 mm). The combination of the wax bite wafer with the double CT scan procedure allowed for the setup of an accurate three-dimensional virtual augmented model of the skull with detailed dental surface.

40|$|A few {{theoretical}} models predict Fe to display both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, {{depending on the}} volume of the unit cell. A proper choice of the substrate allows the growth of thin Fe overlayers with structures different from the bcc bulk one. The Cu 3 Au(001) substrate is a suitable candidate for testing these magnetic properties since it has a lattice parameter (3. 75 Angstroms) which lies closer to the ferromagnetic fcc Fe phase (3. 66 Angstroms) than to the ferromagnetic bcc phase (4. 07 Angstroms). We have investigated Fe films up to 40 Angstroms thickness by means of Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD) and Photo/Auger [...] Electron Diffraction (ED). The combination of GIXRD and ED allows one to obtain quantitative information on the in [...] plane spacing "a" from the former technique, and the ratio between the vertical spacing "c" and "a", from the latter one. At low coverage the film grows pseudomorphic to the fcc substrate up to a limit thickness of 8 Angstroms. Above this limit the film is characterized by the coexistence of the pseudomorphic phase with another tetragonally strained phase. The latter phase is shown to fall on the epitaxial curve of tetragonally distorted fcc Fe phase. Finally, above 17 Angstroms the development of a body centered phase "alpha", whose unit cell is rotated of 45 deg. with respect to the substrate one, has been clearly observed. "alpha" is the dominating phase for film thickness higher than 25 Angstroms and its lattice constant evolves towards the <b>orthomorphic</b> phase in strict quantitative agreement with epitaxial curves calculated for the tetragonally distorted bcc iron phase.
