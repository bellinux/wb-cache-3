5|$|The Ravens {{flew the}} entire gamut of U.S. <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft,</b> from O-1 Bird Dogs, and U-17s, to T-28s and, {{eventually}} more modern O-2 Skymasters and OV-10 Broncos. Each Raven carried aloft a Laotian observer, who could provide almost immediate clearance for air strikes. On the ground, Laotian Forward Air Guides (FAGs) also called in for air support missions.|$|E
5|$|Hans Waldmann was {{credited}} with 134 aerial victories, claimed in 527 combat missions, 10 on the Western Front and 124 on the Eastern Front. His tally on the Eastern Front includes five bombers, 86 fighters and 33 Il-2 Sturmovik ground-attack aircraft. On the Western Front he claimed seven fighters, two four-engined bombers and one <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft.</b> He also flew a number of ground attack missions, destroying 33 various vehicles and eight heavy transports.|$|E
5|$|Sailing via Bombay, India, No.3 Squadron {{arrived at}} Suez, Egypt, in late August 1940. In its {{original}} army cooperation role supporting the Australian 6th Division in the North African Campaign, the squadron {{was equipped with}} obsolescent Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Westland Lysander <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft.</b> As part of his unit's work-up for operations, McLachlan organised training exercises with the 6thDivision, as well as written exams to test his men's knowledge of army jargon and air-to-ground communications.|$|E

5|$|The Great Artiste was a U.S. Army Air Forces Silverplate B-29 bomber (B-29-40-MO 44-27353, Victor number 89), {{assigned}} to the 393d Bomb Squadron, 509th Composite Group. The aircraft was named for its bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, in reference to his bombing talents. It flew 12 training and practice missions in which it bombed Japanese-held Pacific islands and dropped pumpkin bombs on targets in Japan. It was the only aircraft to participate in both the bombing of Hiroshima and the bombing of Nagasaki, albeit as an <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft</b> on each mission.|$|E
5|$|Lexington was {{designed}} to carry 78 aircraft, including 36 bombers, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces {{at the top of}} the hangar. In 1936, her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F-1 and 18 Boeing F4B-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve. Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares. Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians, plus one in reserve, and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft.</b> This amounted to 79 aircraft, plus 30 spares.|$|E

5|$|The first {{purpose-built}} {{military aircraft}} in the Swiss air force was a Fokker D.II seized after a German pilot made a forced landing in foul weather near Bettlach on 13 October 1916. In June 1917, five Nieuport 23 C.1 fighter planes were acquired from France. Swiss industry manufactured more than 100 Häfeli DH-3 <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but efforts to build a Swiss fighter (the Häfeli DH-4) were halted in 1918 because of the prototypes' poor performance. By {{the end of the}} war, the Swiss air force had only 62 pilots and 68 aircraft of nine different makes, almost all of which were suitable only for observation missions. Its wartime budget of CHF 15 million amounted to just 1.25% of Swiss military expenditures.|$|E
5|$|Waldman was {{the head}} of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. He {{developed}} microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a camera operator on the <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft.</b> He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft,</b> flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen {{fighters were}} sent to strafe from low altitude, German ground targets ahead of the British infantry, roving behind German lines, attacking infantry, transport, gun-teams and machine-gun nests; the attacks {{continued}} all day, {{with two of the}} British aircraft being shot down. Organised attacks were made on the German airfields at Bisseghem and Marcke near Courtrai and the day bombing squadrons attacked airfields at Ramegnies Chin, Coucou, Bisseghem (again) and Rumbeke. Reconnaissance reports of German troops concentrating from Quesnoy to Warneton, led to aircraft setting out to attack them within minutes. German fighters made a considerable effort to intercept corps <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft</b> over the battlefield but were frustrated by patrols on the barrage line and offensive patrols beyond; only one British corps aircraft was shot down by German aircraft during the day. After dark, the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron bombed railway stations at Warneton, Menin and Courtrai. Ignorance of the situation at the northern end of the II Anzac Corps front was resolved by air reconnaissance at dawn on 8 June.|$|E

5|$|The {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, {{one of each}} aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay {{before moving on to}} attack Bellows Army Airfield. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two Curtiss P-40 fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had earlier diverted from Hickam Army Airfield, and also destroyed a Stinson O-49 <b>observation</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the ground for the loss of one of their own. The fighters with remaining ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but {{it is not possible to}} identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two D3As from Hiryū were lost during the attack, one shot down by Second Lieutenant George Welch.|$|E
