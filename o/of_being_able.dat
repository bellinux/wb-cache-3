5|$|Kertész {{worked in}} the {{settings}} of many famous homes and notable places, as well as overseas, where he traveled again in England, Budapest and Paris, renewing friendships and making new ones. During the 1945–62 period at House and Garden, the magazine published more than 3,000 of his photographs, and he created a high reputation in the industry. With little time for his personal work, Kertész felt starved <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to exercise more artistic creativity.|$|E

Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to move through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the opening phases of the East Timor {{operation}} began in 1999, the issue regarding the purpose of the Army Reserve still had not been resolved. Instead <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to provide formed units to augment the Regular Army, the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round-out purposes only. As a result, in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET, mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing. As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000, however, a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full-time service.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E

He had originally intended to study business but became interested in acting at the age of sixteen when a friend convinced him to take Theatre Studies at A-level as they were one pupil short <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to run the class.

5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material {{gave rise to a}} number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E

The Bengal cell was to look for the Punjab Mail entering the Howrah Station the next day (which would have been cancelled if Punjab was seized) and was to strike immediately.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player {{a better view of}} the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>able</b> to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood.
