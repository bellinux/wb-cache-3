5|$|The Bronco Pep Band is a student-run band at Cal Poly Pomona. The band {{is a group}} {{within the}} {{athletic}} department. It follows the tradition of other student-run bands {{in the sense that}} it focuses on its members individuality. The band attends athletic events during the year to encourage the school's athletic teams and audience support/involvement. The pep band is entirely voluntary and all students at Cal Poly Pomona <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in the area are free to join.|$|E
5|$|In early 1898, The Montreal Gazette {{reported}} that NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire {{for the coming}} season. Chamberlain did not ultimately work for the NL because he was unhappy with the salary that he was offered. He played local semi-amateur baseball in Buffalo and then {{announced that he was}} leaving baseball to become a boxer. He challenged Jack Baty, a black fighter, to a boxing match and posted a $500 bet on the fight. There is no record of Chamberlain boxing against Baty <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else,</b> and little is known about his life after the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{for help}}, Doggett {{approaches}} FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) for {{help on the}} case. Doggett's ex-wife, Barbara Doggett, meets up for a lineup at a police station. Barbara does not recognize Regali <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> on the lineup. Scully finds some similarities between Luke and the two dead bodies, but no forensic proof. Doggett comes to realize that Regali has had help from someone within the FBI all along. Follmer informs Reyes and Doggett that Cadet Hayes is really Stuart Mimms, a former mental patient. He also informs them that Mimms lived in New York City during the year of Luke's murder, hinting that Mimms is the murderer and not Regali. Doggett and Reyes assemble a SWAT team to raid Mimms apartment. Mimms is taken into police custody and at a new lineup, Barbara recognizes Mimms.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted {{that he may have}} been able to do so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E

Moreover, the 1860 census listed Williams as age 5 in June 1860, suggesting that he was born in November 1854.|$|R

25|$|In 1778, Samuel {{painted the}} women on a {{speculative}} basis without taking sittings {{in an attempt to}} advance his career as a portrait and history painter. The resulting work was exhibited at the exhibition in 1778 where it attracted little attention.

25|$|I do feel strongly, {{after my}} {{subcommittee}} has carefully and objectively reviewed this case from both sides, that injustice rather than justice has been served.

25|$|The mass {{demonstrations and}} strikes in France in May 1968 {{severely}} challenged De Gaulle's legitimacy.

On 29 May, De Gaulle disappeared without notifying Prime Minister Pompidou <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in the government, stunning the country. He fled to Baden-Baden, Germany to meet with General Massu, then head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters. De Gaulle returned to France after being assured of the military's support, in return for which De Gaulle agreed to amnesty for the 1961 coup plotters and OAS members.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} myth, the AMC V8 was not built by Ford <b>or</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> {{although}} it bears an uncanny resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing gear case that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right lifter bank by tangentially intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam to crank and another from the crank to the right lifter bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but {{the balance of the}} engine design is unique.|$|E
