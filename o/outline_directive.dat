50|$|Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, at {{the time}} an adversary to Muhammad but a {{signatory}} to the, then recent, Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, was trading in Greater Syria when he was summoned {{to the court of}} Heraclius. Asked by Heraclius about the man claiming to be a prophet, Abu Sufyan responded, speaking favorably of Muhammad's character and lineage and <b>outlining</b> some <b>directives</b> of Islam. Heraclius was seemingly impressed by what he was told of Muhammad, and felt that Muhammad's claim to prophethood was valid. Despite this incident, it seems that Heraclius was more concerned with the current rift between the various Christian churches within his empire, and as a result did not convert to Islam.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{the importance and}} role of urban plans in spatial planning. Generally, these plans have {{the character of a}} specific regulation, establishing rules and <b>outlining</b> <b>directives</b> for the development of localities, determining the areas to be built and the areas with no constructions in a certain locality, assigning the functions in localities, thus influencing the development and organization of the territory. Any construction or any investment is {{made on the basis of}} such a plan (General Urban Plan, Zonal Urban Plan, and Detailed Urban Plan) following the legislation and the plans for that specific territory at that moment. The wider territorial plans (plans made for the national territory or at a county scale) and the present urban legislation regulate the manner of intervention on a territory through urban plans. However, the urban regulations apply differently according to the specificity of the rural area, taking into account the cultural influences, the traditions, customs, the relief forms, population, etc. (i. e. the General Urban Plan for Săvădisla – Hungarian influences in land planning, the General Urban Plan of Râşca, the General Urban Plan of Unguraş – planning influenced by the landscape). The Zonal Urban Plan and the Detailed Urban Plan are documents that have the role of modifying the regulations of the general urban plan, establishing new requirements for building regime and spatial arrangement (ex. Zonal Urban Plan of Călăţele holiday village - planning of a tourist area), taking into account the area’s specificity and the needs of the community, the territorial offer etc. The urban plans can contribute to the spatial development of a locality by setting the functions and facilities, yet they can also restrict and limit the way in which a rural locality develops...|$|R

The height of French mercantilism is closely associated with Jean-Baptiste Colbert, finance minister for 22 years in the 17th century, to the extent that French mercantilism is sometimes called Colbertism. Under Colbert, the French government became deeply involved in the economy in order to increase exports. Protectionist policies were enacted that limited imports and favored exports. Industries were organized into guilds and monopolies, and production was regulated by the state through a series of more than one thousand <b>directives</b> <b>outlining</b> how different products should be produced.|$|R

40|$|The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ('EU ETS') {{began on}} 1 January 2005. The {{implementation}} of the EU ETS has raised interest in market-based approaches to achieving environmental and related public policy goals in the EU, particularly those related to promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Indeed, national and regional markets in tradable green certificates ('TGCs') and (to a lesser extent) tradable white certificates ('TWCs') already exist. Green certificate schemes are established or proposed {{in a number of}} Member States (e. g., Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK) and form part of a growing portfolio of measures to achieve the renewable targets <b>outlined</b> in <b>Directive</b> 2001 / 77 /EC. White certificate schemes are considerably less widespread, although schemes have been established in Italy and the UK and further activity may be stimulated by the Commission proposal on energy services (COM(2003) 739). Both the renewables Directive and the energy services proposal envisage the possible evolution and harmonisation of these instruments into EU-wide certificate schemes. This study has two major objectives: - 1. Analyse interactions among EU ETS and green/white certificate markets. The first major objective is to describe the interactions between green and white certificate programmes and the EU ETS. - 2. Assess implications of interactions for the policy objectives of the EU ETS. The second major objective deals with the implications of green/white certificate programmes for the objectives of the EU ETS...|$|R

40|$|Since May 23 rd, 1942 when Mao Zedong <b>outlined</b> his <b>directives</b> {{regarding}} arts {{policy in}} his closing remarks as the ?Talks at the Yan?an Conference on Literature and Art,? there has existed a singular interconnection between Chinese art and politics. Throughout various {{political and ideological}} campaigns, artists and writers were treated as a ?cultural army? to mobilize the people and to engineer the soul. To this end, artists and writers were often constrained to specific topics and styles and subject to both censorship and self-censorship. An examination {{of the results of}} these constraints and the reaction on the part of artists as well as viewers of this work provides a window into an important aspect of socialist life: the often tense relationship between the ideological demands of the Party and the private desires of the Chinese people. The intent of this thesis is to describe both the nature of propaganda work and the system of controls under which it was created. Specifically I will describe the constantly shifting political winds, the tightening and relaxation of content and stylistic limitations, and the variegated, often ambiguous, sometimes violent ideological movements, all of which {{had a profound effect on}} artistic and literary production. This description includes all major political movements starting with the ?Yan?an Talks? in 1942, the ways in which control systems continued to affect art and literary production after Mao?s death in 1976, and how this system continues to have influence today. This thesis also attempts to make preliminary conclusions about the effectiveness of propaganda materials and their potential unintended effects. The purpose of these observations are to highlight the areas in which the study of Chinese propaganda materials is deficient and thus create a space for my future dissertation work...|$|R

As stated in the DoD policy, the SAM {{was to be the}} central source for IT services, and therefore, eliminated the requirement for each DoD component to establish, operate, and maintain duplicative technologies. The policy also directed the SAM to explicitly manage costs, as the <b>directive</b> <b>outlined</b> the responsibility to operate as a business, and continually evaluate new commercial alternatives to find cost savings. Since the inception of the SAM, several organizational changes and major events have impacted its course. The organization’s name was changed to its current name, United States Army Information Technology Agency, in 2003. In addition to the name change, ITA evolved from a field operating agency under the operational control of the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army (OAA) where it remains today.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe EU is {{pioneering}} {{the development}} of greenhouse gas emissions trading, {{but there is a}} tension between the ‘top-down' and ‘bottom-up' evolution of trading schemes. While the Commission is introducing a European emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) in 2005, several member states have already introduced negotiated agreements that include trading arrangements. Typically, these national schemes have a wider scope than the proposed EU directive and allow firms to use relative rather than absolute targets. The coexistence of ‘top-down' and ‘bottom-up' trading schemes may create some complex problems of policy interaction. This paper explores the potential interactions between the EU ETS and the negotiated agreements in France and UK and uses these to illustrate some important generic issues. The paper first describes the proposed EU <b>directive,</b> <b>outlines</b> the UK and French policies and compares their main features to the EU ETS. It then discusses how the national and European policies may interact in practice. Four issues are highlighted, namely, double regulation, double counting of emission reductions, equivalence of effort and linking trading schemes. The paper concludes with some recommendations for the future development of UK and French climate policy...|$|R
