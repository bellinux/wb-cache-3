5|$|That second column, {{commanded}} by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan's VCorps division, was escorting the French siege-train and therefore {{had to take}} a longer, more practicable route into Extremadura. Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry, a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5,000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros. When confronted by Marshal Mortier, Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat {{to the rear of the}} French column. For this reason Soult directed Gazan's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege-train, while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry. As a result, Soult finally joined Latour-Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his <b>original</b> <b>column</b> and no heavy artillery.|$|E

[...] Some of the city's residents and officials didn't want {{the memorial}} reinstalled when renovations were complete since the much larger and grander Lincoln Memorial was already under construction. [...] Others thought the tall pedestal was unsafe. [...] When the public heard of the plans to leave the monument in storage, many were upset and {{groups such as the}} Grand Army of the Republic demanded the statue be reinstalled. [...] President Warren G. Harding even lobbied Congress on behalf of angry citizens. Government officials conceded, but by that point, the statue was missing. [...] It was later found in crates behind the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and cleaned. [...] On June 21, 1922, an Act of Congress authorized the rededication, which took place April 15, 1923, 55 years after the initial dedication. [...] When the statue was replaced, it was set on a new shorter base instead of the <b>original</b> <b>column.</b> [...] An unexpected consequence of this was vandals having easy access to the statue. [...] Lincoln's fingers were broken off several times and his right hand had to be replaced.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day the column only proceeded [...] before it encountered a significant North Vietnamese roadblock. From that point onward the exodus kept moving forward only by fighting its way ahead. [...] "They hit us with everything" [...] said Ranger Private Nguyen Van Sau, describing an unrelenting shower of artillery shells, mortar rounds and rockets that flew from the jungle {{into the stream}} of refugees. Upon reaching the Đà Rằng River, only 20 kilometers from Tuy Hòa, a pontoon bridge had to be helilifted to the column. By 22 March the bridge was completed, but the advance became more hazardous due to numerous PAVN units moving into blocking positions. During the entire movement, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force provided minimal support due to bad weather. On 27 March the final roadblock was overcome and, at 21:00, the first vehicles of the column entered Tuy Hòa. [...] "How {{many people in the}} <b>original</b> <b>column</b> survived the tragic journey, no one knew exactly." [...] It was estimated by the ARVN that only 20,000 of the 60,000 troops that had started out from Pleiku finally reached the coast. Of the estimated 180,000 civilians that fled the highlands with the column, only about 60,000 got through. Those who failed to break through were either abducted or killed by PAVN forces.|$|E

30|$|The {{repaired}} columns {{were tested}} {{under the same}} initial combined loading effects as the <b>original</b> <b>columns.</b> Similar to the procedure used for testing the <b>original</b> <b>columns,</b> the testing procedure for repaired columns was initiated in force control and then continued in displacement control. In testing the <b>original</b> <b>columns,</b> testing shifted to displacement control when first yield of the reinforcing steel occurred (Prakash et al. 2012). For the repaired columns, yielding of the steel had occurred during the previous test, and monitoring the strain was not always possible due to damage to the strain gages mounted to the steel reinforcement. Therefore, testing was shifted to displacement control when significant reduction of the stiffness was observed. In addition, different procedures were used to maintain the torque-to-moment ratio (T/M) during the displacement control testing. In the original tests, an iterative feedback system was used to control the torque-to-moment ratio (Prakash et al. 2012), whereas in the present program, a trial-and-error method was used based on values recorded from the previous cycles. As a result, some differences existed in the loading protocol details.|$|R
