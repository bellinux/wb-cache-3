5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> more powerful Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|As the LSA grew, {{it began}} to take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> role outside of the {{professional}} sphere. During World War II, the LSA helped the United States government with language training programs through its Linguistic Institutes. After the longtime Secretary-Treasurer Archibald Hill retired from his position in 1969, the LSA made large changes to its organizational structure to better accommodate its new and growing role. The responsibilities of the Secretary-Treasurer were expanded and the LSA established a Secretariat in Washington, DC in order {{to act as a}} liaison between the members, federal government, and other professional organizations. In 1981, the LSA and 9 other professional organizations founded the Consortium of Social Science Associations in order to advocate for the governmental support of social science research.|$|E

5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E
5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly {{as a soldier}} in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale. Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would allow her to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope that needed munitions would arrive from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20. It was short on ammunition, had no pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River, and carried what {{would turn out to be}} inadequate provisions.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E

5|$|Lawrencium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. It is {{named in honor}} of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements. A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11hours, but the shorter-lived 260Lr (half-life 2.7minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1947, the {{inactive}} formation was redesignated as the 95th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop. It {{was then}} activated on 9 January 1948 at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On 17 December 1948, the brigade headquarters {{was moved to}} Stillwater, Oklahoma. On 30 June 1949, the troop was again reorganized as the 95th Reconnaissance Company. This allowed it to take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> structure and control more personnel. The formation was inactivated on 15 September 1951 at Stillwater, Oklahoma.|$|E

This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure from the ground floor up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence totally out of stone, {{all the way up to}} the roof. On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 1917 the Admiralty became more {{concerned}} about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict {{the actions of the}} High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS (less Renown) and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} was inactivated on 15 June 1997 in Germany.

This transformation occurred as the brigade was reassigned to the continental United States. It was activated on 24 October 1997 as the 166th Aviation Brigade at Fort Riley, Kansas. It was also activated into the Active duty force.|$|E
