40|$|Crash energy {{management}} in frontal crumple {{zone of the}} automotive body {{is one of the}} key elements for the design of automotive structure. Improving energy absorption characteristics reduces the magnitude of forces transferred to the <b>occupant</b> <b>compartments.</b> Here, a new strategy has been proposed to improve energy absorption efficiency of thin-walled columns by introducing extra stable corners in the crosssection. Several profiles of multi-corner thin-walled columns obtained through this strategy were presented and their crashworthiness capacities under axial crush loading were investigated analytically, experimentally, and numerically. First, explicit formulations for predicting the mean crushing force of multi-corner thin-walled columns were derived using the theory of super folding element (SFE). Predicted results of these formulations showed a good agreement with the results of quasi-static experiments and CAE simulations, which were performed by explicit non-linear finite element code through LS-DYNA. Based on this agreement, other significant crashworthiness assessment parameters were then investigated experimentally and numerically. Newly introduced 12 -edge section with high energy absorption capacity was developed and its dominance was established through the responses in quasi-static experiments and CAE simulations. Finally, the foundational dominance of the 12 -edge section was extended to the dynamic environment through a full vehicle crash test simulation to evaluate overall reduction in crashworthiness parameters which reflected occupant safety. Interestingly, in the case of using 12 -edge section as crush absorbers, specific energy absorption (SEA), dash intrusion and maximum occupant&# 039;s chest deceleration showed significant improvement, compared to the baseline design which used a rectangular section...|$|R

In an effort to {{increase}} road vehicles' structural strength, cellular materials, such as foam, have been utilised and installed in vital parts of the vehicle. The limited structural crush zones in side-impact collisions, when compared to frontal impacts, have shown to cause higher deformation to the passenger compartments {{that will lead to}} severe injury to the vehicle occupants. Therefore, the need to further enhance road vehicles' passive safety system to protect the occupants during side-impact collisions is necessary. In addition to many passive safety features, cellular materials have been installed in current vehicles to serve as structural reinforcement by absorbing impact energy from transferring to the occupants. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of various cellular materials in enhancing vehicle crashworthiness such as side door's intrusion, interior door's acceleration and the internal energy of the cellular materials. To fulfil the objective of this paper, an existing finite element model of a sedan vehicle is modified to include a cellular material sandwiched in between the door panels. The cellular materials used for this study are IMPAXX, polyurethane foam, micro-agglomerated cork, DAX and CONFOR foams. The mechanical properties of the cellular materials utilised in the computational model are validated. Various dynamic responses of the vehicle structure with the inclusion of the five selected materials are numerically tested and compared against the vehicle structure without the cellular materials. Side-impact simulations in accordance to federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 214 standard are used to replicate side-impact collisions. This study quantifies the energy absorption and side-door intrusion with different cellular padding. It also shows that the inclusion of cellular materials significantly reduces <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment's</b> intrusion and deceleration of the vehicle by at least 30 %.

5000|$|Observations {{from school}} bus and heavy truck rollovers also {{suggests}} that the fall and dive theories are incorrect [...] and that another theory of the mechanism of injury in rollover accidents is required, one that relates injury to the intrusion of the roof structure into the <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment</b> or more simply to [...] "roof crush". Today it is generally realized that the primary injury mechanism in light vehicle rollover accidents is not crushing. Rather, it is widely acknowledged that the principal injury process for contained,i.e., non-ejected, occupants involves the impact between the occupant and the vehicle interior. Since the severity of an impact depends {{to a large extent}} on the relative velocity between the impacting objects; the impact theory of injury causation in rollovers has sought to explain the increase in injuries associated with increased roof crush with an increase in the relative velocity between the occupant and the vehicle's interior which is generated by the roof crush. In the simplest terms, when the occupants hits a collapsing roof, they hit harder because the roof is moving in on them. If the roof was not collapsing, and thus moving towards the occupants, their velocity relative to the roof would be lower and the impact less severe.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{a report}} by the U.S. Government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, among 10 {{different}} classes of passenger vehicles, [...] "very small cars" [...] have the highest fatality rate per mile driven. For instance, a person driving 12,000 miles per year for 55 years would have a 1% chance of being involved in a fatal accident. This is twice the fatality rate of the safest vehicle class, a [...] "large car". According to the data in this report, the number of fatal crashes per mile is only weakly correlated with the vehicle weight, having a correlation coefficient of just (-0.45). A stronger correlation is seen with the vehicle size within its class; for example, [...] "large" [...] cars, pickups and SUVs, have lower fatality rates than [...] "small" [...] cars, pickups and SUVs. This is the case in 7 of the 10 classes, with the exception of mid-size vehicles, where minivans and mid-size cars are among the safest classes, while mid-size SUVs are the second most fatal after very small cars. Even though heavier vehicles sometimes are statistically safer, it is not necessarily the extra weight that causes them to be safer. The NHTSA report states: [...] "Heavier vehicles have historically done a better job cushioning their occupants in crashes. Their longer hoods and extra space in the <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment</b> provide an opportunity for a more gradual deceleration of the vehicle, and of the occupant within the vehicle...

50|$|Over time engine {{development}} has continually advanced {{in almost all}} areas from material, operation and function. Many of the advances were led by the Japanese manufacturers as they have made quality and durability the cornerstone of their programs. The Japanese advanced the proliferation of forged crankshafts with rotating assemblies at 0 gram balance. Forged crankshafts are much stronger, significantly less apt to exhibit detrimental torsional crankshaft movement which also mitigates harmonic frequencies. This progression has also seen the addition of forged rods and pistons initially in forced induction engines and more recently in normally aspirated engines. Adding these additional forged components ramps the engines rigidity reducing concern about crankshaft damage even further. With the advent of computer aided design and finite element analysis manufacturers can now find and re-engineer weaker areas. Regardless {{of some of these}} improvements certain engines like the traditional V8 which has a firing order by nature prone to excessive harmonics necessitating the use of this device. The flat plane V8, traditionally used in more exotic engines, does not suffer from the excessive harmonics and therefore may use a solid undampened device. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC Flat 4, I4, Flat 6, I6, V6, Flat 8, Flat Plane V8 have no need for this device. Over the years many of these engines use solid cast iron or aluminum crank pulley or audible NVH damper (reducing engine noise heard in the <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment).</b> Audible NVH has been the biggest factor in OE manufacturer decisions throughout the vehicle. In addition the pulleys on these engines are mounted loosely with a location fit negating any potential to act as an engine protective damper.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a vehicle’s seat back in rear impact accidents can significantly affect occupant kinematics and resulting injury potential. The only current United States (U. S.) government regulation addressing seat back strength is outlined in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 207, Seating Systems [1]. The test method outlined in this regulation is only partially predictive of seat performance in dynamic and/or real world impacts. Many seats continue to demonstrate gross deformations or catastrophic failures with potentially injurious occupant kinematics under the impact conditions of the FMVSS 301 Fuel System Integrity testing [2].

40|$|The off-set {{assessment}} procedure potentially {{contributes to the}} FIMCAR objectives to maintain the compartment strength and to assess load spreading in frontal collisions. Furthermore it provides the opportunity to assess the restraint system performance with different pulses if combined with a full-width {{assessment procedure}} in the frontal assessment approach. Originally {{it was expected that}} the PDB assessment procedure would be selected for the FIMCAR assessment approach. However, {{it was not possible to}} deliver a compatibility metric in time so that the current off-set procedure (ODB as used in UNECE R 94) with some minor modifications was proposed for the FIMCAR Assessment Approach. Nevertheless the potential to assess load spreading, which appears not to be possible with any other assessed frontal impact assessment procedure was considered to be still high. Therefore the development work for the PDB assessment procedure did not stop with the decision not to select the PDB procedure. As a result of the decisions to use the current ODB and to further develop the PDB procedure, both are covered within this deliverable. The deliverable describes the off-set test procedure that will be recommended by FIMCAR consortium, this corresponds to the ODB test as it is specified in UN-ECE Regulation 94 (R 94), i. e. EEVC deformable element with 40 % overlap at a test speed of 56 km/h. In addition to the current R 94 requirements, FIMCAR will recommend to introduce some structural requirements which will guarantee sufficiently strong <b>occupant</b> <b>compartments</b> by enforcing the stability of the forward occupant cell. With respect to the PDB assessment procedure a new metric, Digital Derivative in Y direction - DDY, was developed, described, analysed, and compared with other metrics. The DDY metric analyses the deformation gradients laterally across the PDB face. The more even the deformation, the lower the DDY values and the better the metric’s result. In order analyse the different metrics, analysis of the existing PDB test results and the results of the performed simulation studies was performed. In addition, an assessment of artificial deformation profiles with the metrics took place. This analysis shows that there are still issues with the DDY metric but it appears that it is possible to solve them with future optimisations. For example the current metric assesses only the area within 60 % of the half vehicle width. For vehicles that have the longitudinals further outboard, the metric is not effective. In addition to the metric development, practical issues of the PDB tests such as the definition of a scan procedure for the analysis of the deformation pattern including the validation of the scanning procedure by the analysis of 3 different scans at different locations of the same barrier were addressed. Furthermore the repeatability and reproducibility of the PDB was analysed. The barrier deformation readings seem to be sensitive with respect to the impact accuracy. In total, the deliverable is meant to define the FIMCAR off-set assessment procedure and to be a starting point for further development of the PDB assessment procedure...|$|R

30|$|There are {{scenarios}} {{in which}} the single staged total evacuation is not practical. In the case of staged total evacuation, some occupants {{may be asked to}} remain in the building for {{a certain period of time}} in order to optimize the flows (Pauls 1994). Those occupants might feel discomfort in remaining in a threatened environment. In addition, when high-density conditions occur in a bottleneck, the maximum flow capacity may drop (Cepolina 2009). The phased evacuation strategy is based on the concept that occupants in the most critical floors such as the fire floor and floors nearby will be prioritised. This strategy is adopted in order to decrease the queuing time in the egress components and reduce people densities in the means of escape. The fire compartmentation plays a key role in this strategy (The Building Regulation 2006). In fact, <b>occupants</b> in the <b>compartment</b> of the fire need to be evacuated, whilst the remaining occupants need to be evacuated only if it is necessary.

40|$|The {{crashworthiness}} {{enhancement of}} vehicle structures {{is a very}} challenging task during the vehicle design process due to complicated nature of vehicle design structures that need to comply with different conflicting design task requirements. Although different safety agencies have issued and modified standardized crash tests to guarantee structural integrity and occupant survivability, there is continued rise of fatalities in vehicle crashes especially the passenger cars. This dissertation research explores the applicability of a crash energy management system of providing variable energy absorbing properties {{as a function of}} the impact speed to achieve enhanced occupant safety. The study employs an optimal crash pulse to seek designs of effective energy absorption mechanisms for reducing the occupant impact severity. The study is conducted in four different phases, where the performance potentials of different concepts in add-on energy absorbing/dissipating elements are investigated in the initial phase using a simple lumped-parameter model. For this purpose, a number of performance measures related to crash safety are defined, particular those directly related to <b>occupant</b> deceleration and <b>compartment</b> intrusion. Moreover, the effects of the linear, quadratic and cubic damping properties of the add-on elements are investigated in view of structure deformation and occupant`s Head Injury Criteria (HIC). In the second phase of this study, optimal design parameters of the proposed add-on energy absorber concept are identified through solutions of single- and weighted multi-objective minimization functions using different methods, namely sequential quadratic programming (SQP), genetic algorithms (GA) and hybrid genetic algorithms. The solutions obtained suggest that conducting multiobjective optimization of conflicting functions via genetic algorithms could yield an improved design compromise over a wider range of impact speeds. The effectiveness of the optimal add-on energy absorber configurations are subsequently investigated through its integration to a full-scale vehicle model in the third phase. The elasto-plastic stress-strain and force-deflection properties of different substructures are incorporated in the full-scale vehicle model integrating the absorber concept. A scaling method is further proposed to adapt the vehicle model to sizes of current automobile models. The influences of different design parameters on the crash energy management safety performance measures are studied through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. In the final phase, the proposed add-on absorber concept is implemented in a high fidelity nonlinear finite element (FE) model of a small passenger car in the LS-DYNA platform. The simulation results of the model with add-on system, obtained at different impact speeds, are compared with those of the baseline model to illustrate the crashworthiness enhancement and energy management properties of the proposed concept. The results show that vehicle crashworthiness can be greatly enhanced using the proposed add-on crash energy management system, which can be implemented in conjunction with the crush elements. ...|$|R

40|$|Safety-shaped median {{barriers}} {{have long}} been employed to keep misguided vehicles on the roadway. In recent {{years there has been}} a growing national desire for more aesthetically pleasing roadside safety systems. Adding surface texture {{is one of the most}} popular ways to make a more aesthetically pleasing barrier. This practice of adding surface texture can potentially reduce the safety performance of the barrier. The purpose of this research was to develop guidelines for the aesthetic surface treatment of safety-shaped median barriers. Numerical simulation was utilized to develop these guidelines. This was done by first validating the vehicle model that was used in this research, which was the National Crash Analysis Center (NCAC) 2000 P Detailed Pickup Truck model. The validity of the vehicle model could be determined by comparing the vehicle dynamics of the simulation to the actual crash test data for the smooth surfaced Single Slope and New Jersey Safety-Shaped barriers. Crash tests involving concrete median barriers most commonly fail crash testing criteria given by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 by excessive <b>Occupant</b> <b>Compartment</b> Deformation (OCD). OCD is excessive deformation of the <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment</b> that would cause severe harm to the occupant. Current simulation vehicle models do not give reliable direct measurement of OCD. To take the place of direct measurement, several parameters were measured to find the best surrogate measure of OCD. The internal energy of the floorboard in the NCAC 2000 P Detailed Pickup Truck model gave the best correlation to OCD. By simulating several different past crash tests with passing and failing OCD, limits of internal energy in the floorboard could determine if a simulation had passing, marginal, or failing amounts of OCD. Using the surrogate measure of OCD a parametric study was then evaluated by NCHRP Report 350 standards. The parametric study of 29 simulations varied width and depth of recess between asperities for two different angles of asperities.

Injury risk is evaluated using the maximum injury severity for each occupant, by injury severity for each body region, and by Harm, a social cost measure. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop priorities for developing far side impact injury countermeasures which would be effective in both countries...|$|E
6000|$|Theodoric Voler {{had been}} brought up, from infancy to the {{confines}} of middle age, by a fond mother whose chief solicitude had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser realities of life. When she died she left Theodoric alone {{in a world that}} was as real as ever, and a good deal coarser than he considered it had any need to be. To a man of his temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords, and as he settled himself down in a second-class compartment one September morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental discomposure. He had been staying at a country vicarage, the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor bacchanalian, but their supervision of the domestic establishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster. The pony carriage that was {{to take him to the}} station had never been properly ordered, and when the moment for his departure drew near the handy-man who should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found. In this emergency Theodoric, to his mute but very intense disgust, found himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar’s daughter in the task of harnessing the pony, which necessitated groping about in an ill-lighted outhouse called a stable, and smelling very like one—except in patches where it smelt of mice. Without being actually afraid of mice, Theodoric classed them among the coarser incidents of life, and considered that Providence, with a little exercise of moral courage, might long ago have recognised that they were not indispensable, and have withdrawn them from circulation. As the train glided out of the station Theodoric’s nervous imagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odour of stable-yard, and possibly of displaying a mouldy straw or two on his usually well-brushed garments. Fortunately the only other <b>occupant</b> of the <b>compartment,</b> a lady of about the same age as himself, seemed inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny; the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached, in about an hour’s time, and the carriage was of the old-fashioned sort, that held no communication with a corridor, therefore no further travelling companions were likely to intrude on Theodoric’s semi-privacy. And yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady; he was not even alone in his own clothes. A warm, creeping movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resented presence, unseen but poignant, of a strayed mouse, that had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode of the pony harnessing. Furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder, whose motto, indeed, seemed to be Excelsior; and the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavoured rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual ownership. It was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a Rowton House for vagrant mice (already his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alien invasion). On the other hand, nothing less drastic than partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor, and to undress in the presence of a lady, even for so laudable a purpose, was an idea that made his eartips tingle in a blush of abject shame. He had never been able to bring himself even to the mild exposure of open-work socks in the presence of the fair sex. And yet—the lady in this case was to all appearances soundly and securely asleep; the mouse, on the other hand, seemed to be trying to crowd a Wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes. If there is any truth in the theory of transmigration, this particular mouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the Alpine Club. Sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or so; and then, in fright, or more probably temper, it bit. Theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life. Crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonised watch on his slumbering fellow-traveller, he swiftly and noiselessly secured the ends of his railway-rug to the racks on either side of the carriage, so that a substantial curtain hung athwart the compartment. In the narrow dressing-room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and half-wool. As the unravelled mouse gave a wild leap to the floor, the rug, slipping its fastening at either end, also came down with a heart-curdling flop, and almost simultaneously the awakened sleeper opened her eyes. With a movement almost quicker than the mouse’s, Theodoric pounced on the rug, and hauled its ample folds chin-high over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the further corner of the carriage. The blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead, while he waited dumbly for the communication-cord to be pulled. The lady, however, contented herself with a silent stare at her strangely muffled companion. How much had she seen, Theodoric queried to himself, and in any case what on earth must she think of his present posture? ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} complete {{results of}} the head-on small overlap crash test of vehicle with driver moving at a speed of approximately 12 m/s against stationary vehicle with post-crash rollover. When a crash does not involve the main crush-zone structures, the <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment</b> is not well protected. The emphasis in the paper was put on determination and presentation of crash parameters for the application in traffic accident analyses and for simulation {{with the help of}} software for accident reconstruction. The experimentally measured data from the crash test were analysed and important crash parameters which are necessary for accident reconstruction were obtained. The crash test was specific because of rollover of the impacting vehicle resulting from small overlap. The results have shown that small overlap accident is extremely dangerous for the crew with the possibility of vehicle rollover and occupant head and neck injury. Also in this case, at relative low speed, the driver suffered light neck and head injury in the following days and the longitudinal damage was relatively large. The input parameters for accident reconstruction software as the result of performed crash test were gained. </p...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{compatibility}} in car frontal collisions it {{is generally}} agreed that better structural interaction, matching frontal forces (stiffnesses) and a strong <b>occupant</b> <b>compartment,</b> in particular for small cars, are required. The Full Width Deformable Barrier (FWDB) test {{is part of a}} portfolio of tests being considered to assess a vehicle’s frontal impact performance, including its compatibility. For compatibility, it aims to assess a vehicle’s structural interaction potential using measurements from a high resolution Load Cell Wall behind the deformable element. For self protection, it aims to provide a high compartment deceleration pulse, similar to the current US NCAP test, to assess a vehicle’s restraint system. This paper describes the benefit predicted for the implementation of improved compatibility in GB and the current status of the FWDB test. For the FWDB test, it clarifies remaining issues including test repeatability and describes the new ‘Structural Interaction’ (SI) criterion. The SI criterion is designed to ensure that vehicles have an adequate structure in a common interaction area to interact with their collision partners and to encourage stable multi-load path structures. It consists of vertical and horizontal components that are divided into parts that could be adopted in a stepwise manner, to allow the gradual development of more compatible vehicles, appropriate for application in a regulatory framework...|$|E
