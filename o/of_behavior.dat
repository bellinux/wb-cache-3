5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> and the understanding <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of self-control procedures on the disruptive, off-task <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> one student in an open concept class. An attempt was made in this study to include the following four components of behavioral self-control as put forth by Glynn, Thomas and Shee (1973) : 1. Self-assessment. The individual may examine his own behavior and decide whether or not he has performed a specific <b>behavior</b> or class <b>of</b> <b>behaviors.</b> 2. Self-recording. The individual may objectively record the frequency of his performance <b>of</b> a given <b>behavior</b> or class <b>of</b> <b>behaviors.</b> 3. Self-determination <b>of</b> reinforcement. The individual may determine from all available reinforcers, the nature and amount of reinforcement he should receive contingent upon his performance <b>of</b> a given <b>behavior</b> or class <b>of</b> <b>behaviors.</b> 4. Self-administration <b>of</b> reinforcement. The individual dispenses his own reinforcement (which may or may not be self-determined) contingent upon his performance <b>of</b> a given <b>behavior</b> or class <b>of</b> <b>behaviors.</b> (Glynn, Thomas & Shee, 1973, p. 105) Honors CollegeThesis (B.

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS), {{also known}} as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> and interests.

Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.|$|E

5|$|Many modern {{birds are}} highly social, often found living in flocks.

5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.

They are just descriptions <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E

5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities <b>of</b> <b>behavior,</b> {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
