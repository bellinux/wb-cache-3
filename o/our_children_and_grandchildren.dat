60|$|Indeed, {{there would}} be no end to this paper if I were even to name half of the portraits that were {{remarkable}} for their execution or interesting by association. There was one picture of Mr. Wardrop, of Torbane Hill, which you might palm off upon most laymen as a Rembrandt; and close by, you saw the white head of John Clerk, of Eldin, that country gentleman who, playing with pieces of cork on his own dining-table, invented modern naval warfare. There was that portrait of Neil Gow, to sit for which the old fiddler walked daily through the streets of Edinburgh arm in arm with the Duke of Athole. There was good Harry Erskine, with his satirical nose and upper lip, and his mouth just open for a witticism to pop out; Hutton the geologist, in quakerish raiment, and looking altogether trim and narrow, and as if he cared more about fossils than young ladies; full-blown John Robison, in hyperbolical red dressing-gown, and every inch of him a fine old man of the world; Constable the publisher, upright beside a table, and bearing a corporation with commercial dignity; Lord Bannatyne hearing a cause, if ever anybody heard a cause since the world began; Lord Newton just awakened from clandestine slumber on the bench; and the second President Dundas, with every feature so fat that he reminds you, in his wig, of some droll old court officer in an illustrated nursery story-book, and yet all these fat features instinct with meaning, the fat lips curved and compressed, the nose combining somehow the dignity of a beak with the good-nature of a bottle, and the very double chin with an air of intelligence and insight. And all these portraits are so pat and telling, and look at you so spiritedly from the walls, that, compared with the sort of living people one sees about the streets, they are as bright new sovereigns to fishy and obliterated sixpences. Some disparaging thoughts upon our own generation could hardly fail to present themselves; but it is perhaps only the sacer vates who is wanting; and we also, painted by such a man as Carolus Duran, may look in holiday immortality upon <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Another {{question}} which was decisive for the inner {{security of the}} Reich and Europe, was the Jewish question. It was uncompromisingly solved after orders and rational recognition. I believe, gentleman, that you know me {{well enough to know}} that I am not a bloodthirsty person; I am not a man who takes pleasure or joy when something rough must be done. However on the other hand, I have such good nerves and such a developed sense of duty - I can say that much for myself - that when I recognise something as necessary I can implement it without compromise. I have not considered myself entitled - this concerns especially the Jewish women <b>and</b> <b>children</b> - to allow the children to grow into the avengers who will then murder <b>our</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> That would have been cowardly.

[...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance and the pictures taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|R
40|$|Lets face it – we all tell stories, at work {{to protect}} a colleague, {{socially}} to present a situation in a more favourable or humorous light, and also in a formal sense to <b>our</b> <b>children</b> or <b>grandchildren</b> <b>and</b> other junior relatives. For me it goes further than that, {{to the way we}} construct our own life narrative which consists of a series of stories we change and alter to fit in with our current world view or aspirations. So when I had the chance to review a book on storytelling I was intrigued. This is an excellent book on the art and ethics of storytelling, my only disappointment was it was not long enough. Spaulding has a conversational writing style which is very pleasantly readable and also allows her to effortlessly digress into interesting asides, Also she writes from a position of considerable moral and ethical authority, for which I have a great respect. I simply wanted her to write for longer so I could keep reading.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to categorize four contemporary challenges as the greatest threats to global well-being and the persistence of humankind. These challenges are global climate and ecological change, poor human health management, violence (or the absence of peace), and poverty <b>and</b> hunger. If <b>our</b> <b>children,</b> <b>grandchildren</b> <b>and</b> great-grandchildren are {{to survive in a}} peaceful world where fruitful progress can occur, these contemporary global challenges must be addressed thoughtfully and collectively as a human species. It is the contention of this paper that there exists an optimal and necessary set of requirements and conditions (at a global and organizational level) that give us the greatest probability of success in tackling these most urgent human challenges. The goal of this thesis is to prove this hypothesis and that these conditions can be explained by causal models as well as empirically tested through historical application and validation and direct application on a real world situation. A simple model for assessment of potential success for addressing the most challenging human endeavors is delivered. Sub-goals include presenting an analysis of the current global approaches to solving the major human challenges and how they can be improved. by Anando A. Chowdhury. Thesis (S.
