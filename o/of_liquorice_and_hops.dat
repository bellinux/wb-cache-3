40|$|Acne vulgaris is {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered dermatological disease of pilosebaceous unit. Androgens, which increase during puberty, stimulate the sebaceous gland to produce sebum and cause retention of keratinocytes around the sebaceous hair follicle orifice causing partial to complete blockage and leading to colonization with Propionibacterium acnes, which participates {{in the production of}} pro inflammatory mediators. For treatment of acne one of the approaches is to reduce sebum production, the main stimulus to acne; then all other pathogenic factors will diminish. A comprehensive approach combining the natural medicine with antiandrogenic activity would be fruitful area for anti-acne therapy.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the in vitro as well as in vivo cariostatic efficacy of aqueous <b>and</b> ethanolic extracts <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> <b>and</b> assess their acceptability among child patients. Materials and Methods: Minimum bactericidal concentrations of aqueous <b>and</b> ethanolic extracts <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> against mutans streptococci were evaluated and their toxicity profiles were tested using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The clinical trial was conducted as a double-blind pilot study where pediatric patients (N = 60), aged 7 - 14 years, were equally divided by randomization into three groups, namely, Group 1 using aqueous liquorice mouthwash (15 %), Group 2 using ethanolic liquorice mouthwash (3. 75 %), and Group 3 using chlorhexidine gluconate (0. 156 %) as positive control. A baseline pre-rinse and three post-rinse saliva samples were evaluated for the changes in pH and mutans streptococci colony counts. Palatability <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> extracts was assessed through a self-designed questionnaire having structured categorical responses. Statistical Analysis: Parametric evaluations were done using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett′s "t" test. Results: The mean mutans streptococci colony counts in all three groups decreased significantly (P < 0. 001) immediately after the oral rinsing. The reduction in colony counts was significant in ethanolic liquorice group as compared to the control (P < 0. 01). Liquorice extracts also led to an immediate rise in salivary pH. The results showed an immediate antimicrobial action <b>of</b> <b>liquorice</b> extracts, with limited retentivity. Conclusion: The study affirms that both aqueous <b>and</b> ethanolic <b>liquorice</b> extracts are potent cariostatic agents and are found to be palatable by child patients...|$|R

In SKMEL- 28 cells, Bcl- 2 expression was low after UVB irradiation, but it was increased when treated with glycyrrhizin. On the contrary, in the SKMEL- 2 cell culture, Bcl- 2 expression was not modified by the substances under study.

40|$|Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used plants in food production, and it can also be used as an herbal {{medicine}} or for reclamation of salt-affected soils. Under salt stress, inhibition of plant growth, nutrient acquisition and symbiotic interactions between the medicinal legume <b>liquorice</b> <b>and</b> rhizobia have been observed. We recently evaluated the interactions between rhizobia and root-colonizing Pseudomonas in liquorice grown in potting soil and observed increased plant biomass, nodule numbers and nitrogen content after combined inoculation compared to plants inoculated with Mesorhizobium alone. Several beneficial effects of microbes on plants have been reported; studies examining the interactions between symbiotic bacteria and root-colonizing Pseudomonas strains under natural saline soil conditions are important, especially in areas where a hindrance of nutrients and niches in the rhizosphere are high.
