5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their <b>own</b> <b>food</b> and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was obsessed}} with his health {{to the point of}} hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as a long list of ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his <b>own</b> <b>food</b> to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not approve of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E

5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their <b>own</b> <b>food</b> and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E
5|$|Born January 9, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, Matt Bevin was {{the second}} of six {{children}} born to Avery and Louise Bevin. He {{grew up in the}} rural town of Shelburne, New Hampshire, in a small farmhouse heated by wood-fired stoves. His father worked at a wood mill, and his mother worked part-time in a hospital admissions department. The family raised livestock and grew much of their <b>own</b> <b>food.</b> At age 6, Bevin made money by packaging and selling seeds to his neighbors. He credits his involvement in 4-H, where he {{served as president of the}} local and county chapters and as a member of the state teen council, with developing his public speaking and leadership skills. He was also involved with the county's Dairy Club.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their <b>own</b> <b>food.</b> Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

5|$|Intellectual men {{of letters}} like the {{versatile}} Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects {{as diverse as}} mathematics, geography, geology, economics, engineering, medicine, art criticism, archaeology, military strategy, and diplomacy, among others. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed {{the total number of}} possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their <b>own</b> <b>food</b> and food for other soldiers. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the gnomon, and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039).|$|E
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their <b>own</b> <b>food</b> (production {{is greater than}} respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E
5|$|The 30 contestants {{were divided}} into three teams of ten named Team 1, Team 2 and Team 3, and each group met in a {{different}} London location on 10 June, {{the day of the}} programme's launch. To record what each team did, Russian hired unpaid trainee cameramen. Once the teams were assembled, they were given their challenge: in a year, they had to make £1million. Their first task was to find accommodation for themselves for free for a week. The contestants slowly realised that, despite what their contracts had claimed, they would have to find their <b>own</b> <b>food</b> and accommodation, and would essentially be making their own prize money. Some contestants demanded to meet with Russian, who eventually revealed to them that no television channel had actually commissioned his show. Teams 1 and 3 disbanded within two days.|$|E

5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their <b>own</b> <b>food</b> and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E
