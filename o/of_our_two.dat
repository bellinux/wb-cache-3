Chamberlain urged restraint {{in the implementation of}} the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed [...] "Anglo–German Agreement", which contained three paragraphs including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement [...] "symbolic of the desire <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>two</b> peoples never to go to war again". According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected [...] "Ja! Ja!" [...] ("Yes! Yes!") as the Prime Minister read it. The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, [...] "Oh, don't take it so seriously. That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever." [...] Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, [...] "I've got it!" [...] Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.|$|E

[...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>two</b> aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke.
