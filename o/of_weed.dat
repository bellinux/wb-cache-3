5|$|The storm sent a {{plume of}} {{moisture}} throughout the Arabian Peninsula, contributing to dust storms {{as far north as}} Iraq. However, the effects were most severe in Yemen, becoming the second-worst natural disaster in the country after deadly floods in 1996. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, reaching around , which caused flash flooding in valleys after waterways were unable to contain the approximately 2billionkm3 (528billion gallons) of water that fell. Poor drainage practices and an invasive species <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> contributed to the floods, which damaged or destroyed 6,505houses, leaving about 25,000people homeless. The floods killed 180people and severely disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents of Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates, mostly farmers whose fields were washed away. Some of the buildings at the Shibam UNESCO World Heritage Site collapsed due to the floods. Overall damage was estimated at US$874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional US$726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at US$1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product.|$|E

25|$|Notably {{absent from}} toleration of drugs is its production, {{particularly}} the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>weed.</b> This {{has led to}} a seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell soft drugs but where production is nearly always punished. Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of soft drug producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing weed in large quantities but refused to punish them. A breakthrough occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law to pass that would partly legalize production <b>of</b> <b>weed.</b> In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental new system in certain cities where coffee shops could legally acquire weed from a state-appointed producer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Weed {{suppression}} and weeding {{are necessary}} measures for rice cultivation. Weed suppression precedes the process <b>of</b> <b>weeding.</b> It means suppressing the growth <b>of</b> young <b>weeds</b> {{and creating a}} weed-less environment. If we suppress the growth <b>of</b> <b>weeds,</b> we can reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>weeds</b> in a paddy field. This {{would result in a}} reduction <b>of</b> the <b>weeding</b> work load. In this paper, we will show how we developed a weed suppression robot for the purpose <b>of</b> reducing the <b>weeding</b> work load. The robot has a laser range finder for autonomous mobility and a robot arm for weed suppression. It travels along the rice rows without stepping on and injuring the rice plants in a paddy field. The robot arm applies force to the weed seedlings and thereby suppresses the growth <b>of</b> <b>weeds.</b> This paper will explain the methodology of the autonomous mobile, the experiment in weed suppression, and the method of controlling the robot’s posture on uneven ground...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study carried out in the years 2005 - 2007 in the Bezek Experimental Farm near the city of Chełm, Poland, on heavy mixed rendzina soil. The effect of intercropping, using red clover (cv. Dajana) and white clover (cv. Astra), on <b>weed</b> infestation <b>of</b> a spring barley crop was studied. The species composition <b>of</b> <b>weeds</b> in the spring barley crop changed to a small extent {{under the influence of the}} application of clover intercropping, whereas the population size of particular species showed large fluctuations. In the spring barley crop with the red clover intercrop, Sonchus arvensis occurred in greatest numbers among dicotyledonous weed species. In the barley crop with white clover and without intercrop, Viola arvensis and Sonchus arvensis were the dominant dicotyledonous species. Setaria pumila was the dominant monocotyledonous species in all the treatments. Intercropping using red and white clover clearly limited the growth and development <b>of</b> <b>weeds.</b> The red clover intercrop in the spring barley crop better reduced the infestation with dicotyledonous weeds and also significantly reduced the number <b>of</b> monocotyledonous <b>weeds</b> and the total number <b>of</b> <b>weeds,</b> whereas the white clover intercrop limited only the number <b>of</b> monocotyledonous <b>weeds.</b> The application <b>of</b> the herbicide Chwastox Extra 300 SL significantly reduced the fresh weight <b>of</b> <b>weeds</b> found in the spring barley crop. The presence of the intercrop resulted in different total numbers <b>of</b> <b>weeds</b> in particular treatments. Intercropping distinctly limited the occurrence <b>of</b> the following <b>weed</b> species: Sonchus arvensis, Fallopia convolvulus, Melandrium album, Amaranthus retroflexus, Veronica arvensis and Medicago lupulina. The investigated intercrop species also reduced the biomass <b>of</b> <b>weeds.</b> The application <b>of</b> the herbicide did not differentiate the number <b>of</b> monocotyledonous <b>weeds,</b> which resulted from the application of Chwastox Extra 300 SL that controls only dicotyledonous species...|$|R

The greatest diversity <b>of</b> <b>weeds</b> was found in the nar-row-leafed lupine crop, while the lowest diversity in maize.

25|$|Industrialist Albert Pope was {{inspired}} by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. He wanted to contract out his first order, however, so he approached George Fairfield <b>of</b> <b>Weed</b> Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878. Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success, and production expanded in the Weed factory, with Weed making every part but the tires. Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the Pope Manufacturing Company. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near {{the turn of the century}} when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} grass by grazing affects the woody plant {{component}} of woodland systems in two major ways. Grasses compete with woody plants for {{water in the}} topsoil and removal by grazing reduces this competitive effect, potentially boosting tree growth. In addition to this effect, the removal of fuel reduces both the intensity {{and the frequency of}} fires which may control woody plant species. Grazing animals can have a more direct effect on woody plants by the browsing of palatable woody species. There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas. Grazing also promotes the spread of weeds in savannas by the removal or reduction of the plants which would normally compete with potential weeds and hinder establishment. In addition to this, cattle and horses are implicated in the spread of the seeds <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> species such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica) and Stylo (Stylosanthes spp.). Alterations in savanna species composition brought about by grazing can alter ecosystem function, and are exacerbated by overgrazing and poor land management practices.|$|E
