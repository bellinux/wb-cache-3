5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b> However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by the energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{the behavior of the}} automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton is guaranteed to obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E
