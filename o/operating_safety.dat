40|$|Abstract Despite the {{introduction}} of the Universal Protocol, patient safety in surgery remains a daily challenge in the operating room. This present study describes one community health system's efforts to improve <b>operating</b> room <b>safety</b> through human factors training and ultimately the development of a surgical checklist. Using a combination of formal training, local studies documenting <b>operating</b> room <b>safety</b> issues and peer to peer mentoring we were able to substantially change the culture of our operating room. Our efforts have prepared us for successfully implementing a standardized checklist to improve <b>operating</b> room <b>safety</b> throughout our entire system. Based on these findings we recommend a multimodal approach to improving <b>operating</b> room <b>safety.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|Reverse thrust mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished.

50|$|Wind {{turbines}} can {{be distributed}} energy resources or they can be built at utility scale. These have low maintenance and low pollution, but distributed wind unlike utility-scale wind has much higher costs than other sources of energy. As with solar, wind energy is variable and non-dispatchable. Wind towers and generators have substantial insurable liabilities caused by high winds, but good <b>operating</b> <b>safety.</b> Distributed generation from wind hybrid power systems combines wind power with other DER systems. One such example is the integration of wind turbines into solar hybrid power systems, as wind tends to complement solar because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year.|$|E

The rounded end ensures the primer is indented rather than pierced, as {{would happen if the}} firing pin were sharply pointed. Most firing pins have a spring to push them out of contact with the primer, and often will have an integrated passive safety mechanism, such as a block that prevents them from moving forward unless the trigger is depressed, or a transfer bar, also trigger actuated, that must be in place to allow the hammer to depress the firing pin. This safety is in addition to any manually <b>operated</b> <b>safety</b> or safeties that act to block the trigger or hammer.|$|R

In this paper, a test bench which can be switched between with refrigerant injection ASHP system and traditional ASHP system for EVs aiming at cold region is developed. In order to analyze the influence of refrigerant injection porthole shapes to system performance, two scroll compressors with different injection portholes are refitted from comment electric compressor. The experiment {{results show that the}} heating capacity of refrigerant injection system is raised up to 27 % than that of the traditional system. The bigger area of injection portholes can and make help to increase the heating capacity when in-car inlet air temperature is higher.
