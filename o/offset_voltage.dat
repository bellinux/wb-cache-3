25|$|Temperature effects: All {{parameters}} {{change with}} temperature. Temperature drift of the input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> is especially important.|$|E
25|$|Input offset voltage: This voltage, {{which is}} what is {{required}} across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, {{there would be no}} input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage.</b> However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of non-idealities of OP AMPs on the {{performance}} of active filters. The non-ideality is considered in terms of finite gain, finite gain-bandwidth product, slew-rate, and <b>offset</b> <b>voltages.</b> The effect of these non-idealities on active RC & switched capacitor filters is highlighted. Some ways of reduction of these effects are also suggested and relative advantages and disadvantages of various compensation techniques are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{output of}} the Rogowski coil is {{proportional}} to the derivative of the wire current. The output is often integrated so the output {{is proportional to the}} wire's current:In practice, an instrument will use a lossy integrator with a time constant much less than the lowest frequency of interest. The lossy integrator will reduce the effects of <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> and set the constant of integration to zero.|$|R
25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> (different from the input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> below) can be produced. This <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermocouple}} produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire {{has a high}} resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E
40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} devices (OLED) were operated using an AC <b>voltage</b> with DC <b>offset</b> (operating <b>voltage).</b> Electroabsorption (EA) signals {{as a function of}} a DC-offset were measured at 2 f. Higher absolute DC <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> lead to a reduction of the EA signal. The effect observed can well be explained in terms of an extended electroabsorption model including Thomas-Fermi screening The AC component of the electric field is shielded clue to charge injection caused by the DC offset This new device characterization technique allows monitoring the charge carrier statistics in the device during operation. It was found that the EA signal indicates the threshold of monopolar and bipolar charge injection, The presence of negative charges enhances drastically the injection and presence of positive charges in the device...|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E
2500|$|How {{to measure}} <b>offset</b> <b>voltage,</b> offset and bias current, gain, CMRR, and PSRR.|$|E
2500|$|A {{resistor}} {{is often}} inserted between the non-inverting input and ground (so both inputs [...] "see" [...] similar resistances), reducing the input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> due to different voltage drops due to bias current, and may reduce distortion in some op-amps.|$|E
5000|$|The voltage of {{an unknown}} {{reference}} [...] relative to the Josephson array voltage is determined using the circuit shown in Fig. 9 (a subset of Fig. 7) in which the unknown and the Josephson array are connected in series opposition across a null meter. A reversing switch is used to eliminate the effect of thermal and other <b>offset</b> <b>voltages.</b> The step number [...] and sometimes the frequency [...] are adjusted to make the null voltage as small as possible. The circuit equation can then be written: ...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{motivation}} {{of the research}} presented here was to understand some novel phenomena reported in compositionally graded ferroelectric films. The phenomenon of primary interest was the translation of ferroelectric hysteresis loops along what is normally regarded as the polarization axis, which was interpreted as a polarization offset with anamolously large and unphysical values. The fabrication of compositionally graded Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 (PZT) thin films is presented along with the observation of hysteresis loop translations. These hysteresis loop translations {{were found to be}} due to a dc <b>voltage</b> <b>offset</b> which develops on the sample capacitor. In addition, these <b>voltage</b> <b>offsets</b> were found {{to be sensitive to the}} oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere in which the films were situated. Similar oxygen dependent <b>voltage</b> <b>offsets</b> were observed for non-graded PZT films. It is proposed that the observed <b>voltage</b> <b>offsets</b> are ultimately the result of a redistribution of oxygen vacancies at the film surface. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of oxygen dependent <b>voltage</b> <b>offsets</b> in yttria stabilized zirconia films. Two models are proposed which attempt to explain how a redistribution of oxygen vacancies might result in the observed <b>voltage</b> <b>offsets.</b> These models are presented along with experimental results which offer insights into their validity. Finally, a course for future studies is recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|A novel circuit is {{presented}} for implementing a bidirectional passive cochlear model in analog VLSI. The circuit includes a subcircuit for modelling the fluid in the cochlear duct, and a subcircuit for modelling the passive basilar membrane. The circuit {{is compared to}} the classical 1 -D transmission line cochlear model and found to be equivalent. The approach leads to an unexpected fa. ult tolerance {{in the form of}} insensitivity to transconductance amplifier <b>offset</b> <b>voltages.</b> A 545 -stage cochlea has been fabricated and demonstrates the expected wave propagation behaviour...|$|R
2500|$|The {{non-inverting}} input of the operational amplifier needs {{a path for}} DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the {{non-inverting input}} to ground. When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced. [...] The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal <b>offset</b> <b>voltage)</b> will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin. [...] That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, {{which may not be}} true for all op-amps.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the extent}} that the input bias {{currents}} do not match, there will be an effective input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op amp offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., [...] "offset null" [...] or [...] "balance" [...] pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.|$|E
5000|$|The input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> of {{amplifiers}} becomes {{important when}} trying to amplify small signals with very high gain. Because this technique creates a very low input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> amplifier, and because this input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> does not change much with time and temperature, these techniques are also called [...] "zero-drift" [...] amplifiers (because there is no drift in input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> with time and temperature). Related techniques that also give these zero-drift advantages are auto-zero and chopper-stabilized amplifiers.|$|E
40|$|We present {{circuits}} for a high-efficiency low-swing interconnect scheme {{suitable for}} the Smart Memories reconfigurable architecture.

50|$|A further {{improvement}} in {{the accuracy of the}} resistance values can be obtained by repeating the resistance measurements after switching polarities of both the current source and the voltage meter. Since this is still measuring the same portion of the sample, just in the opposite direction, the values of Rvertical and Rhorizontal can still be calculated as the averages of the standard and reversed polarity measurements. The benefit of doing this is that any <b>offset</b> <b>voltages,</b> such as thermoelectric potentials due to the Seebeck effect, will be cancelled out.|$|R
