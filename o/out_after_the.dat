5|$|All known extinct lemurs from Madagascar {{are known}} from recent, subfossil remains. Conditions for fossilization were not ideal on the island, so {{little is known}} about ancestral lemur populations. All known extinct lemurs are thought to have died <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> arrival of humans.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Zrinski's {{garrison}} was wiped <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> final battle. Ottoman {{casualties were}} also heavy. Three pashas, 7,000 Janissaries and 28,000 other soldiers {{are said to}} have perished. Sources vary on the exact number with estimates ranging from 20,000–35,000.|$|E
5|$|The Glider Pilot Regiment {{suffered}} the highest proportion of fatal casualties {{during the battle}} (17.3% killed). The regiment was so badly depleted that during Operation Varsity RAF pilots were used to fly many of the gliders. As glider operations were phased <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war, the regiment shrank and was eventually disbanded in 1957.|$|E

5|$|The ruffed lemur genus, Varecia, is {{a member}} of the family Lemuridae. The extinct genus, Pachylemur most closely resembled the ruffed lemurs but died <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> arrival of humans.

5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|In {{his tent}} on the beach, Zurga {{notes that the}} storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (""). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (""). Nourabad {{and some of the}} {{fishermen}} enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> group and seizes the necklace.|$|E

5|$|The Tang dynasty also officially {{recognized}} various foreign religions. The Assyrian Church of the East, {{otherwise known}} as the Nestorian Christian Church, was given recognition by the Tang court. In 781, the Nestorian Stele was created in order to honor the achievements of their community in China. A Christian monastery was established in Shaanxi province where the Daqin Pagoda still stands, and inside the pagoda there is Christian-themed artwork. Although the religion largely died <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Tang, it was revived in China following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The other militia men {{traveled}} on land {{to find the}} place where the Margaretta was anchored and demanded surrender. After refusing to surrender, Moore sailed to where the Polly was anchored and attempted to recover her. There was an inconsequential exchange of gunfire with the militia men who were located on the shore, and Moore was able to raise anchor and travel to a safe anchorage. The remaining men armed themselves with muskets, pitchforks, and axes to set <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Margaretta.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; {{he was ordered to}} attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried <b>out.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> end of the war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, San Martino {{collided}} with Regina Maria Pia {{and had her}} ram bow twisted, causing leaks in her hull. Shortly thereafter, Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces, but his ships, low on coal and ammunition, and with badly demoralized crews, could not be rallied by Persano's half-hearted attempt to launch an attack. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; as night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. San Martino had been hit numerous times, and had her side armor penetrated by one shell, which {{did not succeed in}} penetrating the timber backing. Twice during the engagement, the ship was set on fire by Austrian shells, though her crew was able to put the fires <b>out.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> battle, Vacca replaced Persano; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Headley {{made his}} Jamaica debut against Lord Tennyson's XI at Sabina Park on 9 February 1928, in a match won easily by the home team. Batting at number three, his first innings yielded 16 runs, {{but in the}} second innings, he scored 71, {{reaching}} fifty runs in as many minutes. In the second game against Lord Tennyson's XI which began in Kingston on 18 February, Headley scored his maiden first-class century. Having scored 22 not <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first day's play, he reached 50 runs by playing very carefully but subsequently played more adventurous shots. He hit the bowling of Alan Hilder for four consecutive fours and twice hit Lord Tennyson for three fours in a row. At one point, thirteen of his scoring shots in a row went for four. He was finally out for 211, the highest score at the time by a West Indian batsman against an English team. After the innings, Tennyson compared Headley to Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney, batsmen considered among the best who ever played. Headley concluded the series against Tennyson's team with innings of 40 and 71, {{to give him an}} aggregate of 409 runs at an average of 81.80. He also took his maiden first class wicket.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fourth Test, Bradman scored 62, before being bowled {{attempting}} a pull shot to a ball that kept low, as Australia compiled 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. Bradman rested {{himself in the}} next match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. He then scored 31 and 13 not out, bowled by Eric Hollies as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer and earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he famously dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck. Australia proceeded to face and draw with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Bradman made 28 after being dropped twice in Australia's 321, before taking two catches as the tourists took a 191-run lead. He then came in at 1/16 and put on 161 for the second wicket with Barnes, and was unbeaten on 133 when he declared at 3/265. The home side hung on for a draw at 7/199 when time ran out. Bradman then rested himself during the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that was washed <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first day.|$|E

5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, {{that it was}} possible to breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered the city by assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed the terms of the peace agreement. The commanders finally agreed that the peace terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against the departing Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, it was three days after the surrender of the city that Khalid set <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{counties}} in Texas were declared disaster areas after Tropical Storm Fay: Brazoria, Frio, Galveston, La Salle, Live Oak, Matagorda, Nueces, San Patricio and Wharton. The declaration enabled business owners and residents {{to apply for}} federal and state government aid programs. Disaster housing checks handed <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> storm totaled to over $2.7million (2002USD; $3.1million 2007USD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had carried out over 2,700home and building inspections. Non-government relief programs such as The Individual and Family Grant Program had distributed over $400,000 (2002USD; $469,000 2007USD) in checks, and over $1million (2002USD; $1.2million 2007USD) in relief funds. The Small Business Administration also funded over $250,000 (2002USD; $294,000 2007USD) in relief aid.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July, Vikrant sailed off to Cochin {{in company}} with the Western Fleet. En route, before {{reaching}} Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried <b>out.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> completion of the radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for Madras, escorted by Brahmaputra and Beas. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether {{it was possible to}} embark an Alizé without compromising the speed restrictions. The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Alizé aircraft would have to land at close to stalling speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.|$|E

5|$|On October15, the {{governor}} of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October16. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{unveiling}} a {{new type}} of augmentation that will negate the use of Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by the Tyrants. Adam Jensen attempts to save Megan Reed and her fellow scientists, but Tyrant leader Namir critically wounds him and apparently kills Megan and the scientists. David Sarif uses his most advanced technology to save Adam, giving him superhuman abilities: he also learns that the augmentations are bonding to him naturally without the need for Neuropozyne. Called back to deal with an attack on a Sarif Industries warehouse by anti-augmentation extremists, Adam discovers an augmented hacker attempting {{to gain access to the}} secret Typhoon weapon augmentation. Upon discovery, the hacker is forced by their controller to shoot himself. After Adam retrieves the deceased hacker's neural hub from his old Detroit police precinct, Frank Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a FEMA detention camp, but they are moving <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to Hengsha before killing himself with a grenade.|$|E
5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died <b>out</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E
