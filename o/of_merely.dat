5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{literature}} of antiquity and {{the form of the}} ancient book reciprocally conditioned each other. The context of publication enveloped and modified literary creativity. The dividends of these investigations will thereby far exceed the satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> antiquarian pleasures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map as quickly as possible. Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E

5|$|Both rivals {{together}} with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects. The “Alexandrine” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals, while that of Victorine faction only by five. Supporters of Victor IV, admitting {{that they were in}} minority, justified their action {{by the fact that the}} opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, and the lives <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A Link to the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A Link to the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. A Link to the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{thirteen}} no-hitters pitched by Phillies players, three have been {{won by a}} score of 6–0, and three by a score of 1–0, more common than any other results. The largest margin of victory in a Phillies no-hitter was ten runs, in a 10–0 win by Chick Fraser. Charlie Ferguson's no-hitter, the first in franchise history, was a 1–0 victory, as {{were two of the}} more recent regular season no-hitters, thrown by Kevin Millwood in 2003 and Roy Halladay in 2010. Three pitchers to throw no-hitters for the Phillies have been left-handed: Johnny Lush (in 1906), Terry Mulholland (in 1990) and Cole Hamels (in 2015). The other eight pitchers were right-handed. Halladay is the only Phillies' pitcher to throw more than one no-hitter in a Phillies uniform, and others, including Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, have pitched more than one in their careers. The longest interval between Phillies no-hitters was between the games pitched by Lush and Bunning, encompassing 58 years, 1 month, and 20 days from May 1, 1906 to June 21, 1964. Conversely, the shortest interval between no-hitters was between Halladay's two 2010 no-hitters, with a total <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> four months and seven days from May 29 to October 6; the shortest gap between regular-season no-hitters was between Mulholland's and Tommy Greene's games (nine months and eight days from August 15, 1990 to May 23, 1991). Two opponents have been no-hit by the Phillies more than one time: the San Francisco Giants, who were defeated by Mulholland (in 1990) and Millwood (in 2003); and the Cincinnati Reds, who were no-hit by Rick Wise (in 1971) and Halladay (in 2010).|$|E

25|$|In late August 1956, the French Admiral Pierre Barjot {{suggested}} that Port Said {{once again be}} made the main target, which lessened {{the number of troops}} needed and thus reduced the interval between sending forces to the eastern Mediterranean and the invasion.

Although, due to fear of government repression, its activism was thinly veiled under the guise <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> getting the youth interested in political process, the festival's ties with Otpor! and other forces pushing for regime change were clear to all that attended.|$|E

25|$|Much {{substantive}} {{due process}} litigation involves legal challenges about unenumerated rights that seek particular outcomes instead <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> contesting procedures and their effects.

25|$|On 29 September 2005, the Mothers of Beslan {{called for}} the chief {{prosecutor}} Nikolai Shepel to be replaced for incompetence and claims <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> acting out a scripted prosecution without calling high-ranking Russian officials to testify. On 4 October 2005, the Supreme Court of North Ossetia announced that Shepel would not be replaced, in a disputed ruling. About a month later, the Mothers of Beslan spawned a new group dubbed the Voice of Beslan, which was considered more radical than the former, and courted many of the husbands.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Green, many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; because residential segregation was widespread, little integration was accomplished. In 1971, the Court in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education approved busing as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, {{in the case}} of Milliken v. Bradley (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students between districts, instead <b>of</b> <b>merely</b> within a district. Milliken basically ended the Supreme Court's major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
