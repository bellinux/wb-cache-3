25|$|Bruce Damer and David Deamer {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that cell membranes cannot be formed in salty seawater, and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a superorganism rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, More Fun Comics #101 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Superboy, establishing that Superman began his superhero career as a child. This issue showed Krypton in much greater detail than before, as a scientifically advanced world. Kryptonians {{did not appear to}} possess superhuman powers on Krypton but were aware that a Kryptonian <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> have them. In this story, Superman's biological parents were named Jor-El and Lara. Jor-El attempted to convince the Supreme Council that their world was doomed and that they must take action. The Council scoffed at Jor-El's warnings, so he returned home to save his family, if nobody else. But Jor-El was only able to save his son.|$|E
25|$|Ophiuchus {{is located}} between Aquila, Serpens and Hercules, {{northwest}} {{of the center of}} the Milky Way. The southern part lies between Scorpius to the west and Sagittarius to the east. In the northern hemisphere, it is best visible in summer. It is located opposite Orion in the sky. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent; the interposition of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, which are nonetheless counted as one constellation. Ophiuchus straddles the equator but lies predominately to its south. However, Rasalhague, a fairly conspicuous star in its north, is circumpolar north of 78° north latitude. The constellation extends southward to −30° declination. Segments of the ecliptic that lie within Ophiuchus lie south of −20° declination. A determination of exactly where these stars are visible <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> depend on atmospheric refraction, the Novaya Zemlya effect, mountains and clouds.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, as the world's {{population}} {{passed the}} seven billion mark Ehrlich {{has argued that}} the next two billion people <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> cause more damage than the previous two billion because we are now increasingly having to resort to using more marginal and environmentally damaging resources. As of 2013, Ehrlich continues to perform policy research concerning population and resource issues, with an emphasis upon endangered species, cultural evolution, environmental ethics, and the preservation of genetic resources. Along with Dr. Gretchen Daily, he has performed work in countryside biogeography; that is, the study of making human-disturbed areas hospitable to biodiversity. His research group at Stanford University examines extensively natural populations of the Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis). The population-related disasters Ehrlich predicted have largely failed to materialize, with population growth rates slowing and new food production technologies increasing the food supply faster than the population. Ehrlich endorses his general thesis that the human population is too large, posing a direct threat to human survival and the environment of the planet.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the game}} had [...] "incredible {{role-playing}} potential", {{the concept of}} role-playing rabbits {{can be viewed as}} bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that [...] "most people thought it was stupid" [...] when it was first released. This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says [...] "Oh, how we laughed. 'Who <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>would</b> want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's the point? You can't do anything!'".|$|E
500|$|The four {{movements}} (2,3,5 and 6) placed symmetrically {{around the}} central New Testament {{passage in the}} fourth movement, are all settings of Madrigal-style verse.

Bach set it as an unadorned secco recitative, without arioso episodes, accompanied by bare sustained notes in the continuo. The bass soloist proclaims that God's abundant gifts should be shared with the poor and lowly; and that consideration for the needy, not wealth used for tributes, will find favour with God.|$|E

[...] Several major French cities along the coast were given the designation Festung ("fortress"; [...] "stronghold") by Hitler, such as Le Havre, Brest and St. Nazaire, suggesting that they were to remain under permanent post-war German administration.|$|E
500|$|Before {{giving his}} decision, Tyndareus bound all the suitors to his fateful oath: should anyone ever take his {{daughter}} by force, {{all those who}} had wooed her must exact vengeance upon her abductor. To this all the suitors readily agreed, each believing {{that he would be}} given Helen's hand. At this point the Catalogue of Suitors has come to a close, but even as Menelaus' success is reported, the poet introduces Achilles because of his status as the greatest hero of the Trojan saga and his central role in Zeus's plan to bring the Heroic Age to a close. With the aid of Agamemnon, Menelaus had given the most bride prices, but were Achilles already of age, he would surely have won Helen's hand, [...] "for neither warlike Menelaus nor any other human <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>would</b> have defeated him". But Achilles was not present, and Menelaus won Helen, who bore Hermione to him.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} intended to be frontman Neil Finn's third solo release. [...] In the wake of Paul Hester's death, as well as preparations {{for the release of}} the live album Farewell to the World, the band members were drawn together and their friendship was reinvigorated. [...] In 2006, Neil Finn invited bassist Nick Seymour to participate in the recording of his new album and subsequent tour. In the initial phase, various session musicians filled parts, such as studio musician Joey Waronker on drums and British soul singer Beth Rowley provided backup vocals for the song [...] "Transit Lounge." [...] After recording a complete album with Ethan Johns in the producer and drummer's seat and Seymour contributing substantially throughout the process, Finn decided Crowded House would reform and that Time <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> be the band's fifth studio album.

2500|$|East of Eos and Ganges, Valles Marineris empties {{out into}} the Chryse region of the {{northern}} plains of Mars at an elevation only [...] above the deepest point of Valles Marineris in Melas Chasma. The outflow regions of the northern plains {{are similar to the}} terrain seen at the Mars Pathfinder landing site. A terrestrial counterpart of these outflow channels <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> be the scablands of eastern Washington. The eastern Washington scablands are a result of repeated catastrophic flooding due to the build-up of an ice dam at the head of Lake Missoula in the Late Pleistocene. The ice dam would block the water for a while, but when it broke, the ice would float on top of the ensuing flood and vast areas would be stripped of topsoil and vegetation, leaving a large barren area of 'teardrop' islands, longitudinal grooves and terraced margins. Many of these features are also seen in Martian outflow channels, but on a larger scale.|$|E
2500|$|Peak oil as {{a proper}} noun, or [...] "Hubbert's peak" [...] applied more generally, {{refers to a}} {{predicted}} event: {{the peak of the}} entire planet's oil production. After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>would</b> enter a terminal decline. On the basis of his theory, in a paper he presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1956, Hubbert correctly predicted that production of oil from conventional sources would peak in the continental United States around 1965–1970. [...] His prediction of inevitable decline has been incorrect, but the 1970 peak has yet not been surpassed. Hubbert further predicted a worldwide peak at [...] "about half a century" [...] from publication and approximately 12 gigabarrels (GB) a year in magnitude. In a 1976 TV interview Hubbert added that the actions of OPEC might flatten the global production curve but this would only delay the peak for perhaps 10 years. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction.|$|E
