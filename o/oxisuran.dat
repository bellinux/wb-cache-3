40|$|<b>Oxisuran</b> {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} the Rhesus monkey {{in order to assess}} the suitability of this species as an immunological model for man. The biotransformation pathways observed in the monkey are the same as those seen in rats and dogs. These pathways include the oxidation of <b>oxisuran</b> to a sulfone not found in human plasma or urine. Nevertheless, the monkey may merit immunological evaluation because the half-lives of biotransformation and elimination, although shorter than those exhibited by man, are greater than those in dogs and rats. 2 -[(Methylsulfinyl) acetyl]pyridine (<b>oxisuran)</b> is a novel immunosuppressant which inhibits cell-mediated immune mechanisms without affecting the formation of humoral antibodies in animals (1 - 3). <b>Oxisuran</b> extends the survival of allografts in several species (2 - 4). The observation that this agent is more effective in rats than in dogs (2) appears to correlate with the observed differences in its metabolism in these species (5, 6). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{carcinogenic}} potential of <b>oxisuran,</b> a synthetic immunosuppressive agent, was studied for 80 weeks and 104 weeks in mice and rats, respectively. Groups of 50 mice and 70 rats of each sex received <b>oxisuran</b> at doses of 600, 240, and 40 mg/kg/day as dietary admixtures {{over the entire}} experimental period. Adequate survival rates allowed accurate statistical analysis of diagnosed neoplasia. Increased susceptibility to tumor development was not clearly demonstrated. In mice the only statistically {{significant increase in the}} incidence of malignancy was lung carcinomas in high dose females (P P P P < 0. 01) contributed to an overall decrease in both benign tumors and in the combined benign and malignant tumor rates...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxisuran,</b> 2 -([methylsulfinyl]acetyl) pyridine, has {{previously}} been shown to selectively suppress cell-mediated immunity, as measured by prolongation of allograft survival, without inhibition of humoral immunity. In the present investigation, the influence of this compound on lymphoid cell transfer of delayed hypersensitivity was studied. In actively sensitized animals, including endotoxin-sensitized mice and rabbits, ovalbumin-, dinitrochlorobenzene-, and dinitrofluorobenzene-sensitive guinea pigs, or tuberculin-sensitive rats, daily treatment during the interval just preceding the elicitation and expression of the hypersensitivity was most inhibitory. In both endotoxin-sensitive mice and ovalbumin-sensitive guinea pigs, treatment of the sensitized cell donor just prior to lymphoid cell harvest and transfer resulted in inhibition of {{the expression of the}} hypersensitivity in untreated recipients. Approximately 104 fewer specifically sensitized lymphoid cells, but not fewer viable cells, were present in passively transferred cell preparations. In contrast, treatment of the lymphoid cell recipient in the same experimental model did not influence the expression of the transferred hypersensitivity. The results suggest that <b>oxisuran</b> may influence an as yet undefined event prior to the expression of a cell-mediated hypersensitivity response in sensitized animals...|$|E
40|$|Male New Zealand white rabbits with {{subcutaneous}} polyethylene chambers {{in place}} for at least 3 months were inoculated {{by one of the}} following three methods: (i) "intra-chamber" (IC) inoculation with "normal" chamber fluid: (ii) intratesticular inoculation with Treponema pallidum; or (iii) IC inoculation with T. pallidum. Rabbits given dexamethasone only, <b>oxisuran</b> only, both drugs, or no drug were observed serially after inoculation. T. pallidum survived and temporarily multiplied to significant numbers within subucutaneous chambers after IC inoculation in rabbits given dexamethasone. In rabbits not treated with dexamethasone, T. pallidum counts in chamber fluid decreased rapidly and remained at low levels for 30 days after IC inoculation. <b>Oxisuran</b> appeared to have little or no effect on T. pallidum multiplication. All rabbits studied had a nonreactive serum and chamber fluid serological test for syphilis before inoculation. All rabbits inoculated with T. pallidum eventually developed reactive serum and chamber fluid serological tests. The IC route of inoculation was associated with a delay in the development of serum serological reactivity and with earlier chamber fluid reactivity as compared with the intratesticular route of inoculation. An immediate but transent influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was associated with IC inoculation of T. pallidum. Chamber fluid total protein content declined very slightly in all groups of rabbits during the month after inoculations. Successful cultivation of T. pallidum in an in vivo setting suggests that this animal model may be useful in further studies of the biology of the organism of the pathogenesis, immunology, and treatment of syphilis...|$|E
40|$|A new immunosuppressant, 2 -(4 '-chlorophenyl) benzothiopyrano-(4, 3 -c) pyrazol- 3 -one, i. e. CP- 17, 193 was {{compared}} to several standard immunosuppressants with respect to its ability to depress immune responses to two antigens, EL 4 tumour cells and sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). The order of suppressive potency on a weight basis was methotrexate greater than CP- 17, 193 greater than cyclophosphamide greater than 6 -mercaptopurine greater than azathioprine greater than <b>oxisuran</b> for both antigens. In general, it took more immunosuppressant to inhibit the response to SRBC than to EL 4. This resulted in a different therapeutic index for immunosuppression against each antigen. CP- 17, 193 and cyclophosphamide preferentially inhibited the humoral immune response and were the only agents demonstrating such selectivity. CP- 17, 193 's favourable therapeutic index and its structural dissimilarity from the antimetabolite and alkylating immunosuppressants suggests that it may act through a novel mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{system is}} described {{which allows the}} study of the effect of immunosuppressors upon the priming and generation of memory to an antigen from Escherichia coli. A single dose of bacterial beta-D-galactosidase without adjuvant injected into C 57 B 1 / 6 J mice primes and elicits memory but not antibodies. Thus by administering immunosuppressors near the priming injection, one can examine whether primary antibody formation is enhanced and whether priming generation of memory is enhanced or inhibited. We found that X-rays, cyclophosphamide and <b>oxisuran</b> (2 -[(methylsulfinyl) acetyl]pyridine) either enhance or inhibit the elicitation of memory, depending on dosage, although they do not alter primary antibody unresponsiveness. The data show two main features: (a) immunosuppressors can enhance immunization; and (b) generation of memory can be improved without increasing antibody levels. The former finding draws attention to the role that immunosuppressors might play in the breaching of tolerance to self-antigens which share determinants with microbes, while the latter observation shows that antibody synthesis and elicitation of memory can follow independent pathways...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of various {{immunosuppressive}} drugs on the growth of human-derived T (MOLT- 4) and B (MGL- 8) lymphoblasts. In addition, we have examined whether the lymphotoxic effect {{of any of these}} drugs could be attributed to inhibition of either adenosine deaminase (DDA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Results indicated that 1 -[beta] [...] arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), methotrexate and chlorambucil were four to seven times more toxic for T than for B cells, while azathioprine, 6 -thioguanine, 6 -mercaptopurine, and 5 -fluorouracil were highly toxic for both T and B cells. Cyclophosphamide and <b>oxisuran</b> were lymphotoxic only at concentrations exceeding 300 [mu]M. Deoxyadenosine (50 [mu]M), deoxyguanosine (10 [mu]M) and deoxycoformycin (10 [mu]M) failed to enhance T cell toxicity when individually combined with each drug. None of the drugs tested inhibited T or B lymphoblast ADA or PNP activity. With the exception of Ara-C, neither dATP nor dGTP accumulated in T lymphoblasts incubated in the presence of any of the drugs. We conclude that the cell culture system used in this investigation is useful for identifying lymphotoxic and T cell-specific immunosuppressive agents. However, none of the drugs studied appeared to function as an inhibitor of, or a competitive substrate for, either ADA or PNP...|$|E
