5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Hartman was {{preparing}} to voice Zapp Brannigan, a character written specifically for him on Groening's second animated series Futurama. Even though the role was made for Hartman, he still insisted on auditioning and according to Groening, he 'nailed it'. After Hartman's death, Futuramas lead character Philip J. Fry was named in his honour, and Billy West took over the role of Brannigan. Though executive producer David X. Cohen credits West with using his own take on the character, West later said that he purposely tweaked Zapp's voice to better match Hartman's intended portrayal. Hartman was also planning to appear with Lovitz in the indie film The Day <b>of</b> <b>Swine</b> and Roses, scheduled to begin production in August 1998.|$|E

40|$|Genetically {{modified}} swine hold {{great promise}} {{in the fields}} of agriculture and medi-cine. Currently, these swine are being used to optimize production of quality meat, to improveour understandingof thebiologyof disease resistance, and to reducedwaste. In the field <b>of</b> biomedicine, <b>swine</b> are anatomically and physiologically analogous to humans. Alterations <b>of</b> key <b>swine</b> genes in disease pathways provide model animals to improve our understanding of the causes and potential treatments of many human genetic disorders. The completed sequencing <b>of</b> the <b>swine</b> genome will significantly enhance the specificity of genetic modifications, and allow for more accurate repre-sentations of human disease based on syntenic genes between the two species. Improvements in both methods of gene alteration and efficiency of model animal production are key to enabling routine use <b>of</b> these <b>swine</b> models in medicine and agriculture...|$|R
5|$|Successive Merina {{sovereign}}s ruled {{over the}} Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona's reign. This sovereign gave the growing city its current name; he established the Andohalo town square {{outside the town}} gate, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely. Andriamasinavalona designated specific territories for the hova (commoners) and each andriana (noble) subcaste, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced; members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others. Numerous fady (taboos), including injunctions against the construction of wooden houses by non-nobles and the presence <b>of</b> <b>swine</b> within the city limits, were imposed.|$|E
