5|$|With 4:50 {{remaining}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> and {{the ball}} on their own eight-yard line, Maryland drove 89yards to the Wolfpack three-yard line, which included a pass to Davin Meggett for 31yards. This set up a 20-yard field goal attempt by Obi Egekeze with eightseconds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> The kick was good and put Maryland ahead for good, 27–24.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the Wake Forest kickoff, however, Georgia Tech's hopes were quickly deflated by three plays {{that resulted in}} negative yardage or no gain. Georgia Tech was forced into its final punt of the game, and Wake Forest received the ball and ran out the remaining time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> Wake Forest won the 2006 ACC Championship Game by a 96 score.|$|E

50|$|Everyday clocks such as {{wristwatches}} have finite precision. Eventually {{they require}} correction to remain accurate.

Thus <b>the</b> same <b>clock</b> can have different drift rates at different occasions.|$|R
5|$|Clemson {{received}} Georgia Tech's kickoff with 1:20 {{remaining in}} the game. On the Tigers' first play, they committed a 10-yard penalty. Two incomplete passes followed from Parker, who then completed an 18-yard throw to Xavier Dye. This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, who needed to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied {{in his attempt to}} run for the needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs. Georgia Tech's offense ran out the remaining seconds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and ensured their 39–34 victory.|$|E
5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E

5|$|That {{was good}} for {{first place in the}} AFC Central and a trip to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad snap. In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E
5|$|The family {{returned}} to Needham in 1971, where Baker attended Needham High School.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{players and}} coaches {{attempted}} to leave the field, only to be informed that Indiana called a timeout with one second remaining. Despite Tech head coach Frank Beamer's protests, Indiana's Manolopoulos was {{able to return to}} the field to attempt a 51-yard goal. The kick was blocked and the ball recovered by Tech's Antonio Banks, who returned it 80yards for a touchdown. The score, which came with no time remaining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> gave Tech a 2813 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|After a goalless first half, Corinthian {{went ahead}} {{early in the}} second half with a goal from Gilbert Ashton. There were a large number of attacks from both sides, but it took until the 77th minute before Cardiff {{equalised}} with a header by Hughie Ferguson after a series of passing plays. With only a few minutes remaining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> Cardiff won a corner kick and from the cross, and Len Davies tapped the ball into the net to put them ahead. The game finished with the score two goals to one in Cardiff City's favour.

5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|Georgia {{began its}} first {{possession}} with a 25-yard kickoff return, {{but failed to}} earn a first down {{in the face of}} a tough Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A breakdown in special teams coverage by Georgia allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56yards back to the original line of scrimmage. As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E
