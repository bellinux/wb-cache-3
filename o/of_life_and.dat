40|$|Administration of {{the same}} Quality <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Enjoyment <b>and</b> Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) in major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) and in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before and after treatment allowed us to compare quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction in these two disorders and to compare outcome based on symptoms versus functioning. Q-LES-Q and symptom-specific Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) data from eight randomized, 8 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with escitalopram were used. MDD (n= 1, 140) or GAD (n= 1, 045) patients report a substantial degree <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction impairment (baseline scores 64 % and 76 % of community norm, respectively). Treatment resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction. The improvement was greater in patients treated with escitalopram than with placebo. In MDD, the majority of remitters (MADRS<or= 12) reached 'normal' quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction levels, whereas in GAD, 67 % of remitters (HAMA<or= 7) reached 'normal' quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> enjoyment, <b>and</b> satisfaction. A strong correlation between the symptom-specific scales and the Q-LES-Q was observed. These analyses suggest that remission with scores of 6 on the MADRS and 5 on the HAMA correspond with a quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction found in community comparison patients (Q-LES-Q score of 58 +/- 10 %). Treatment with escitalopram results in a significant improvement <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction in patients with MDD or GAD. Both response and remission in patients with GAD and remission in patients with MDD are correlated with a 'normal' quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> interactions among different forms <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> between life and non-life.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of Pilates and walking on quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> depression, <b>and</b> anxiety levels. Methods: Sixty-three overweight/obese {{participants}} were randomly divided into: control (n = 20), walking (n = 21), and Pilates (n = 22) groups. Pilates and walking groups attended eight weeks of 60 -minute exercise sessions three times per week. Quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> depression, <b>and</b> state- and trait-anxiety levels were evaluated before and after eight weeks of training. Results: Scores <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> depression, <b>and</b> trait-anxiety improved in the Pilates and walking groups. State-anxiety levels improved only in the walking group. Conclusion: Pilates and walking positively impact quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> depression <b>and</b> anxiety.
