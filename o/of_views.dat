5000|$|Many optical instruments, {{particularly}} binoculars or spotting scopes, are advertised {{with their}} field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> specified {{in one of}} two ways: angular field <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and linear field <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Angular field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is typically specified in degrees, while linear field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is a ratio of lengths. For example, binoculars with a 5.8 degree (angular) field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> might be advertised as having a (linear) field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 102 mm per meter. As long as the FOV is less than about 10 degrees or so, the following approximation formulas allow one to convert between linear and angular field <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Let [...] be the angular field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> in degrees.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the quantification <b>of</b> Field <b>of</b> <b>View</b> <b>of</b> external Rear <b>View</b> Mirror in automobiles. The {{decision based on}} available Field <b>of</b> <b>View</b> and the blind zone for lane changing {{is one of the}} major factors in road accident. This study presents a preliminary study of quantifying field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> rear <b>view</b> mirror in automotive vehicles. A simple method of estimating the Field <b>of</b> <b>View</b> is shown and also a passive method of increasing the Field <b>of</b> <b>View</b> is discussed. The proposed method helps the designers and road users to choose the mirror of right size to provide extra field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> beyond the regulatory requirements...|$|R

5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness <b>of</b> <b>views</b> and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident.

I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the votes}} in {{parliament}} was a personal antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, {{the leader of the}} LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the de facto leaders of the party's two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation <b>of</b> <b>views</b> within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on the issue of electoral reform.|$|E
5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} <b>of</b> <b>views</b> {{about the}} {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mindâ€“body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is usually {{expressed}} as an angular area {{viewed by the}} instrument, in square degrees, or for higher magnification instruments, in square arc-minutes. For reference the Wide Field Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope has a field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 10 sq. arc-minutes, and the High Resolution Channel of the same instrument has a field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 0.15 sq. arc-minutes. Ground based survey telescopes have much wider fields <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The photographic plates used by the UK Schmidt Telescope had a field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 30 sq. degrees. The 1.8 m (71 in) Pan-STARRS telescope, with the most advanced digital camera to date has a field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 7 sq. degrees. In the near infra-red WFCAM on UKIRT has a field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 0.2 sq. degrees and the VISTA telescope has a field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 0.6 sq. degrees. Until recently digital cameras could only cover a small field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> compared to photographic plates, although they beat photographic plates in quantum efficiency, linearity and dynamic range, {{as well as being}} much easier to process.|$|R
40|$|Field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{has always}} been a design feature {{paramount}} to helmet design, and in particular spacesuit design, where the helmet must provide an adequate field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> for a large range of activities, environments, and body positions. Historically, suited field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> has been evaluated either qualitatively in parallel with design or quantitatively using various test methods and protocols. As such, oftentimes legacy suit field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> information is either ambiguous for lack of supporting data or contradictory to other field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> tests performed with different subjects and test methods. This paper serves to document a new field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> testing method that is more reliable and repeatable than its predecessors. It borrows heavily from standard field of vision tests such as the Goldmann kinetic perimetry test, but is designed specifically for evaluating field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> a spacesuit helmet. In this test, three suits utilizing three different helmet designs were tested for field <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Not only do these tests provide more reliable field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> data for legacy and prototype helmet designs, they also provide insight into how helmet design impacts field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> and what this means for the Constellation Project spacesuit helmet, which must meet stringent field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> requirements that are more generous to the crewmember than legacy designs...|$|R
5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxiaâ€²s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange <b>of</b> <b>views.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Rossier was in Siam, {{where he}} {{assisted}} the French zoologist Firmin Bocourt by taking ethnographic portraits for the latter's scientific expedition of 18611862, and in 1863, Negretti and Zambra issued {{a series of}} 30 stereographic portraits and landscapes taken in Siam that are almost certainly the work of Rossier. In February 1862, Rossier was again in Shanghai, where he sold his cameras and other photographic equipment before embarking for Europe. During his time in Asia {{it is possible that}} Rossier photographed in India; Negretti and Zambra issued a series <b>of</b> <b>views</b> of India {{at about the same time}} as Rossier's China views.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the novels of}} Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. from the aspect <b>of</b> point <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> refers to the reflective mind through which a reader perceives the story. Traditionally, the narrator delivers his narrative in either first or third person point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> but Vonnegut frequently mixes points <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Mixed point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> presents a particular challenge to the oral interpreter and the adapter/director of readers theatre scripts. The narrator and the narrative structure are discussed, as well as numerous innovative narrative techniques. Suggestions are made for script adaptations and production direction featuring the narrative structure and point <b>of</b> <b>view...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set <b>of</b> <b>views.</b> An early example of {{this kind of}} camera system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochÃ¨re. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama <b>of</b> <b>views.</b> To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, {{the council}} {{repeated}} the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some {{who failed to}} comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Zurich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread {{to other parts of}} the Confederation as well as a number of Swabian towns. On 6â€“8 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the GrossmÃ¼nster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange <b>of</b> <b>views</b> as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.|$|E
40|$|Field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{has always}} been a design feature {{paramount}} to helmet design, and in particular space suit design, where the helmet must provide an adequate field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> for a large range of activities, environments, and body positions. For Project Constellation, a slightly different approach to helmet requirement maturation was utilized; one that was less a direct function of body position and suit pressure and more a function of the mission segment in which the field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is required. Through taxonimization of various parameters that affect suited FOV, as well as consideration for possible nominal and contingency operations during that mission segment, a reduction process was able to condense the large number of possible outcomes to only six unique field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> angle requirements that still captured all necessary variables without sacrificing fidelity. The specific field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> angles were defined by considering mission segment activities, historical performance of other suits, comparison between similar requirements (pressure visor up versus down, etc.), estimated requirements from other teams for field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (Orion, Altair, EVA), previous field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> tests, medical data for shirtsleeve field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> performance, and mapping of visual field data to generate 45 degree off-axis field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> requirements. Full resolution of several specific field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> angle requirements warranted further work, which consisted of low and medium fidelity field <b>of</b> <b>view</b> testing in the rear entry ISuit and DO 27 helmet prototype. This paper serves to document this reduction progress and followup testing employed to write the Constellation requirements for helmet field <b>of</b> <b>view...</b>|$|R

In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>views</b> on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid {{may result in a}} temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb {{pointed out}} a letter {{published}} in The Times in July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number <b>of</b> <b>views</b> from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised {{that the majority of the}} beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the use of the first person point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> in Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. The Woman in White is a novel of mystery. The use of the first person point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> more than one characters is suitable to reveal the mystery of the story. It is through Walter Hartright's point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Marian Halcombe's point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Vincent Gilmore's point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and Count Fosco's point <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The narrators' interpretations on the story's actions are limited. For by using the first person point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> they can tell only what they know and observe by themselves. They cannot report the thoughts and feelings of other characters for they cannot enter their minds. However these limitations have their advantages. The narrators' separate reports create a unity of the story. Their reports then reveal the story's mystery. Therefore the use of the first person point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is effective for it can create the suspense and the tension of the novel...|$|R
