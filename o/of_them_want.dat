The three get progressively more paranoid and Bart becomes convinced that the other two are conspiring against him.|$|E
5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>want</b> to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E

In an April 2015 interview, however, Osbourne said that these plans [...] "could change", and added, [...] "We all live in different countries and some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to work {{and some of them}} don't want to, I believe. But {{we are going to do}} another tour together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{her work}} in {{internet}} addiction, Orzack returned to the area that originally started her research into addiction and started re-examining computer games. Orzack believes that the root of gaming addiction comes from the need of excitement in life, stating that [...] "these people are avoiding their own problems. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> excitement, some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> relief". She also stated that the numbers of computer game addicts in the United States is high, although actual figures are unclear. Orzack felt {{that many of those}} she treated for computer game addiction were in their 40's or older, with them being almost exclusively male. She stated that she almost always heard of a case of this type after it has caused problems with someone's job or marriage.|$|E

It's ridiculous, they don't use it wisely. .... There are a lot of uncreative people in a creative industry.

2500|$|Hippies {{were often}} pacifists, {{and participated in}} non-violent {{political}} demonstrations, such as Civil Rights Movement, the marches on Washington D.C., and anti–Vietnam War demonstrations, including draft-card burnings and the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests. The degree of political involvement varied widely among hippies, from those who were active in peace demonstrations, to the more anti-authority street theater and demonstrations of the Yippies, the most politically active hippie sub-group. Bobby Seale discussed the differences between Yippies and hippies with Jerry Rubin, who told him that Yippies were the political wing of the hippie movement, as hippies have not [...] "necessarily become political yet". Regarding the political activity of hippies, Rubin said, [...] "They mostly prefer to be stoned, but most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> peace, and they want {{an end to this}} stuff." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{think it}} will be needless to enumerate all the {{particular}} simple ideas belonging to each sense. Nor indeed is it possible if we would; there being a great many more of them belonging to most of the senses than we have names for. The variety of smells, which are as many almost, if not more, than species of bodies in the world, do most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> names. Sweet and stinking commonly serve our turn for these ideas, which in effect is little more than to call them pleasing or displeasing; though the smell of a rose and violet, both sweet, are certainly very distinct ideas. Nor are the different tastes, that by our palates we receive ideas of, much better provided with names. Sweet, bitter, sour, harsh, and salt are almost all the epithets we have to denominate that numberless variety of relishes, which are to be found distinct, not only in almost every sort of creatures, but in the different parts of the same plant, fruit, or animal. The same may be said of colours and sounds. I shall, therefore, in the account of simple ideas I am here giving, content myself to set down only such as are most material to our present purpose, or are in themselves less apt to be taken notice of though they are very frequently the ingredients of our complex ideas; amongst which, I think, I may well account solidity, which therefore I shall treat of in the next chapter.|$|E
60|$|With {{the storm}} came {{a change of}} weather; and the {{stronger}} the wind blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colder it got. Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms and things began to flock {{in out of the}} wet and crawl down inside my armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough, and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still, but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what; especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again. It would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not roll or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the different sorts of animals and makes every last one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worse than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder, too, if you can. Still, if one did not roll and thrash around he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other; there is no real choice. Even after I was frozen solid I could still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment. I said I would never wear armor after this trip.|$|E
50|$|The Young Turks, {{mainly the}} district-level members {{with the more}} radical-minded and {{grassroots}} interests had very diverse goals.

Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>wanted</b> to push the party towards a more pro-grassroots position with street actions.|$|R
