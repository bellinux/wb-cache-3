30|$|The goal in STeLLA work is for {{teachers}} and students to develop understandings of key science ideas and related crosscutting concepts {{through the use of}} science practices such as analyzing and interpreting data and constructing explanations (STeLLA strategies 4 and 5, see Fig.  2). This aligns with the emphasis in the NGSS that school science learning should parallel how scientists use science practices to develop conceptual understandings of the world around us (NGSS Lead States 2013). By developing understandings of key science ideas through such evidence-based reasoning, we expect students and teachers {{to be able to use}} and apply these ideas to analyze, interpret, and/or explain new data or phenomena that they encounter (STeLLA strategy 6, see Fig.  2). For this reason, our assessments include reasoning items which challenge students and teachers to use their understandings of core science ideas to analyze or explain data <b>or</b> <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> are new to them.|$|E

Probabilistic models of cog-nition use Bayes ’ rule to identify probable structures <b>or</b> <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> could have generated a set of observations, whether the observations are sensory input or the output of other psycholog-ical processes. In this chapter we address an important question that arises within this framework: How do people infer representations that are complex enough to faithfully encode the world but not so complex that they “overfit” noise in the data? We discuss nonparametric Bayesian models as a potential answer to this question. To do so, first we present the mathematical background nec-essary to understand nonparametric Bayesian models. We then delve into nonparametric Bayesian models for three types of hidden structure: clusters, features, and functions. Finally, we conclude with a summary and discussion of open questions for future research...|$|E

The four targets independently differed in the degree (low versus high) to which they embodied two ‘Big Five ’ personality dimensions: agreeableness and ex-traversion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine under what {{conditions}} it makes sense to say that we are capable of perceiving actions performed by other agents as intentional and, thus, of identifying the intentions governing these actions. Whether it makes sense to say that intentions can be perceived rather then inferred depends in part on what notion of intention one has in mind. The first step in the paper will therefore involve specifying the notion of intention at stake. Two rather different conceptions of intentions and intentional action should be distinguished: one stresses their relation to reasons, the other their executive dimension. On the former view, to say that someone acts intentionally or with an intention is simply to say that she acts for reasons, i. e., that some appropriate relation obtains between the agent's beliefs and desires and her actions. The latter view stresses the executive dimension of intentions, their role as plans <b>or</b> <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> guide and control the action. On this latter view, an action is intentional if it is caused by representations that guide and control its unfolding. It is also important to stress that, on both views, intentions can form hierarchies: there may be hierarchies of reasons for a given action or it may be that intentions considered as elements of an action plan are themselves hierarchically organized...|$|E

40|$|In many {{applications}} in science, engineering and mathematics, {{it is useful}} to understand functions depending on time and/or space from many different points of view. Accordingly, a wide range of transformations and analysis tools have been developed over time. Fourier series and the Fourier transform, first proposed almost 200 years ago, provided one of the first mechanisms to write a complex waveform as the linear combination of elementary wave functions; many more would follow. Nearly 100 years ago, it became clear that for some applications it is especially useful that the elementary ‘building block functions’, into which more complex signals are decomposed, have a limited spread in both time and frequency—transformations <b>or</b> <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> used such simultaneous time–frequency (or space/spatial frequency) localization have been important tools in micro-local arguments in mathematics, quantum mechanics and semi-classical approximations, and many types of signal and data analysis. Typically, the tools used to compute such transforms or representations are linear in the input—making them (fairly) easy to implement, and versatile instruments in the data analyst’s toolbox. Yet, in some cases, the very versatility of these linear tools makes them come up short, and to obtain a more detailed, precise analysis, it becomes necessary to adapt parameters and procedures to (often local) behaviour changes of the data or signal. Examples of this abound. With the advances of sensor technology, we are dealing with vast increases in not only the volume of data to be analysed, but also in their quality—leading to the ubiquitous discussions {{of what to do with}} all these ‘big data’. Big data provide not only a challenge, but also an opportunity, especially because computation and storage have likewise become much more powerful. In response to these needs and opportunities, adaptive data analysis methods are being developed and explored for many different scientific and engineering frameworks...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{analyses}} Michel Faber’s neo-Victorian novel, The Crimson Petal and the White, focusing {{in particular}} on olfactory images <b>or</b> <b>representations</b> <b>that</b> {{create a sense}} of the unfamiliar within the familiar conventions of narrative realism. Smells often haunt our memory in many unpredictable ways. Faber’s high awareness of the olfactory modality is in tension with his own cultural memory and with the task of “remembering the Victorian novel” (Schor) – a task he shares with other contemporary writers. The essay is divided into four sections. The first section focuses on what scientists, from different fields, still call the mystery of smell. I describe some of the characteristics that distinguish smell from the other senses – characteristics that have some interesting implications on how smells are represented in literature – as well as the evanescent, ghostly nature of odours. I then analyse Faber’s post-realist approach to the imagined world of the past and the structure of sensations upon which his novel is built. Faber’s post-realism, I argued, is a question of re-naming or signifying matter, the historical ‘real’, by appealing to sense perceptions: the character’s own perceptions of their material world – amplified beyond proportions [...] as well as the reader’s second order perceptions of the “proposed world” of the text. Smells occur with remarkable regularity in this narrative. They are not quantitatively more relevant than visual descriptions, but they are qualitatively different, especially when used to deflate the comforts of realism. The return of Victorian odours in Faber’s novel produces uncanny effects within the familiar conventions of realistic discourse: olfactory ghosts disrupt the homely and the ordinary, muddling the flattened image of the “doxological Victorians” that heritage culture promotes. Olfaction is also historicized, as the male protagonist is in the business of perfumery and therefore actively involved in the deodorizing project of nineteenth-century civilization. The final section addresses the question of the relationship between history and fiction and the present-day relevance of Victorian culture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{overview}} of the state-of-the-art on semantics extraction from images is presented. In this survey, we present the relevant approaches in terms of content representation {{as well as in}} terms of knowledge representation. Knowledge can be represented in either implicit or explicit fashion while the image is represented in different levels, namely, low-level, intermediate and semantic level. For each combination of knowledge and image representation, a detailed discussion is addressed that leads to fruitful conclusions for the impact of each approach. 1 Semantics extraction basic pipeline Semantics extraction refers to digital data interpretation from a human point of view. In the case that the digital data correspond to images, this usually entails an appearance-based inference using color, texture and/or shape information along with a type of context inference (<b>or</b> <b>representation)</b> <b>that</b> can combine and transform these machine-extracted evidence into what we call a scene description.
