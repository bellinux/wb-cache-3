500|$|During {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Roberts emphasized her work on health care issues and her experience working with Representative Larson in the legislature, and criticized the passage of constitutional amendments creating conflicting fiscal obligations. Although both Roberts and her main opponent, Democrat Joe Colgan, signed a clean campaign pledge, controversy arose over advertisements run by outside sources. In particular, Roberts denounced as [...] "misleading" [...] and [...] "unacceptable" [...] a television advertisement criticizing Colgan's record as mayor of Durango. The ad, which was run by a political group associated with the Colorado Association <b>of</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Builders,</b> was later pulled off the air. Direct mail flyers sent by right-leaning outside groups during the last weeks of the campaign also misrepresented both candidates' stances on immigration, exaggerating the contrast between their positions.|$|E
500|$|Preservationists were {{critical}} {{of how the}} York Row houses were preserved. Calling them [...] "facadectomies", {{vice president of the}} Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia J. Randall Cotton felt that saving the facades did not preserve the essence of the buildings, but that it was better than nothing. Cotton said, [...] "At the eyeball level, it will give something of the coherence of the Philadelphia cityscape, which is a human scale. The beauty of Philadelphia is that its lots were 20 to 25 feet, which allowed for a door and two windows. It's a falsehood to put a big building behind them. But it's preferable to demolition." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron was critical of the parking garage on the lower floors, saying it [...] "detracts from [...] crisp, vertical lines and bumps clumsily against the historic buildings. The garage also makes the tower feel distant from the life of the city." [...] The St. James has won several awards, including the 2006 National Association <b>of</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Builders</b> awards for Best Luxury Rental Apartment Primary Market and Best High-Rise Rental Apartment.|$|E
