40|$|In this project, {{the topic}} of {{automatic}} <b>optical</b> music <b>recognition</b> was studied. It is the conversion of an optically sampled image of a musical score into a representation that can be conveniently stored in computer storage and retrieved for various purpose. It is analogous to <b>optical</b> character <b>recognition.</b> <b>Optical</b> character <b>recognition</b> recognizes text characters in the input images and output the text in a machine-readable format. Similarly, an <b>optical</b> music <b>recognition</b> system recognizes the symbols on a musical score and output the results in a binary format. Subsequent processing on this output can provide {{a wide variety of}} applications, such as reprinting and archiving. In section 1, I will give an introduction to this topic.

50|$|PDFtoMUSIC by Myriad {{is often}} seen as a Music OCR software, but it does {{actually}} no optical character recognition. The program simply reads PDF files which have been created by some scorewriter, locates the musical glyphs which have been written directly as characters of a music notation font. The <b>optical</b> <b>recognition</b> consists of concluding the musical relationship of those glyphs from their relative position in space, i.e. on the logical page of the PDF document, and combine those to a musical score. Only the PRO version can export this to a MusicXML file, while the standard version works only for the scorewriters by Myriad.|$|E

50|$|With {{regard to}} host location, female {{mosquitoes}} hunt their blood host by detecting organic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol produced from the host, and through <b>optical</b> <b>recognition.</b> Mosquitoes prefer some people over others. The preferred victim's sweat simply smells better than others' {{because of the}} proportions of the carbon dioxide, octenol and other compounds that make up body odor. The most powerful semiochemical that triggers the keen sense of smell of Culex quinquefasciatus is nonanal. Another compound identified in human blood that attracts mosquitoes is sulcatone or 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, especially for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the odor receptor gene Or4. A {{large part of the}} mosquito’s sense of smell, or olfactory system, is devoted to sniffing out blood sources. Of 72 types of odor receptors on its antennae, at least 27 are tuned to detect chemicals found in perspiration. In Aedes, the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants, then it follows a targeted approach.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, USPTO {{announced}} {{new regulations}} under 37 CFR (published August 21, 2007) that would significantly alter procedures regarding continuation application before the USPTO. Previously, USPTO rules allowed an inventor to file as many continuations {{as necessary to}} get desired breadth of claims. The procedure was criticized for creating uncertainty {{as to what is}} covered or could be covered by a given patent application. An inventor, for example, could have sought to get claims with limited scope approved early, and then continue to file continuations over many years seeking broader coverage. For example, inventor Jerome H. Lemelson filed a series of continuations over thirty years to get a very broad patent on bar code readers. This patent was issued in 1984, long after bar code readers had {{become an integral part of}} the U.S. economy. Jerome Lemelson was then able to collect over a billion dollars in license fees from large companies using bar code readers. (Note however that the Lemelson <b>optical</b> <b>recognition</b> patents followed the old 17-year rule. For patents filed 8-June-1995 or later under the TRIPS agreement, continuation patents expire 20 years from the date of filing of the parent patent application. Thus, Lemelson's [...] "submarine patents" [...] strategy is no longer possible.) ...|$|E
