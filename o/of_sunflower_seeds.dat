Feed conversion ratio negatively correlated with SGR and reflected feed intake.

The maximum percentage dye removal was obtained as 82. 12 % with 0. 4 [*]g/ 50 [*]mL adsorbent dosage at 313 [*]K. The Langmuir model showed the best fit with equilibrium isotherm data. The interactions were evaluated with respect to both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics. The adsorption process was found to follow the pseudo-second-order model. To optimize the operating conditions, the effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, and initial dye concentration were investigated by full factorial experimental design method; adsorbent dosage was found as the most significant factor with lower than 95 % confidence level.

40|$|Copyright © 1995 by American Society of Animal ScienceThe postruminal {{supply of}} the sulfur-containing amino acids, {{methionine}} and cysteine, {{has been reported to}} be a major limitation to wool growth in sheep. We aim to improve the protein quality of forage for ruminants by introducing into alfalfa chimeric genes encoding a ruminally stable, sulfur amino acid-rich protein from <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Four gene constructs were transferred to Australian commercial cultivars of alfalfa using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and selection with phosphinothricin (PPT). Modification <b>of</b> the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> albumin protein-coding region by addition of the coding information for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal was found to greatly increase the level to which the sulfur amino acid-rich protein accumulated in the leaves of transgenic alfalfa plants. The Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter and two light-regulated plant gene promoter regions were compared for their ability to direct high-level expression of the introduced genes in alfalfa leaves.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This study {{provides}} an overview <b>of</b> the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry, globally and locally. This overview is, followed by measurements of the comparative and competitive advantages of the South African and Argentinean <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industries. Two indexes are {{used to calculate the}} comparative and competitive advantages namely the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and the Relative Revealed Comparative Trade Advantage (RTA) index. The results show that South African <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> has a competitive advantage in their primary form, however the value added <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products show a competitive disadvantage which is opposite to that <b>of</b> Argentina’s <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products. The finding that South Africa is only competitive in the primary <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> market was calculated by means of trade data. Factors that affect the competitiveness <b>of</b> the <b>sunflower</b> industry were identified to indicate why value added <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> products experience a competitive disadvantage. In the analysis {{it was found that the}} South African sunflower industry is price driven. Since price plays an important role in the competitiveness of the industry, imports <b>of</b> cheaper <b>sunflower</b> crude and refined oils are considered to pose a major threat to the industry. Crushing margins has increased over the last few years due to higher sunflower oil and sunflower oilcake prices. In order to increase the competitiveness of the South African <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry, it needs to; be more cost competitive; improve quality; launch new products; invest in new technologies and improve the innovativeness. Emphasis should be placed on the value added seed products as this is where South Africa has a competitive disadvantage.

Innovation in this commodity will lead to great improvement in the competitiveness <b>of</b> the <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> industry.
