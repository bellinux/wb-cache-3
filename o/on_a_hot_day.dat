However, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day</b> where temperatures are 70°F (21°C), its vertical rate of climb is reduced to 1,595 fpm (486 m/min), and service ceiling is reduced to 19,400 feet (5,900 m) due to less dense air.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day.</b> If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E

Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption.|$|E

25|$|In 1756 {{he volunteered}} for {{military}} service with a Rhode Island regiment. Soon after, he joined Colonel Fry's Massachusetts regiment and served in Rogers' Rangers during three separate clashes with French-allied Indians. He became a prisoner after the Siege of Fort William Henry on August 9, 1757. He survived the massacre of many British prisoners by pro-French Indians that followed the surrender. The captured troops were stripped of their weapons and much of their clothing and made to march from the fort. A tomahawk-armed Native Americans seized Thayer by his under-waistcoat and began dragging him toward a swamp. The garment tore off, allowing Thayer to flee his captor. He soon joined another prisoner and the two were pursued by an Indian who tomahawked his companion to death. Thayer began sprinting and reached Fort Edward in safety.

25|$|Veeckens {{wanted to}} sold the house off again. In 1819, {{the estate of}} de Klerk was bought by Leendert Miero. Miero, born in 1755 in Grodka near Lemberg (now Lviv), arrived in Batavia in 1775 {{to work for the}} Dutch East India Company. He is {{actually}} a Polish Jew whose real name is Jehoede Leip Jegiel Igel. He hid his true identity because the Dutch East India Company prohibited the Jews from travelling to its holdings, especially its new headquarters in Batavia. In 1777, Igel was received by de Klerk in the mansion and served as a low-ranked security guard for the mansion. A story goes that <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day</b> Jehoeve fell asleep while guarding the entrance. When de Klerk unexpectedly returned, he was given 50 strokes for his laziness. On that same day, he swore that he would own the estate one day. After finishing his military service, Jehoeve changed his name to Leendert Miero and worked as a goldsmith. Despite being illiterate, he was able to make a fortune and bought the estate of Pondok Gede. Miero was able to reveal his identity when the VOC agreed to include Jews in its ranks in 1782. In the end, he bought the house of de Klerk. For the next 15 years, Miero invited big crowds to celebrate the anniversary of his lashing day, celebrated with a biblical humor. Miero married to two legal wives but he had no children. Instead, he adopted four natural children born to him by four different slaves.|$|E
25|$|Gibbs and his {{regiment}} {{fought with}} distinction under Maj. Gen. Sheridan at the Battle of Trevilian Station, June 1112, 1864, {{part of a}} diversionary operation by Sheridan against the Virginia Central Railroad during Union Lt. Gen. Grant's stealthy transfer of his forces from the lines after the Battle of Cold Harbor to {{the south side of}} the James River in an effort to take Petersburg and Richmond while they were only lightly defended. Torbert and Merritt remained in command of the 1st Division and the Reserve Brigade, respectively, during Sheridan's Trevilian Raid. The Battle of Trevilian Station was the largest all-cavalry battle of the Civil War and it resulted in a victory by Confederate cavalry under the command of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton. Confederate forces counterattacked the Reserve Brigade early on June 11, 1864 after elements of that brigade attacked advance Confederate pickets. Gibbs quickly mounted his men who left their breakfast unfinished and sent them into battle. The Confederates killed and wounded several Union troopers and took several others prisoner, including Lieutenant Colonel Thorp of the 19th New York Cavalry (1st New York Dragoons). Later, Merritt's brigade had to cut their way through Confederate resistance to free Custer's brigade, which had become surrounded. Although the Reserve Brigade cut through to Custer, Custer lost 22 per cent of his men on that day, most of them missing or captured. After eight hours of fighting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day</b> without food or drink, Gibbs was overcome by sunstroke and had to leave the field. The Union forces sustained heavy losses again on June 12, 1864 and were turned back without achieving their objectives of doing significant damage to the Virginia Central Railroad and linking up with Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter and returning with his force to the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
500|$|Becoming too hot {{is another}} hazard, and a sunny or shady {{position}} for perching can be selected {{according to the}} ambient temperature. Some species have dark patches on the wings which can provide shade for the body, and a few use the obelisk posture to avoid overheating. This behaviour involves doing a [...] "handstand", perching with the body raised and the abdomen pointing towards the sun, thus minimising the amount of solar radiation received. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day,</b> dragonflies sometimes adjust their body temperature by skimming over a water surface and briefly touching it, often three times in quick succession.

Kevin Apaza, writing for Direct Lyrics labelled the single [...] "fresh and funky", confessing that he likes it better than its predecessors [...] "1.000.000" [...] (2012) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011).

The prey usually is killed by strangulation, which can cause {{cerebral}} ischemia or asphyxia (which results in hypoxemic, or [...] "general", hypoxia). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia). Prey is typically eaten {{at the location of}} the hunt, although large prey is sometimes dragged into cover. Lions tend to squabble over a kill, particularly the males. When food is scarce, cubs tend to suffer the most but otherwise all pride members can eat their fill, including old and crippled ones which can live on leftovers. There is more sharing of larger kills. An adult lioness requires an average of about [...] of meat per day, a male about [...] A lion may gorge itself and eat up to [...] in one sitting; if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day,</b> the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard.

[...] Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> <b>day</b> may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting {{in a cool}} place. [...] Hyperthermia that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures. [...] Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have {{no role in the}} treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, {{as in the case of}} heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.|$|E
