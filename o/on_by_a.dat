5|$|As {{their journey}} continues, SpongeBob and Patrick reach a {{dangerous}} trench, but a now-banished Mindy helps them past it {{by making them}} think she can turn them into men. They are stopped by Dennis, who tries to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn stepped <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> seemingly massive hardhat diver {{they believe to be}} a Cyclops. The diver grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an {{amplifier}} and a three-cord pickup electric guitar. During {{a show in}} Helotes, Texas, Nelson {{left the}} guitar {{on the floor of}} the stage, and it was later stepped <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> drunk man.|$|E
2500|$|In logic, the {{parameters}} passed to (or operated <b>on</b> <b>by)</b> <b>an</b> open predicate are called parameters by some authors (e.g., Prawitz, [...] "Natural Deduction"; Paulson, [...] "Designing a theorem prover"). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called variables. This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision {{must be made}} to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated <b>on</b> <b>by)</b> <b>an</b> open predicate variables, and when defining substitution have to distinguish between free variables and bound variables.|$|R

5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes are preyed <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of animals, {{including}} various reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and insects. Mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured millipedes {{on the ground to}} deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes, including larval glowworm beetles, Probolomyrmex ants, chlamydephorid slugs, and predaceous dung beetles of the genera Sceliages and Deltochilum. A large subfamily of assassin bugs, the Ectrichodiinae with over 600 species, has specialized in preying upon millipedes. Parasites of millipedes include nematodes, phaeomyiid flies, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

5|$|The British {{transferred}} rule of Demerara to the Dutch in 1802 {{under the}} terms of the Peace of Amiens, but took back control of it a year later. In 1812, the British merged Demerara and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colonies were ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain on 13 August 1814. Stabroek, as the colony's capital was known under the Dutch, was renamed as Georgetown in 1812. The colonial powers appointed a governor to rule in their stead, and the local legislation was decided <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Court of Policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E

5|$|The {{shortcomings}} of Aristotelian physics {{would not be}} fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei, who {{was influenced by the}} late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> force, for example friction.|$|E
5|$|Youkilis {{signed a}} four-year, $41.25 million {{contract}} with the Red Sox on January 15, 2009. The deal also included a team option (at $14 million, with a $1.25 million buyout) for 2013. Later that year, he was voted # 36 on the Sporting News list of the 50 greatest active baseball players, voted <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> panel that included members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E

50|$|A {{post-mortem}} {{found nothing}} unusual, but rumours persisted of poison. The most likely {{cause of his}} death is heart failure, perhaps brought <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> epileptic fit. He had been known to collapse with a fit after a race in the past.|$|R
50|$|The Glass House Effect (or GHE) is the {{resulting}} phenomenon brought <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> awareness {{that one is}} subject to ubiquitous surveillance. In corporate environments, the transparency is considered a good idea, as it is believed this discourages corporate crime and other misfeasance.|$|R
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first stage of development, Diddy Kong Racing was {{conceived}} as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of Dementors {{emerge from}} the {{darkness}} while one descends and attempts to suck out the riders' souls. This effect is achieved by projecting the riders' faces onto a cloud of fog {{in front of the}} Dementor, blasting cold air towards the riders, and using a heartbeat-like sound played through the sub-woofers built into the benches. After shaking the riders out of the trance, Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus Charm. After the final Dementor, and while Harry uses his Patronus, the riders enter the final video dome segment, where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in. They fly over the Black Lake, back into Hogwarts and through the Main Hall and Grand Staircase, where they are cheered <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of onscreen characters from the movies who appear three-dimensional. Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement, where they exit their bench.|$|E

25|$|In physics, angular {{momentum}} (rarely, {{moment of momentum}} or rotational momentum) is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. It is an important quantity in physics {{because it is a}} conserved quantity – the total {{angular momentum}} of a system remains constant unless acted <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> external torque.|$|R
