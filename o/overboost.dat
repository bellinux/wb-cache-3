25|$|A {{wastegate}} {{regulates the}} {{exhaust gas flow}} that enters the exhaust-side driving turbine and therefore the air intake into the manifold {{and the degree of}} boosting. It can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted, generally vacuum hose attachment point diaphragm (for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system) to force the spring-loaded diaphragm to stay closed until the <b>overboost</b> point is sensed by the ecu or a solenoid operated by the engine’s electronic control unit or a boost controller, but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring-loaded diaphragm that can alone be pushed open, thus limiting <b>overboost</b> ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the wastegate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 the K-Jetronic {{system was}} {{replaced}} with a Lotus/Delco multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system. The engine also received an air-water-air intercooler called a Chargecooler by Lotus. This revised engine {{was known as the}} Type 910S. Power was up to [...] with [...] available on <b>overboost.</b> 0-60mph times dropped to 4.7 seconds and top speed was over [...] The 910S engine went into the new Special Equipment (SE) model, which also received changes to the body, with side skirts parallel to the body, five air ducts in the front air dam, wing mirrors from the Citroën CX and the addition of a rear wing.|$|E
50|$|Throttle valves in the updraft {{carburettor}} throat {{were controlled}} by an automatic boost control through the throttle linkage {{to maintain the}} selected manifold pressure with changes in altitude. The valves were only partially open during ground and low-level operation to prevent <b>overboosting</b> of the engine. As air density decreases with increased altitude, the throttle valves were progressively opened {{in response to the}} reducing atmospheric pressure. This system provided full power within engine boost limitations up to the critical altitude of 26000 ft.|$|R
50|$|A {{supercharger}} {{optimized for}} high altitudes causes the opposite {{problem on the}} intake side of the system. With the throttle retarded to avoid <b>overboosting,</b> air temperature in the carburetor can drop low enough to cause ice to form at the throttle plate. In this manner, enough ice could accumulate to cause engine failure, even with the engine operating at full rated power. For this reason, many supercharged aircraft featured a carburetor air temperature gauge or warning light to alert the pilot of possible icing conditions.|$|R
50|$|Its engines <b>overboosted</b> and unflyable, Z7513 was {{abandoned}} where it lay. After an Axis air raid on Kufra on 25 September 1942, it was cannibalised for spare parts {{to repair a}} Bisley damaged in the raid. In February 1959, a geological survey party rediscovered Z7513, and the bodies of its three crewmen were exhumed and reburied in Knightsbridge War Cemetery at Acroma, Libya. When de Wet's nephew visited the site again in November 2001, Z7513 {{was found to have}} been destroyed by scavenging, with its engines, propellers, and undercarriage missing.|$|R
2500|$|In the 2013 International Engine of the Year Awards {{which took}} place on 5 June 2013, Mini won an award for its 1.6 liter four-cylinder TwinPower Turbo from the Mini Cooper S {{for the third time}} in a row in the {{category}} of 1.4 to 1.8 liter engines. The engine has [...] "twin-scroll turbocharging with an <b>overboost</b> function, direct petrol injection and valve control based on the Valvetronic system" [...] and has an output of 135kW/184hp and provides enough power for the Mini Cooper S to accelerate from 0-100 in 7.0 seconds and in 2013 is available for Mini Cooper S Countryman and Mini Cooper S Paceman and an ALL-4 transmission can also be added to the configuration.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{turbocharged}} aircraft climbs, {{however, the}} pilot (or automated system) can close the wastegate, forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine, thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb, {{at least until}} the critical pressure altitude is reached (when the wastegate is fully closed), after which manifold pressure falls. With such systems, modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet (above which, RVSM certification would be required), where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds. This allows flying [...] "above the weather". In manually controlled wastegate systems, the pilot must take care not to <b>overboost</b> the engine, which causes detonation, leading to engine damage.|$|E
5000|$|The sDrive35is {{model was}} fitted with an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} N54 engine, which was later also used in the E82 1 Series M Coupe. This engine produces [...] and includes a computer-controlled <b>overboost</b> function for the 3rd to 7th gears. The boost function activates after every gear change with full throttle, and lasts for 7 seconds between 1500 and 4500rpm. Peak torque during <b>overboost</b> is 500 Nm, compared with 450 Nm without <b>overboost.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} basic {{properties}} and kinematics of two gas-rich dwarf galaxies: KK 246 and Holmberg II (HoII). HoII is 20 times more luminous in the blue-band than KK 246 and its HI mass {{is a factor}} of 6 higher than in KK 246. However, the amplitudes of the rotation curves (at the last measured point) of both galaxies are very similar, of about 40 km/s at a galactocentric radius of 7 kpc. This fact is challenging for modified theories of gravity that predict a one-to-one relation between gravity at any radius and the enclosed baryonic mass in galaxies. In particular, MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predicts an asymptotic flat velocity of 60 km/s in HoII. Since the baryonic mass of HoII {{is dominated by the}} gas component, MOND <b>overboosts</b> its rotation speed even if the mass of the stellar disk is taken negligibly small. We conclude the rotation curve of HoII is probably inconsistent with MOND, unless the inclination and distance are both fine-tuned to very unlikely values. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
50|$|A {{supercharger}} compresses the air back to sea-level-equivalent pressures, or even much higher, {{in order}} to make the engine produce just as much power at cruise altitude as it does at sea level. With the reduced aerodynamic drag at high altitude and the engine still producing rated power, a supercharged airplane can fly much faster at altitude than a naturally aspirated one. The pilot controls the output of the supercharger with the throttle and indirectly via the propeller governor control. Since the size of the supercharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the supercharger is oversized for low altitude. The pilot must be careful with the throttle and watch the manifold pressure gauge to avoid <b>overboosting</b> at low altitude. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the pilot must continuously open the throttle in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the throttle reaches full open and the engine is still producing full rated power is known as the critical altitude. Above the critical altitude, engine power output will start to drop as the aircraft continues to climb.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} efficiencies {{of various}} engine-propeller combinations were {{the subject of}} a study that covered the important flight conditions, particularly the take-off. Design charts that graphically correlate the various propeller parameters were prepared to facilitate the solution of problems and also to c 1 arify the conception of the relationships of the various engine-propeller design factors. It is shown that, among the many methods for improving the take-off thrust, the use of high-pitch, large-diameter controllable propellers turning at low rotational speeds is probably the most generally promising. With such a combination the take-off thrust may be further increased, at the expense of a small loss in cruising efficiency, by compromise designs wherein the pitch setting is slightly reduced and the diameter is further increased. The degree of compromise necessary to accomplish the maximum possible take-off improvement depends on such design factors as overspeeding and <b>overboosting</b> at take-off as well as depending on the design altitude. Both overspeeding and designing for altitude operation have the same effect on the take-off thrust as compromising in that the propulsive efficiency is increased thereby; boosting the engine, however, has the reverse effect on the propulsive efficiency, although the brake horsepower is increased...|$|R
