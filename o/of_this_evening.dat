5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is no need, Phil. I'm in the dust. This has spoiled {{everything}} backwards. I {{can never}} think of Redmond days without recalling the humiliation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Roy despises me--and you despise me--and I despise myself." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Leicester {{seemed to}} approve <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>even</b> more. He hoped {{he might have}} {{the good fortune to}} be at Chesney Wold when Mr. Skimpole next came down into Lincolnshire. Mr. Skimpole professed himself much flattered and honoured.|$|R

50|$|The book {{then comes}} back to the present day where we learn that Druss has fallen in combat in the defense of Dros Delnoch. Ulric/Talisman is saddened to learn <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> though they were on {{opposing}} sides he considered Druss a great warrior.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{is changed}} since the news I told you <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> We must {{separate}} at once, and keep apart. Remember you have only five days. If you remain in America longer than that, your life is not safe.|$|E
6000|$|GERALD. That {{suggestion}} doesn't interest me, Anabel. Ah, well, {{we shall}} see what {{we shall see}}.

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so," [...] said Lodloe, laughing. [...] "The greater part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> was {{occupied}} {{in a discussion}} on your life, adventures, moral character, disposition, and mental bias. There {{may have been some}} other points touched upon, but I don't recall them just now." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mr. Parmer, gave an {{interesting}} account {{to his friends}} at Old Washington in 1836 of his escape from San Antonio. He was a wonderfully fascinating talker and his recital <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>even</b> greatly amused those who heard him. He was a man absolutely without fear and held the Mexicans in contempt.|$|R

6000|$|... "By the Virgin!" [...] cried Manny wildly, as {{he jumped}} from his horse, [...] "I would give my last gold piece {{that the work}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> should be undone! How came it? What does it mean? Hither, my Lord Bishop, for surely it smacks of {{witchcraft}} and the Devil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll be {{off before}} daybreak, and I had {{not a chance}} earlier. I would not have missed a minute <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> for {{promotion}} to-morrow. Of course, I'll pay for it later; but that's the usual rule, and partly why I'm serving the nation as Trooper Cotton now," [...] he said, with a mirthless smile.|$|E
60|$|I {{believe that}} Mr. Arthur Morrison is a {{connection}} of yours, and I am venturing to introduce myself {{to you as a}} friend of his. Could you spare me half-an-hour of your company after the performance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening?</b> If you could honor me so much, you might perhaps allow me to give you some supper.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were taken}} home {{again in the}} fly, {{returning}} without the escort of Mr. Thompson, and as they went some few words were spoken by Mrs. Crawley.

60|$|It was {{perfectly}} obvious--he was aware <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>even</b> {{in the novel}} excitement of the chase--that a chappie couldn't hoof it at twenty-five miles an hour indefinitely along a main thoroughfare of a great city without exciting remark.

Some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>even</b> found its way into Govinda Dikshita's Sangitasudha (nidhi), authored in the early seventeenth century.|$|R
60|$|SIR,--Allow me {{to correct}} a {{statement}} put forward in your issue <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> {{to the effect that}} I have made a certain alteration in my play in consequence of the criticism of some journalists who write very recklessly and very foolishly in the papers about dramatic art. This statement is entirely untrue and grossly ridiculous.|$|E
60|$|SIR,--In your issue <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> you {{publish a}} letter from 'A London Editor' which clearly insinuates in the last {{paragraph}} that I have in some way sanctioned the circulation of an expression of opinion, {{on the part of}} the proprietors of Lippincott's Magazine, of the literary and artistic value of my story of The Picture of Dorian Gray.|$|E
60|$|The events <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> {{were not}} very remarkable. The party, like other musical parties, comprehended {{a great many people}} who had real taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all; and the {{performers}} themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation, and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in England.|$|E

6000|$|... 29. Before {{proceeding}} {{to the principal}} subject <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> I wish to anticipate one or two objections which may arise in your minds to what I must lay before you. It may perhaps have been felt by you last evening, that some things I proposed to you were either romantic or Utopian. Let us think {{for a few moments}} what romance and Utopianism mean.|$|E
60|$|The {{quietness}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> circle, {{the charm}} of its kind hospitality, the evident air of sincerity and good will which pervaded every thing, made the evening pass most delightfully to me. I had never felt myself more at home even among the Quakers. Such a visit is a true rest and refreshment, a thousand times better than the most brilliant and glittering entertainment.|$|E
6000|$|BRODIE. Business or none, little sister! I'll make time, I promise you; and there's another kiss for surety. Come along. (They {{proceed to}} push out the chair, L.C.)
