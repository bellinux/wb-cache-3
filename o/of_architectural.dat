5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field <b>of</b> <b>architectural</b> management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part <b>of</b> <b>architectural</b> practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management <b>of</b> <b>architectural</b> design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{introduces}} a reflective {{perspective on the}} role <b>of</b> computing in <b>architectural</b> design over the previous generations of computer aided design. Paradigms of the design process and computational models of designing are discussed. The evolution <b>of</b> computer aided <b>architectural</b> design is investigated. Both deadly sins and arguable virtues <b>of</b> computing in <b>architectural</b> design and their implications are reviewed. Based on addressing recent emerged developments <b>of</b> computer aided <b>architectural</b> design (CAAD), this paper {{introduces a}}n approach for the new generations of CAAD {{that has the potential}} to provide a better CAAD future for architectural researchers, educators and professionals. This approach envisages that in the new generations <b>of</b> CAAD <b>architectural</b> designing will be carried out collaboratively and synchronously within smart and real-time 3 D virtual environments within which architects are designing with intelligent agents based on the view <b>of</b> situated digital <b>architectural</b> design...|$|R
