5|$|The colonial {{impact on}} the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often {{effected}} by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with {{the traditions of the}} Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures <b>of</b> <b>decision-making.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rule {{evolved from}} the {{principle}} of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions <b>of</b> <b>decision-making</b> in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Each deputy to a Sejm was elected at a sejmik (the local sejm for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm. Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (even if only one sejmik) was considered {{a violation of the}} principle of political equality.|$|E

5|$|The {{leader and}} cabinet model <b>of</b> <b>decision-making,</b> {{adopted by the}} city council under the Local Government Act 2000, is similar to {{national}} government. The council appoints the Leader (usually {{a member of the}} group with the political majority) and he or she appoints up to nine other councillors to serve on the cabinet. The cabinet members, one of whom is appointed Deputy Leader, assume responsibility for different key areas of local governance. The full council meets around ten times a year. There are decisions that only full council can make, these include setting budgets and spending programmes, setting council tax levels and approving major policies and priorities. In addition to the Leader of the Council, the council also appoints the Mayor of Peterborough, the Deputy Mayor, committee chairmen and the chief executive. The cabinet and committees report to, and are accountable to, council.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} <b>of</b> <b>decision-making</b> ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which {{increase the risk of}} a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E

5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken.

5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure <b>of</b> <b>decision-making</b> in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E

From the proposed method in the ‘Application of parametric generalized exponential measure of fuzzy divergence in strategic decision making’ section, {{it is clear that}} a firm will achieve its goal most effectively if the strategy S 4 is applied with an input alternative I 2. Thus, I 2 is best input alternative for a firm to achieve its goal. However, we above examine from the existing methods that I 3 is the most preferable input alternative. It is also noticed that the proposed method is a very short, simple, and consistent method than the existing methods <b>of</b> strategic <b>decision-making</b> having a computational procedure involving a number of steps.

40|$|AbstractThe {{limitations}} of the classical or traditional paradigm of decision research are increasingly apparent, even though {{there has been a}} substantial body of empirical research on medical decision-making over the past 40 years. As decision-support technology continues to proliferate in medical settings, it is imperative that “basic science” decision research develop a broader-based and more valid foundation for the study <b>of</b> medical <b>decision-making</b> as it occurs in the natural setting. This paper critically reviews both traditional and recent approaches to medical decision making, considering the integration <b>of</b> problem-solving and <b>decision-making</b> research paradigms, the role of conceptual knowledge in decision-making, and the emerging paradigm <b>of</b> naturalistic <b>decision-making.</b> We also provide an examination <b>of</b> technology-mediated <b>decision-making.</b> Expanding the scope of decision research will better enable us to understand optimal decision processes, suitable coping mechanisms under suboptimal conditions, the development <b>of</b> expertise in <b>decision-making,</b> and ways in which decision-support technology can successfully mediate decision processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Article {{is to examine the}} {{concerns}} that surround situated judging and the central questions to which they give rise: How can a situated judge render a just decision? On its face, the question appears to be both decisive and unanswerable. Upon deeper examination, however, we can see that the question relies upon a doubtful set of presuppositions about situated decision-making. In the course of this Article, the author seeks to defend the pragmatic analysis <b>of</b> legal <b>decision-making</b> by casting doubt upon these assumptions. Part II develops two contrasting models <b>of</b> normative <b>decision-making</b> that represent the purported distinction between situated and nonsituated decision-making. In Part III, the author argues that these two models do not represent two alternative decision-making procedures. Instead, the author suggests that they describe two interdependent and indispensable parts <b>of</b> any <b>decision-making</b> process. Finally, the author concludes that the pragmatic espousal <b>of</b> situated <b>decision-making</b> can be understood, not as a rejection <b>of</b> rationally structured <b>decision-making</b> procedures, but rather as an elucidation and appreciation of the contextual elements of all forms of deliberation...|$|R
