5|$|The {{background}} vocals are {{an important}} part of the picture for me. That's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks.

And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E

5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> opinions, which has since developed, and I began to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Private Idaho {{came from}} John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, which {{featured}} characters who were street hustlers {{who did not}} admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay {{was written in the}} 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become My Own Private Idaho. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> childhood and youth.|$|E
