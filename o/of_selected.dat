This study is conducted by using an explanatory approach. Four hypotheses that are formulated from the goals of study will be proved in this study. Furthermore, the data analysis method that is used in this study is an inferential statistical analysis Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA). The conclusion of this study are firstly political distribution variable has influence on the decision <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> the candidate; secondly political distribution variable has not a significant influence on the decision <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> political party; thirdly the variable on the decision <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> candidate has influence the variable on the decision <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> political party; and fourthly the variable on the decision <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> candidate has mediated the variable of political distribution to the decision <b>of</b> <b>selecting</b> political party...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form <b>of</b> <b>selected</b> polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
