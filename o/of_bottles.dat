40|$|Intelligent {{empty bottle}} {{inspection}} system {{is an important}} inspection equipment <b>of</b> empty <b>bottle</b> before filling beer, {{and it is a}} blend of machine vision, precision machine and real-time control. They need to cooperate perfectly to achieve the desired effect. In the design <b>of</b> the empty <b>bottle</b> inspection system, one of the key technologies is the bottle bottom detection which affects the speed and accuracy of the system. It includes positioning and defect recognition <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom. For the problems such as the slow detection speed and low detection precision <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom detection, some new methods are proposed in this paper. The positioning algorithm <b>of</b> the <b>bottle</b> bottom in images is studied after preprocessing the obtained images, and the accurate positioning is achieved by improving the Randomized Hough transform. In the defect recognition <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom, a method of calculating optimum radius in Fourier spectrum is used {{to solve the problem of}} the detection accuracy being influenced by the antiskid veins <b>of</b> <b>bottle</b> bottom. It can improve the recognition accuracy effectively. Experiments show the methods proposed in this paper can effectively improve the precision and speed <b>of</b> the <b>bottle</b> bottom detection...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} meet recyclers' needs while {{providing}} manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a coding system was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the Society of the Plastics Industry.

25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside.

25|$|When Bushwick was founded, it was {{primarily}} an area for farming food and tobacco. As Brooklyn and New York City grew, factories that manufactured sugar, oil, and chemicals were built. The inventor Peter Cooper built a glue manufacturing plant, his first factory, in Bushwick. Immigrants from western Europe joined the original Dutch settlers. The Bushwick Chemical Works, at Metropolitan Avenue and Grand Street on the English Kills channel, was another early industry among the lime, plaster, and brick works, coal yards, and other factories that developed along English Kills, which was dredged {{and made an}} important commercial waterway. In October 1867, the American Institute awarded Bushwick Chemical Works the first premium for commercial acids of the greatest purity and strength. The Bushwick Glass Company, later known as Brookfield Glass Company, established itself in 1869, when a local brewer sold it to James Brookfield.

25|$|Shortly {{following}} the 10 March 1917, publication Regulamento do estabelecimento hidrológico das Águas Minerais de Melgaço (on the hydrological {{condition of the}} mineral waters of Melgaço), {{there was an article}} in the Jornal de Melgaço (21 July) by Gregório Fernandes that referred to a dusty access road to the incomplete thermal spa, that was unforested. The buvette (pumping pavilion) was still unfinished and the sanitary conditions of the spa was little hygienically recommendable and was missing a washroom. By August, the management presented to the Repartição de Minas a plan to improve the thermal spa, under the authorship of engineer Couto dos Santos, that included the expansion of the Quinta do Peso lodgings, in accommodate 350 visitors, the construction of a casino, a gymnasium and hydrostatic lake served by swimming huts.

25|$|Pottery {{produced}} by the Caddoan Mississippian culture {{is some of the}} finest known in North America. It is usually found in the areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma. About 1200 CE as the Caddoan culture emerged from local woodland cultures such as Fourche Maline, a distinctive pottery tradition emerged, unmistakable because of its designs, materials and fine execution. These early pots were often grog tempered, although sometimes finely ground bone was used. Two main forms emerged that would become Caddoan pottery standards for the next 1000 years, a long slender necked bottle and a carinated form <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> and bowls. Caddo pottery is considered to be some of the finest Mississippian pottery because of its thinness, symmetry, and very smooth finish, with some of its best examples being bottle forms with extensive geometric engravings. Pieces are often dark brown and black with a glossy finish achieved by the application of a fine slip made from a mixture of sifted fine clay or paint and buffed to a high finish. The first Europeans to encounter Caddoan pottery were members of the Hernando de Soto Expedition in 1541, who described it as matching even the finest potters of their European homeland.|$|E
