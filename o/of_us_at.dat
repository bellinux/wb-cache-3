Lawrence Tracy retired immediately after Wang's court-martial on an early (15-year) retirement option. As of May 2005 Jim Wang was still serving in the USAF, but he remained at the rank of captain, having been denied promotion. Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, [...] "Jim (Wang) and all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill something {{because it had been}} ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 15, 2015, ESPN Films {{released}} another 30 for 30 documentary entitled I Hate Christian Laettner {{in which}} both Laettner and his Duke teammate and roommate Brian Davis also responded to Rose's earlier remarks. Brian Davis replied, [...] "You know, they talk all this Uncle Tom sh** and, you know, I'm like, I'm more hood and street than any mother f***** on that team. To say that about us, we knew was ridiculous. Because they all wanted to go Duke. Chris Webber visited Duke and stayed with me." [...] Laettner continued: [...] "Not all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> Duke were from the entitled families. I wasn't. Bobby Hurley wasn't. Thomas Hill wasn't. Brian Davis wasn't. The only person that was, was Grant Hill. Besides that, we were blue collar kids, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Straley and Druckmann had {{previously}} {{worked together on}} Uncharted 2, and found that they shared similar interests. During the development of The Last of Us, Straley and Druckmann often joked that their relationship was [...] "like a marriage", {{in which they have}} many differing ideas, but ultimately wish to achieve the same goal. Straley's role in developing The Last of Us was to handle gameplay. However, in the final weeks of development, Straley undertook roles from different departments that were busy with other tasks; for example, he was seen hand-arranging the texts on the game's training screens, a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual. [...] "I have never even heard of a game director doing that! That's like... an intern task," [...] Wells said. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, Straley showcased a gameplay demonstration of The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>at</b> Sony's press conference; his stance on the stage became an Internet meme, and was referred to as [...] "The Bruce". The game was released on June 14, 2013 to critical acclaim. For his work on the game, Straley and Druckmann were nominated for Best Director from The Daily Telegraph; it was ultimately awarded to Davey Wreden for his work on The Stanley Parable (2013). Straley later continued his role as game director for the downloadable expansion pack [...] (2014).|$|E
500|$|As {{of the end}} of this episode, {{the status}} of three main {{characters}} remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying [...] "we've given the audience {{no reason to believe that}} Adam can figure a way to get out of there. The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened to any <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>at</b> least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here." [...] Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to hurt people. Kring says [...] "she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the sound of that word 'hero'." [...] Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, [...] "Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes." [...] Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production.|$|E
500|$|Cathy Shipton guest starred as {{original}} character Lisa [...] "Duffy" [...] Duffin in the two-part series opener. Her guest {{return was}} announced on 24 August 2015, with Shipton commenting, [...] "I {{was surprised and}} delighted {{to be asked to}} recreate the role of 'Duffy' to launch the 30th series – especially as Paul Unwin, one of the original creators, was not only writing but also directing." [...] Shipton's permanent return to the series was announced on 7 June 2016, with Kent commenting, [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> Casualty are incredibly excited that the fabulous Cathy Shipton has agreed to bring Duffy back to the Emergency Department." [...] Duffy was confirmed to make a guest appearance in episode thirty-nine, the show's thousandth episode, before returning permanently in the following series. Mark Letheren made a guest appearance in episode four as counsellor Ben Harding, a role he has played on-off since 2007. Sarah Jayne Dunn, who appeared for five months in the previous series, made a cameo appearance in episode seven as Cal's ex-girlfriend Taylor Ashbie, before making a more prominent appearance in the red-button episode which followed the episode, entitled [...] "On Call". Guy Henry, who appears regularly in Holby City as the hospital's chief executive officer Henrik Hanssen made three guest appearances throughout the series: episode nineteen, episode thirty-four, and episode thirty-five. Henry previously appeared in several episodes in 2011. Tom Chambers made two guest appearances as his Holby City character Sam Strachan in episodes twenty-three and twenty-four, whilst Emily Carey returned in the role of Grace Beauchamp in a storyline which reunited Sam with Connie, his former partner and Grace's mother. Rosie Marcel made a guest appearance as her Holby City character Jac Naylor in episode twenty-three.|$|E

Although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed {{for the duration of}} the conflict. [...] In the debate on 15 September in the House of Commons concerning the Suspensory Bill, O'Brien made it again clear [...] "that while we are prepared to pay almost any other price for a general national settlement, there is one price which some <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>at</b> all events, will never in any possible circumstances consent to pay, and that is the dismemberment of our ancient Irish nation".
