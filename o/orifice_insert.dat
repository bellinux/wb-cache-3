40|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic {{characteristics}} of a direct-pressure sensing water hydraulic relief valve. Four hydrostatic bearings support the main valve to reduce hysteresis of static characteristics of the valve. Hence, Coulomb friction acting on the main valve is not available as damping force. A damping <b>orifice</b> is <b>inserted</b> between the main- and pilot valves to get a damping force for the main valve, while the orifice diameter affects on stability of the main valve. In addition, {{the motion of the}} pilot valve has large effects on the response of the relief valve itself. To show these influences, we compute the response to a step input of relief flowrate with the MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the design parameters affecting the stability are followings: (1) the damping orifice diameter, (2) spring stiffness for the pilot valve, and (3) volume of a chamber between the damping orifice and the pilot valve...|$|R
40|$|The direct optical {{viewing of}} an argon {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) through a {{sampling}} <b>orifice</b> <b>inserted</b> directly into the plasma has been accomplished. A copper cone with a sampling orifice {{is attached to the}} entrance slit chamber of a monochromator and inserted directly into an ICP to obtain optical spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV). With solar-blind photomultiplier tube (PMT) detection, detection limits are 50 ng mL[superscript]- 1 for the resonance lines of Br and Cl during injection into the plasma of aerosols of aqueous solutions generated by pneumatic nebulization. With ultrasonic nebulization, the detection limits improve to 8 ng mL[superscript]- 1 for Br and 15 ng mL[superscript]- 1 for Cl. Detection limits for Br and Cl {{in the form of an}} aqueous sample were superior to the best reported values in the Ar and He ICP, and in the microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MIP-AES) literature. Another significant breakthrough in the present work includes the determination of nonmetals in gases by their direct injection into the ICP by a device called a direct injection probe (DIP). This low dead volume interface (3 ̆c 40 [mu] L) is used for the introduction of gaseous samples directly into the axial channel of the ICP. Injection of a gaseous mixture of compounds containing the elements Br, Cl, S, and C results in detection limits of 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 05, and 1 ng, respectively. These detection limits are by far the best obtained for these elements in a gaseous form by ICP-AES. The extension of ICP-AES analysis to the determination of nonmetals, metalloids, and/or selected metals in aqueous and gaseous samples illustrates the value of this optical sampling approach in the VUV;Because this optical viewing system does not use any lenses, mirrors, or windows, VUV radiation can be detected down to 78. 7 nm, the wavelength corresponding to the ionization energy of Ar. This ICP-VUV-AES system can therefore be beneficially applied as a diagnostic tool in the examination of excitation mechanisms in the ICP, especially with the observation of the Ar resonance lines at 104. 8 and 106. 7 nm. ftn[superscript]†DOE Report IS-T- 1310.

40|$|Flow along a nacelle was {{investigated}} {{with and without}} an <b>orifice</b> plate <b>inserted</b> into the airstream. The flow became more uniform in transit through the orifice {{when compared with the}} upstream flow and remained more uniform immediately downstream from the orifice. No improvement was found farther downstream with or without the orifice plate. Various windmills were studied to determine their effects on the downstream flow pattern. The windmill retarded flow velocity inside the circle inscribed by the tip of free wheeling propellers (used as substitute windmills), while the main stream passed over the blades seemingly unrestricted and without showing any increase in diameter. Results show that by varying a torque, the flow across a windmill can be effectively redistributed, an effect that could be gainfully employed in situations where the main flow into a diffuser is concentrated near the center. The construction of the 1 / 24 scale model tunnel and the velocity transverses obtained on the model are discussed. The transverses indicate that the velocity distribution may be considered worse in the vertical than in the horizontal plane...|$|R
40|$|A new-generation common feeding (CF) fuel {{injection}} system without rail has been compared with the standard common rail (CR) apparatus for diesel engine passenger cars. The high-pressure pump in the CF apparatus is connected directly to the injectors, and a volume of about 2. 5 cm 3 is integrated at the pump delivery. Experimental tests on solenoid injectors {{have been carried out}} for the CF and CR apparatus at a hydraulic test rig. The dependence of the injected volumes and total injector leakages on the energizing time (ET) of the two systems has been investigated for different rail pressure levels. Furthermore, the measured injected flow-rates of the CF and CR systems have been compared for single and pilot-main injection events. In general, the injection performance of the two systems is very similar, even though the differences occur in the high-pressure transients. The dynamics of the pressure waves changes because the high-pressure hydraulic layouts of the two systems are different, and the propagation and reflection of the rarefaction waves, triggered by the injection events, occur in different ways. A previously developed one-dimensional (1 D) code for the CF high-pressure layout has been further validated by means of a comparison with the experimental data. The effects of either a calibrated orifice installed at the pump delivery or an injector-integrated Minirail on the CF performance have been investigated by means of the model. Numerical parametrical tests have also been conducted on the pump-to-injector pipe length. The additional orifices that can be installed in the high-pressure circuit of the CF are effective, provided their diameter is smaller than the diameter of any other <b>orifice</b> <b>inserted</b> in the injector. Furthermore, the presence of a Minirail within the injector has an impact on the injected flow-rates of small injections, such as pilot, pre, after, and post, and also induces a reduction in the energy stored in the pressure waves. Another relevant active damping strategy of the pressure waves for the CF involves shortening the pump-to-injector pipe as much as possible. Finally, the fluid dynamical transients within the solenoid injector have been discussed for the CF and CR systems. The numerical time distributions of the main variables within the injector are shown to be independent of the presence of the rail in the layou...|$|R
40|$|In this study, flow in an {{unpacked}} and {{a partially}} packed vessels is investigated using numerical simulations. The effects of various factors including {{the number of}} inlets and outlets, and throttling the jets by <b>inserting</b> <b>orifice</b> plates above them on the flow fields are investigated. Other factors investigated include fluid flow-rate and turbulence model. It was found that for a given number and location inlets and outlets, the injection velocity {{does not have a}} very significant impact on the flow distribution. This distribution could be improved with a careful choice of the number and location of inlets and outlets. For partially packed vessels, the packing may behave like a good distributor depending on the resistance to flow offered by the bed...|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} that ion {{thruster}} hollow cathode operation at high discharge current levels can induce reduced thruster lifetimes by causing cathode insert overheating and/or erosion of surfaces located downstream of the cathode. The erosion {{problem has been}} particularly baffling because the mechanism by which it occurs has not been understood. The experimental investigation described reveals the energies of the ions produced close to the cathode orifice can be several times the anode-to-cathode potential difference generally considered available to accelerate them. These energies (of order 50 eV) are sufficient to cause the observed erosion rates. The effects of discharge current (to 60 A), magnetic field configuration and the cathode flowrate, <b>orifice</b> diameter and <b>insert</b> design on the energies and current densities of these jet ions are examined. A model describing the mechanism by which the high energy ions could be produced when the anode-cathode potential difference is insufficient is proposed.

The female baby had two giant abdominal cysts, a single atrium and foot polydactyly. Absence of the vaginal orifice was noticed, and the hymen was broken through; the left cyst collapsed after fluid drainage. The right cyst was punctured and drained, which improved the hydronephrosis. Contrast imaging showed medium {{pouring into the}} abdominal cavity via the uterine tube; the right cyst was a 6  ×  5  cm closed cavity. Vaginal uroplania persisted even after hospital discharge.

40|$|The {{requirement}} of modern industrial society is to continuously improve {{the performance of}} manufactured products and most notably increase performance density. At the same time, this has caused the micro-electronics industry to be faced with increasingly high heat fluxes which need to be dissipated. It is expected in few years that advanced microprocessors will be dissipating heat fluxes as high as 300 W/cm 2 and require cooling to maintain device temperature below a limit that is set by reliability and material concerns. This limit varies, from 85 °C for commercial microprocessors to 125 °C for defence electronics applications. Flow boiling in micro-channels is gaining significant attention in recent years due to its capability to dissipate very high heat fluxes. The major advantage of flow boiling systems {{is the ability of}} the fluid to carry larger amounts of thermal energy through the latent heat of vaporisation. For the performance assessment and design of a micro-channel cooling device, {{it is very important to}} be able to define accurately the pressure drop and flow boiling heat transfer for a given operating condition for a particular micro-channel geometry. The present study aims to add to the knowledge of the fundamentals of two-phase flow heat transfer in a micro-channel heat sink with parallel small passages, through analysis of the effect of different fluid properties, operational conditions and channel sizes. The database includes test results for two different fluids, deionised water and refrigerant R 134 a, for a total of over 1400 data points. The experimental data was compared to several correlations from literature. An observation of the two-phase flow was conducted with and without an <b>orifice</b> (porous <b>insert)</b> positioned at the inlet of micro-channels. Visualisation confirmed the existence of the back flow, flow instability and non-uniform flow distribution among the channels (maldistribution) when the porous insert was removed. Flow patterns in the micro- channels and their evolution with increasing heat flux were observed. Keywords: Two-phase flows, micro-channel, heat transfer, pressure drop, flow pattern.

40|$|The use of multi-orifice rotary nozzles greatly {{increases}} {{the speed and}} stripping effectiveness of high pressure water blasting systems, but also greatly {{increases the}} complexity of selecting and optimizing the operating parameters. The rotational speed of the nozzle must be coupled with its transverse velocity as it passes {{across the surface of}} the substrate being stripped. The radial and angular positions of each orifice must be included in the analysis of the nozzle configuration. Orifices at the outer edge of the nozzle head move at a faster rate than the orifices located near the center. The energy transmitted to the surface from the impact force of the water stream from an outer orifice is therefore spread over a larger area than energy from an inner orifice. Utilizing a larger diameter orifice in the outer radial positions increases the total energy transmitted from the outer orifice to compensate for the wider distribution of energy. The total flow rate from the combination of all orifices must be monitored and should be kept below the pump capacity while choosing <b>orifice</b> to <b>insert</b> in each position. The energy distribution from the orifice pattern is further complicated since the rotary path of all the orifices in the nozzle head pass through the center section. All orifices contribute to the stripping in the center of the path while only the outer most orifice contributes to the stripping at the edge of the nozzle. Additional orifices contribute to the stripping from the outer edge toward the center section. With all these parameters to configure and each parameter change affecting the others, a computer model was developed to track and coordinate these parameters. The computer simulation graphically indicates the cumulative affect from each parameter selected. The result from the proper choices in parameters is a well designed, highly efficient stripping system. A poorly chosen set of parameters will cause the nozzle to strip aggressively in some areas while leaving the coating untouched in adjacent sections. The high pressure water stripping system can be set to extremely aggressive conditions allowing stripping of hard to remove adhesives, paint systems, and even cladding and chromate conversion coatings. The energy force can also be reduced to strip coatings from thin aluminum substrates without causing any damage or deterioration to the substrate's surface. High pressure water stripping of aerospace components has thus proven to be an efficient and cost effective method for cleaning and removing coatings...|$|R
40|$|The use of Er,Cr:YSGG laser to {{activate}} irrigants {{results in the}} creation of vapour bubbles and shockwaves. The present study evaluated the magnitude of pressure changes in the root canal during laser-activated irrigation. The root canal of a single extracted maxillary canine was enlarged to a size 40 / 0. 06 file. A pressure sensor was inserted apically into the root canal. The tooth was processed as follows. In the EDTA condition, the tooth was irrigated with 17 % EDTA; in the NaOCl condition, the tooth was irrigated with 3 % NaOCl. In all conditions, the irrigants were activated at 0. 75 and 1. 75 W for 60 s using RFT 2 and MZ 2 tips; to analyse the effect of tip placement, the tip was activated at the <b>orifice</b> and after <b>inserting</b> the tip 5 mm deeper than the orifice. Data showed no significant difference between irrigation regimens (p > 0. 05). There were no significant differences of the pressure between RFT 2 and MZ 2 tips (p > 0. 05). The placement of tips closer to the apex resulted in significantly higher pressure than at the orifice (p < 0. 001). The use of 1. 75 W power resulted in a significantly higher increase of pressure compared to 0. 75 W (p < 0. 001), regardless either the type of solutions or tips used. The magnitude of the pressure changes in the root canal at 0. 75 W was significantly lower than 1. 75 W regardless of either type of tips or solutions used.

To this end, a pulse detonation engine ground test demonstration rig has been developed and tested using stoichiometric propane-air mixtures. Much of this work has been invested into rig and instrumentation development as well as performing and analysing experiments. The rig has been tested using two different combustion chamber diameters, 0. 089 m and 0. 038 m, with lengths of 1 m and 1. 18 m respectively. In addition, experiments were carried out with an <b>orifice</b> filled tubular <b>insert</b> which restricted the internal diameter to 0. 032 m over a distance of 14 tube diameters. A semi-empirical model has also been developed and validated {{for use in the}} prediction of flame acceleration (FA) through circular orifice plates. This was validated for a range of obstacle blockage ratios (BR) and tube lengths. The model was found to perform well, within one order of magnitude in all cases. Where modelling predictions fell beyond one standard deviation of the experimental mean it is thought that the discrepancy is a result of insufficient purging. Experimental shock speed, pressure and flame speed have been analysed using statistical density functions for a range of orifice fractal dimensions, orifice plate BR and obstacle lengths. Of particular interest are the novel experimental results produced by varying orifice fractal dimension or BR in separate tests {{along the length of the}} obstacle.
