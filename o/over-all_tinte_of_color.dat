40|$|The TINTE {{code system}} {{deals with the}} nuclear and the thermal {{transient}} behaviour of the primary circuit of an HTGR taking into consideration the mutual feedback effects in two-dimensional r-z geometry. In Part One of this report (JÜI- 2167, Nov. 1987) the initial equations were compiled and methods of solution discussed. In an appendix to this second part they are completed by some supplementary points. The TINTE code construction and a detailed input description will be discussed inPart Three. The present Part Two shows examples of application, especially a comparrative calculation of dynamic experiments performed at the AVR. A good agreament between calculational and experimental results is found. Further examples show the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>TINTE</b> : first <b>of</b> all, individual moduli <b>of</b> <b>TINTE</b> are used {{to find a solution}} to a thermofluid problem. In addition TINTE is used to demonstrate the mutual feedback between nuclear and thermal processes in heating reactors, including those with natural convective conditions, without any control rod movement...|$|R

The Encyclopedia also delves into color as it applies to other domains such as art and design – ie – color design, color harmony, color palettes, color and accessibility, researching color deficiency, and color and data visualization.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the challenges of}} intra-race legal representation for lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> law students <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> and those teaching law students <b>of</b> <b>color</b> by analyzing how {{the dynamics of the}} lawyer’s and client’s racial sameness impact legal representation. This Article brings together three strands of lawyering theory – the role of race in lawyering, critical race theory, {{and the role of the}} lawyer in intra-race legal representation. In doing so, this Article explores a number of provocative questions: Does being the same race as their clients make lawyers better legal representatives? Should lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> embrace or resist race’s influence on intra-race legal representation? How do lawyers balance their desire to remain representative of their race with their responsibility to their clients? This Article also scrutinizes the role of the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> in intra-race legal representation by examining questions that are under-reviewed, such as: Do lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> engage in the same explicit and implicit biases against their clients <b>of</b> <b>color</b> that lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> similarly suffer? Do racial stereotypes tempt the lawyer to be more sympathetic towards, and understanding of, their same-race clients, or does it cause the lawyer to view the same-race client as an ‘other’? For lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and clients <b>of</b> <b>color</b> who seek same-race legal representation, this Article explores a difficult question— Is the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> representative enough <b>of</b> the race to be a representative for the client, particularly when the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and the client <b>of</b> <b>color</b> live in different socio-economic environments? Given the resurgent examination of the role of race in interactions between persons <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and persons <b>of</b> power, this Article presents a timely opportunity to examine and question the role of race and the impact of divergent socio-economic status in intra-race legal representation...|$|R

40|$|In the {{proposed}} paper, {{we present a}} three-dimensional interactive visualization method {{for the analysis of}} the referential aspects <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term semantics. Using rgl and geometry R packages, the method is designed to represent the distribution <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term referents as point clouds or convex hulls in a three dimensional color space such as RGB, Lab, Luv etc. (see Fig. 1) Theoretical background – the technique has been developed for the usage-based analysis of linguistic categorization and is aimed to complement the distributional methods applied in the traditional corpus studies. Corpus-based analyses <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term meanings have provided important insights into the structure <b>of</b> <b>color</b> concepts, however, they can give only indirect access to the referential aspects <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term meaning (Kerttula 2002, Steinvall 2002). Considering the essentially perceptual nature <b>of</b> <b>color</b> concepts {{and the role of the}} extralinguistic reality in their construal, the lack of referential information considerably limits the possibility of modeling the very core <b>of</b> the <b>color</b> term semantics. Furthermore, this limitation remains a major methodological obstacle for developing cognitive linguistic models <b>of</b> <b>color</b> conceptualization which would be compatible with the experimental findings <b>of</b> <b>color</b> categorization studies in psychology, anthropology, color vision, artificial intelligence, and other cognitive sciences, where the referential/perceptual aspects <b>of</b> <b>color</b> categories play a central role...|$|R
