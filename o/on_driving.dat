In Troms and Finnmark, the Reindeer Police are responsible for monitoring and supervising reindeer husbandry and environmental supervision. As of 2009 there were 301 rural police districts, 68 local police stations and 10 execution and enforcement authorities.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses <b>on</b> <b>driving</b> rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E

40|$|Parallel hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) increasing {{rapidly in the}} automobile markets. However, the benefits out of using this kind of vehicles are still concerned a lot of costumers. This work investigated the expected benefits (such as decreasing emissions and increasing fuel economy) from using the parallel HEV {{in comparison to the}} conventional vehicle model of the real-world and standard driving cycles. The software Autonomie used in this study to simulate the parallel HEV and conventional models <b>on</b> these <b>driving</b> cycles. The results show that the fuel economy (FE) can be improved significantly up to 68 % <b>on</b> real-world <b>driving</b> cycle, which is represented mostly city activities. However, the FE improvement was limited (10 %) <b>on</b> the highway <b>driving</b> cycle, and this is expected since the using of brake system was infrequent. Moreover, the emissions from parallel HEV decreased about 40 % <b>on</b> the real-world <b>driving</b> cycle, and decreased 11 % <b>on</b> the highway <b>driving</b> cycle. Finally, the engine efficiency, improved about 12 % <b>on</b> the real-world <b>driving</b> cycle, and about 7 % <b>on</b> highway <b>driving</b> cycle.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of two different energy management strategies which are the management strategy based on the dynamic system running state and the management strategy based <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> cycle. The paper focuses on the study of the strategy based <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> cycle, and points out that though the operation process of the global optimization strategy based <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> cycle takes long and large amount of calculation so that it can hardly be used in the real vehicle. The strategy can be taken as the reference for the ideal optimization control target. In order to achieve the real-time optimal control, there are mainly the method based <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> cycle of recognition control strategy and the method based on model predictive control, etc. It makes the exploration to predict the real-time optimal control strategy based <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> cycle become real, and the effects of the control results get close to the offline global optimization. The proposed strategy is a new research hotspot and research trend of energy management strategy...|$|R
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions <b>on</b> <b>driving</b> in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus <b>on</b> <b>driving</b> the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E

5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} vehicular combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses <b>on</b> <b>driving.</b> Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to toggle between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work <b>on</b> <b>driving</b> down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E

40|$|A novel type of {{integral}} {{squeeze film}} damper (ISFD) is proposed to reduce and isolate vibration excitations of the gear system through bearing to the foundation. Four ISFD designs were tested experimentally with an open first-grade spur gear system. Vibration reduction characteristics were experimentally studied at different speeds for cases where ISFD elastic damping supports were simultaneously installed <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> and driven shafts, installed on the driven shaft, or only installed <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> shaft. Experimental {{results show that the}} ISFD elastic damping support can effectively reduce shock vibration of the gear system. Additionally, resonant modulation in gear shafts caused by meshing impact was significantly reduced. Different vibration amplitudes of gear shafts with ISFD installed only <b>on</b> driven or <b>driving</b> shafts were compared. Results indicated that vibration reduction is better when ISFD is only installed on the driven shaft than <b>on</b> the <b>driving</b> shaft...|$|R
