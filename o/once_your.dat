500|$|While some reviewers {{considered}} Neverwinter Nights 2 {{superior to}} its predecessor, Neverwinter Nights, the sequel received lower overall review ratings. Implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 ruleset was praised as faithful to the pen-and-paper version, with GameDaily stating [...] "The 3.5 edition ruleset {{is in full swing}} in Neverwinter Nights 2, where critical hits can devastate your entire party." [...] The game's representation of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting was also well received. The storyline was widely considered one of the game's strong points and an improvement over Neverwinter Nights. GameSpy stated that the single–player campaign was [...] "worthy of its exhaustive pedigree", and Game Informers reviewer said [...] "This title easily trumps the original NWN’s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters". Another reviewer declared it [...] "one of the best written games in history". [...] Aaron R. Conklin of The Wisconsin State Journal said, [...] "It'd be very easy to be turned off by the first mundane chapters of the game's sprawling plot.... Stick with it: <b>Once</b> <b>your</b> party hits Neverwinter (and reaches level seven or so), the proceedings become significantly more interesting—especially in terms of character interaction and development.... NWN2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and scope." [...] Conklin and Matt Slagle of Deseret News were pleased with the ethical choices in the game, with both noting approvingly that diplomacy was a very valid option that could succeed in place of combat.|$|E
2500|$|Leaded {{glass from}} CRTs is reused in car batteries, ammunition, and lead wheel weights, or sold to {{foundries}} as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore. Copper, gold, palladium, silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling. Hazardous smoke and gases are captured, contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat. These methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials. Hewlett-Packard product recycling solutions manager Renee St. Denis describes its process as: [...] "We move them through giant shredders about 30 {{feet tall and}} it shreds everything into pieces {{about the size of}} a quarter. <b>Once</b> <b>your</b> disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big, it's hard to get the data off". An ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased cost-effective processing of bulk electronic waste. Reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device. Devices still need eventual recycling, but by allowing others to purchase used electronics, recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use.|$|E
