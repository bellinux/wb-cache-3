In 1917, the school had 244 pupils, which increased to 308 over the next 11 years, and reached 376 in 1935. In 1952, 380 boys were on the roll, which included 42 sixth form students. Under Denis Rendall, the school experienced a strong growth in numbers; in 1970, there were 463 pupils, increasing to 689 in 1978, and to 742 in 1986. At the last Ofsted inspection in 2007, The Judd School had 933 students. According to the school, as of 2010 the student body is made up of 935 students: 625 in the lower school and 310 in the sixth form, including about 60girls. Many students come from affluent backgrounds and very few require free school meals; the number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> learning difficulties and special educational needs is well below the national average.

40|$|Current {{reforms of}} teacher {{evaluation}} {{systems in the}} state of Michigan are meant to improve teacher effectiveness, resulting in increased student growth and achievement. However, little research exists to support best practices in the evaluation of special education teachers. The evaluation of special education teachers involves many unique challenges which are especially apparent when evaluating teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> lowincidence <b>disabilities.</b> The tools and processes being proposed by the state are born from research within general education and, consequently, may not be effective in meeting the unique challenges of evaluating special education teachers. The perceptions of special education administrators regarding the effectiveness of tools/systems currently being used in Michigan to evaluate teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> lowincidence <b>disabilities</b> are examined in this study. In addition, the perceptions of special education administrators regarding the importance of certain evaluation components within evaluation tools/systems to be used <b>with</b> teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> low-incidence <b>disabilities</b> are also examined. The perceived effectiveness varied across respondents. However, the perceived effectiveness of evaluation tools was higher when the tool had been modified specifically for teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> low-incidence <b>disabilities.</b> The components of evaluation rated most important by respondents were ones that were most unique to special education teachers. It is concluded that current tools/systems being used to evaluate teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> low-incidence <b>disabilities</b> need to be modified in order to be effective...|$|R
