5|$|Bumblebees are {{important}} pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, {{they do not}} stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares <b>of</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.|$|E
5|$|A {{protracted}} South Florida {{labor dispute}} between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) and growers <b>of</b> <b>tomatoes</b> in the region expanded to include Burger King and other major fast food companies, including McDonald's and Yum! Brands. In 2001, the CIW sought a pay raise for tomato pickers in the region and, starting with its Boot the Bell campaign aimed at Yum! subsidiary Taco Bell, began to target the chains with protests, letter writing campaigns, and petitions demanding that the companies purchase tomatoes only from suppliers who agree to the pay increase. The campaign, which eventually attracted the support of religious groups, labor organizations, student groups and anti-slavery activists, {{became known as the}} Campaign for Fair Food with a stated goal to increase the wages of the pickers by 1¢ per pound picked above the 45¢ paid per bucket at the time, or about 77¢ for each 32-pound (14.5kg) bucket in 2005 US dollars. In 2005, McDonald's Corporation and Yum! signed agreements acquiescing to the group's purchasing demands, although implementation was put on hold due to threats by the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange to fine its members $100,000 if they complied; however, Burger King corporate parent Burger King Brands declined to enter into a similar agreement with the group.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether intake <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> products {{reduces the risk}} of prostate cancer using a meta-analysis. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE and contacted authors to identify potential studies. Log relative risks (RRs) were weighed by the inverse of their variances to obtain a pooled estimate with its 95 % confidence interval (CI). Logistic regression and Poisson regression analyses were used to determine the effect produced by a daily intake of one serving <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> product. Results: Eleven case-control studies and 10 cohort studies or nested case-control studies presented data on the use <b>of</b> <b>tomato,</b> tomato products, or lycopene and met our inclusion criteria. Compared with nonfrequent users <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> products (1 st quartile of intake), the RR of prostate cancer among consumers of high amounts <b>of</b> raw <b>tomato</b> (5 th quintile of intake) was 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 80 – 1. 00). For high intake <b>of</b> cooked <b>tomato</b> products, this RR was 0. 81 (95 % CI 0. 71 – 0. 92). The RR of prostate cancer related to an intake of one serving/day <b>of</b> raw <b>tomato</b> (200 g) was 0. 97 (95 % CI 0. 85 – 1. 10) for the case-control studies and 0. 78 (95 % CI 0. 66 – 0. 92) for cohort studies. Conclusion: Our results show that tomato products {{may play a role in}} the prevention of prostate cancer. However, this effect is modest and restricted to high amounts <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> intake. Further research is needed to determine the type and quantity <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> products with respect to their role in preventing prostate cancer.

40|$|The {{macrostructure}} <b>of</b> the <b>tomato</b> telomeres {{has been}} investigated by in situ hybridization, genomic sequencing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In situ hybridizations with a cloned telomeric sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that the telomeric repeat <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> cross-hybridizes with that of Arabidopsis and is located at all telomeres. Bal 31 digestion kinetics confirmed that the tomato telomeric repeat represents the outermost DNA sequence <b>of</b> each <b>tomato</b> chromosome. Genomic sequencing <b>of</b> enriched <b>tomato</b> telomeric sequences, using primers derived from the Arabidopsis sequence, revealed that the consensus sequence <b>of</b> the <b>tomato</b> telomeric repeat is TT(T/A) AGGG compared with the Arabidopsis consensus sequence of TTTAGGG. Furthermore, as shown by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the telomeric repeat <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> is separated by not {{more than a few}} hundred kilobases from a previously described 162 -base pair satellite DNA repeat <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> (TGR I) at 20 of the 24 telomeres. Together, these sequences are found in the heterochromatic terminal knob observed in pachytene chromosomes. Therefore, these two repeats determine the structure of 20 <b>of</b> the 24 <b>tomato</b> chromosome ends over approximately 2 % of the total chromosome length...|$|R

25|$|Unlike other {{fruits and}} vegetables, where {{nutritional}} content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing <b>of</b> <b>tomatoes</b> increases {{the concentration of}} bioavailable lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is up to four times more bioavailable than in fresh tomatoes. The reason is that in raw plant foods, lycopene is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to vegetable fiber. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.|$|E

40|$|The {{volatile}} profiles <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> wine {{before and}} 90 days after storage at 10  and 15  were determined.

A total of 75 volatile compounds are identified, iz. 38 esters, 7 carbonyls, 1 furan, 4 sulphur-containing compounds, 18 higher alcohols, 6 fatty acids and 1 terpene. Twenty-five volatile compounds are present beyond their odour threshold, but the major contributors to the overall aroma <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> wine are ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate and isoamyl acetate, which are characterised by fruity notes.

40|$|As expected, {{noticeable}} depolymerization {{of highly}} esterified pectin (DE, 80 %) catalyzed by tomato polygalacturonase was observed when active tomato pectinmethylesterase was present, {{which was not}} the case in absence <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase. Besides, an increase in polygalacturonase activity was observed up to an optimal pressure level (100 - 20 OMPa) depending on the temperature under study. Only at higher pressures, the rate of enzymatic pectin depolymerization diminished. In presence <b>of</b> active <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase a higher tomato pectinmethylesterase activity was observed than in absence <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase at atmospheric pressure. The pectinmethylesterase catalyzed pectin deesterification accelerates by increasing pressure up to 200 MPa in presence <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase. Higher pressures diminished the tomato pectinmethylesterase activity becoming even lower as compared to atmospheric pressure, which is in contrast with the pectinmethylesterase activity studies performed in absence <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase. In general, tomato polygalacturonase activity was influenced indirectly by the presence <b>of</b> active <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase and vice versa during thermal and high-pressure treatment. The combination of 40 degrees C and 400 MPa represents an optimal condition to preserve or improve theological properties <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> based products, because at this condition tomato polygalacturonase activity is reduced while pectinmethylesterase activity is maintained.

25|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} that {{are high in}} lycopene include autumn olive, gac, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, seabuckthorn, wolfberry (goji, a berry relative of tomato), and rosehip. Ketchup is a common dietary source of lycopene. Although gac (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng) has the highest content of lycopene of any known fruit or vegetable (multiple times more than tomatoes), tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices, and ketchup {{account for more than}} 85% of the dietary intake of lycopene for most people.

Campania produces over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production <b>of</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point, however, for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares.
