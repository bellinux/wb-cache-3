Roosevelt during the Progressive and New Deal eras. They had since been hidden under layers <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> paint. Under his administration, CPS appointed an Arts Education Task Force and a Bureau of Cultural Arts.|$|E
5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final look at his family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E
5|$|Himeji Castle is {{the largest}} and most visited castle in Japan, and it was {{registered}} in 1993 {{as one of the first}} UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. The area within the middle moat of the castle complex is a designated Special Historic Site and five structures of the castle are also designated National Treasures. Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan's three premier castles. In order to preserve the castle buildings, it underwent restoration work for several years and reopened to the public on March 27, 2015. The works also removed decades <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> grime, restoring the formerly grey roof to its original brilliant white color.|$|E

They have no teeth, and break down their food by grinding it between the bottoms of their mouths and their tongues.

25|$|Seawalls, causeways {{and a short}} railway {{were built}} across the swampy tidal flats. To finish these projects, the Filipinos had to remove {{thousands}} of tons <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> rock from Kalalake in Olongapo to use as fill. The magnitude of this quarrying was so huge that a hill eventually disappeared and became a lagoon in the area now known as Bicentennial Park.|$|E
25|$|Founded in 1870 by Sylvester Johnson and Jacob Julian, Irvington was {{originally}} {{created as a}} suburban town of Indianapolis. It formed along winding roads <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> brick that reflected landscape design in the Romantic era. The town was built as a quiet suburb where artists, politicians, military generals, academics, and heads of local industry resided. In 1902 Irvington was annexed by Indianapolis.|$|E

25|$|A {{more likely}} {{explanation}} is that the keys were dropped by one of the limeburners shortly before being found, as the layer <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> shells they were found below was dated as around 2300–2800 years old, making La Trobe's dating implausible. According to geologist Edmund Gill, and engineer and historian Peter Alsop, the error by La Trobe is quite understandable, given that in 1847 most Europeans thought the world was only 6000 years old.|$|E
25|$|The Museum {{became a}} {{construction}} site as Sir Robert Smirke's grand neo-classical building gradually arose. The King's Library, {{on the ground floor}} of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during The Great Exhibition of 1851. In spite <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.|$|E
25|$|The Robotic Arm (RA) is {{designed}} to extend 2.35 m from its base on the lander, and {{has the ability to}} dig down to 0.5 m below the surface. It took samples <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> ice that were analyzed by other instruments on the lander. The arm was designed and built for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by Alliance Spacesystems, LLC (now MDA US Systems, LLC) in Pasadena, California. A rotating rasp-tool located in the heel of the scoop was used to cut into the strong permafrost. Cuttings from the Rasp were ejected into the heel of the scoop and transferred to the front for delivery to the instruments. The Rasp tool, also called the Icy Soils Acquisition Device (ISAD), was conceived of at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The flight version of the Rasp was designed and built by HoneyBee Robotics in Manhattan NY. Commands were sent for the arm to be deployed on May 28, 2008, beginning with the pushing aside of a protective covering intended to serve as a redundant precaution against potential contamination of Martian subsoil by Earthly life-forms.|$|E

500|$|From the 4th century onwards, the aqueduct's {{maintenance}} was neglected as successive {{waves of}} invaders disrupted the region.

The resulting deposits in the conduit, consisting of layers <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> organic material, are up to [...] thick on each wall. An analysis of the deposits originally suggested that it had continued to supply water to Nîmes until as late as the 9th century, but more recent investigations suggest that it had gone out of use by about the sixth century, though parts of it may have continued to be used for significantly longer.|$|E

The strolls out to these old forts are seedily picturesque.

The excavation of [...] <b>of</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>and</b> rock had to be accomplished before the new [...] long section of dam was built. The addition made the original [...] dam almost a mile long. Original designs for the powerhouse had twelve smaller units but were altered to incorporate six of the largest generators available.

[...] The first new generator was commissioned in 1975 and the final one in 1980. The three 700MW units were later upgraded to 805MW by Siemens.|$|E
