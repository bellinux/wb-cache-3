5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the <b>objective</b> sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative <b>objective,</b> but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative <b>objective</b> notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

Robert Mager’s little text, Preparing Instructional <b>Objectives,</b> first printed in 1962, {{assisted}} many instructors in formulating and writing <b>objectives.</b> Since then, the use of <b>objectives</b> has become commonplace in education. The National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) also affirms the value of <b>objectives.</b> Specifically, Essentials 12 and 13 address the importance of incorporating <b>objectives</b> within the curriculum and specific units of study. The purpose of this unit is to assist the educator in writing <b>objectives</b> using a standard protocol. <b>Objectives</b> are not difficult to write if one follows the guidelines noted below. Instructional <b>objectives</b> are written for the student and they state what the student is expected to do following instruction. <b>Objectives</b> are specific, observable, and measurable learning outcomes. In contrast, goals are general and non-specific. Goals are appropriate for an entire course or a curriculum of study, while <b>objectives</b> are written for individual units of study. There are benefits to incorporating <b>objectives</b> within our coursework. <b>Objectives</b> emphasize major points and reduce non-essential material. <b>Objectives</b> simplify note taking and cue the students to emphasize major points. <b>Objectives</b> assist students in organizing and studyin...|$|R

30|$|The set of <b>objectives</b> {{that were}} best met were the {{strategic}} project <b>objectives.</b> This {{is hardly surprising}} as these are the <b>objectives</b> that have the most direct relevance to the project. A surprising finding, based on the matrix evaluations, {{was that in the}} fields of Sustainable Development and Community and Public Policies, both FP 5 and FP 6 projects were considered to have contributed more to higher-level WP <b>objectives</b> than the lower-level KA or PS <b>objectives,</b> which could be considered more directly applicable to the projects commissioned. One explanation could be that the higher level <b>objectives</b> are more general and thus easier to meet than the lower level <b>objectives</b> that are more specific. Also, when a project meets its specific <b>objectives</b> satisfactorily, but not the European policy <b>objectives,</b> it might be because the project is focused on one single goal only and thus has been evaluated low for the wider <b>objectives.</b> In the field of SuD only 20 %, and in the field of CPP 50 %, of the projects reviewed met their strategic project <b>objectives</b> and the relevant KA (or equivalent) <b>objectives</b> that they were commissioned under, as well as {{one or more of the}} relevant WP <b>objectives.</b> This suggests that there could be considerable discrepancies between the SuD and CPP components of different levels of <b>objectives</b> set.|$|R
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that morality is the <b>objective</b> law of reason: just as <b>objective</b> physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), <b>objective</b> rational laws necessitate rational actions. He thus {{believed that}} a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly rational (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with <b>objective</b> rational laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the <b>objective</b> law of reason is a priori, existing externally from rational being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, rational laws (morality) exist prior to rational beings. Therefore, according to Kant, rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study of three {{laboratory}} exercises in biology, chemistry and physics is to show how secondary school science teachers' <b>objectives</b> for labwork are carried out in practice. What <b>objectives</b> do teachers put forward for specific laboratory exercises, what <b>objectives</b> appear in supporting laboratory manuals and how do <b>objectives</b> appear in teacher and student interactions during laboratory work? In three cases, pre-interviews with teachers about their <b>objectives</b> took place, laboratory instruction manuals were collected, video recordings of the actual laboratory exercises were made and post-interviews with teachers about these video-recordings took place. The teachers' expressed <b>objectives</b> and <b>objectives</b> identified in manuals were compared with <b>objectives</b> identified in teacher actions and teacher-student interactions. The {{results show that the}} introduction of the laboratory exercise and its laboratory manual is very important.

5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's discretionary powers under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an <b>objective</b> test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the <b>objective</b> test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the <b>objective</b> test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the <b>objective</b> test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the <b>objective</b> test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E
