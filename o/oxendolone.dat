50|$|<b>Oxendolone</b> (INN, USAN, JAN) (brand names Prostetin, Roxenone; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} TSAA-291), {{also known as}} 16β-ethyl-19-nortestosterone or 16β-ethylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal antiandrogen and progestin of the 19-nortestosterone group that has been marketed in Japan by Takeda {{for the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) since 1981. It binds to the androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 320 nM) and progesterone receptor (Ki = 20 nM) and acts as a weak but clinically relevant inhibitor of 5α-reductase (IC50 = 1.4 μM). The binding affinity of <b>oxendolone</b> for the AR is far lower than that of cyproterone acetate. At the AR, <b>oxendolone</b> is not a silent antagonist but is rather predominantly antagonistic with weak agonistic activity; for this reason, it {{has been described as a}} selective androgen receptor modulator. The drug has antigonadotropic properties via its progestogenic actions. Although <b>oxendolone</b> is approved for the treatment of BPH in Japan, concerns have been raised about its use for this condition due to poor efficacy seen in clinical trials.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oxendolone</b> (Prostetin, Roxenone): A {{combined}} AR antagonist and progestogen/antigonadotropin. Marketed in Japan {{only for}} the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Controversial due to low effectiveness observed in clinical studies.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their progestogenic activity, some progestins are antagonists of the androgen receptor {{and can be used}} therapeutically as antiandrogens. These progestins, with varying degrees of potency as antiandrogens, include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, megestrol acetate, nomegestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and <b>oxendolone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Antigonadotropins: {{drugs that}} {{suppress}} the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production. Examples include GnRH analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix, progestogens like chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and <b>oxendolone,</b> and estrogens like estradiol, estradiol esters, ethinylestradiol, conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin), diethylstilbestrol, and bifluranol.|$|E

50|$|The 5α-reductase inhibitors {{finasteride}} and dutasteride {{are used}} to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, {{a condition in which}} the prostate becomes enlarged and this results in urinary obstruction and discomfort. They are effective because androgens act as growth factors in the prostate gland. The functional antiandrogens <b>oxendolone</b> and gestonorone caproate are also approved in some countries for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
50|$|Examples of GnRH {{agonists}} include leuprorelin (leuprolide) and goserelin, {{while an}} example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and bifluranol. Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and <b>oxendolone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Androgen {{receptor}} antagonists: {{drugs that}} bind directly to and block the AR. These drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, chlormadinone acetate, spironolactone, <b>oxendolone,</b> and osaterone acetate (veterinary) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, topilutamide, and enzalutamide. Aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate, {{a few other}} progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal HRT including dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, and nomegestrol acetate also have varying degrees of AR antagonistic activity.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and <b>oxendolone</b> are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
40|$|Forty-three {{patients}} with {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} were treated with weekly i. m. injections of 400 mg <b>oxendolone</b> for 12 weeks. The subjective symptoms were improved in 83 % of these patients. Residual urine was decreased significantly and Qmax was increased by this treatment. Serum VLDL level was suppressed significantly, whereas the levels of LDL, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were changed little. Atherosclerotic index and the ratio of (total cholesterol [...] HDL-cholesterol) to (HDL-cholesterol), was not influenced by the treatment. No severe side-effect was found. These findings suggest that <b>oxendolone</b> is the drug of choice for non-surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia...|$|E
