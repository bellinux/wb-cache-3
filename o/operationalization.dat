25|$|An {{operational}} definition is {{the application of}} <b>operationalization</b> used in defining {{the terms of a}} process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (e.g. a variable, term, or object) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, chemical composition, etc. Since the degree of <b>operationalization</b> can vary itself, it can result in a more or less {{operational definition}}. The procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least by peers.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} that more or fewer categories of <b>operationalizations</b> exist. Thus, researchers {{should be encouraged to}} continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, & Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant <b>operationalizations,</b> the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of <b>operationalizations</b> might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted—a task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument.|$|R

30|$|Given the {{background}} of past research, this paper aims to evaluate the comparability of task measures in the German data and to explore in how far results on task change in Germany are robust to variable choice. We hypothesize that findings depend on the measures specified. To test our hypothesis, we apply different strategies to classify tasks into task domains, and we subsequently analyze how results on task change for these different <b>operationalizations</b> compare. Our results demonstrate that different <b>operationalizations</b> lead to different conclusions about task change in Germany.|$|R
25|$|The trait EI {{model is}} general and subsumes the Goleman model {{discussed}} above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait {{leads to a}} construct that lies outside the taxonomy of human cognitive ability.

25|$|Similar to the {{g factor}} (g) for general {{individual}} intelligence, a new scientific understanding of collective intelligence aims to extract a general collective intelligence factor c factor for groups indicating a group's {{ability to perform}} {{a wide range of}} tasks. Definition, <b>operationalization</b> and statistical methods are derived from g. Similarly as g is highly interrelated with the concept of IQ, this measurement of collective intelligence can be interpreted as intelligence quotient for groups (Group-IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se. Causes for c and predictive validity are investigated as well.|$|E
25|$|Quantitative {{psychological}} research {{lends itself}} to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. The measurement and <b>operationalization</b> of important constructs {{is an essential part}} of these research designs.|$|E

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. We start by briefly reviewing {{the literature on}} the task approach, focusing on how the relevant task domains are determined and how they are measured. The third section focuses on the data. We give an overview of our methodologies and describe the general content of the data with a particular emphasis on task items. In the fourth section, we apply three different strategies of <b>operationalizations</b> to our data. The fifth section compares the three <b>operationalizations</b> and explores in how far results depend on the measures specified. In the last section, we summarize our recommendations for applying the task approach to German data.|$|R
30|$|This section {{compares the}} three <b>operationalizations</b> through a {{sensitivity}} analysis. We elaborate on whether all three lead to similar conclusions on task change in Germany {{or whether the}} results depend on the task measures used in the analysis.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{statistical}} evidence Admiral King stripped the Atlantic Fleet {{to fill the}} gaps in the Pacific nor is the evidence the US Navy had neglected the preparation for anti-submarine warfare or ignored the learning from WWI, the Neutrality Patrols or the early Battle of the Atlantic. The attack on Pearl Harbor caught the US Navy {{in the early stages}} of <b>operationalization.</b> One can praise the US Navy for its ability to implement convoys so quickly with a bevy of essentially “green” crews, new vessels and new aircraft coming “on line.” If the war had started six months later the Germans would have been facing a very different US Navy.|$|E
25|$|With <b>operationalization</b> and {{methodology}} {{derived from the}} general intelligence factor g, a new scientific understanding of collective intelligence, defined as a group’s general ability to perform {{a wide range of}} tasks, aims to explain intelligent behavior of groups. Goal is to detect and explain a general intelligence factor c for groups, parallel to the g factor for individuals. As g is highly interrelated with the concept of IQ, this measurement of collective intelligence can be interpreted as intelligence quotient for groups (Group-IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se. Current evidence suggests that this Group-IQ is only moderately correlated with group members' IQs but with other correlates such as group members' Theory of Mind.|$|E
25|$|The {{air force}} {{was led by}} Lieutenant General C.C.J. Førslev, who had {{previously}} served as colonel {{in the army and}} as first commander of the Danish Army Air Corps. The national command was located at Værløse Air Base which also served as Command East, while Command West was located at Karup in central Jutland. Royal Air Force volunteer and former member of the Free Norwegian Forces in England, Kaj Birksted, was appointed chief of the flying staff. The rivalries and mutual disrespect between the established officer Førslev, who had never been in air combat himself, and the experienced fighter ace Birksted led to a series of misunderstandings which delayed the <b>operationalization</b> of the air force. Further, the East and West commands lacked experience and knowledge of the newly delivered Gloster Meteor and F-84 Thunderjet aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} roles {{developers}} {{play in a}} software project is crucial to understanding the project's collaborative dynamics. Developers are often classified according to the dichotomy of core and peripheral roles. Typically, <b>operationalizations</b> based on simple counts of developer activities (e. g., number of commits) are used for this purpose, but there is concern regarding their validity and ability to elicit meaningful insights. To shed light on this issue, we investigate whether commonly used <b>operationalizations</b> of core [...] peripheral roles produce consistent results, and we validate them with respect to developers' perceptions by surveying 166 developers. Improving over {{the state of the}} art, we propose a relational perspective on developer roles, using developer networks to model the organizational structure, and by examining core [...] peripheral roles in terms of developers' positions and stability within the organizational structure. In a study of 10 substantial open-source projects, we found that the existing and our proposed core [...] peripheral <b>operationalizations</b> are largely consistent and valid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a relational perspective can reveal further meaningful insights, such as that core developers exhibit high positional stability, upper positions in the hierarchy, and high levels of coordination with other core developers...|$|R
25|$|A new {{scientific}} understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general {{ability to perform}} {{a wide range of}} tasks. Definition, <b>operationalization</b> and statistical methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence. Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis. In the same vein as g serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups c factor' (also called 'collective intelligence factor' (CI)) displaying between-group differences on task performance. The collective intelligence score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups even though the concept is hoped to be transferrable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities. Since individuals' g factor scores are highly correlated with full-scale IQ scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of g, this measurement of collective intelligence can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se.|$|E

2500|$|There {{continues}} to be some debate regarding gender differences with relation to domestic violence. Limitations of methodology that fail to capture context (e.g., conflict tactics scale), disparate sampling procedures, respondent reluctance to self-report, and differences in <b>operationalization</b> all pose challenges to existing research. [...] Normalization of domestic violence in those who experience covert forms of abuse, or have been abused by multiple partners, {{for long periods of}} time, reduces the likelihood of recognizing, and therefore reporting domestic violence.|$|E
50|$|The {{theoretical}} constructs {{that constitute}} the health belief model are broadly defined. Furthermore, the health belief model does not specify how constructs of the model interact with one another.

40|$|This study investigates a {{fundamental}} question about human resource systems: where performance synergies amongst human resource practices originate. The existence of synergies {{is a central}} tenet of the strategic, organization level approach to Human Resource Management. Venkatraman (1989) makes the methodological point that different <b>operationalizations</b> of fit (e. g., interaction terms in hierarchical regressions, factor analysis, deviation from ideal profiles) can have markedly different statistical results in the same data set. Until now, this important observation has been treated as methodological caveat. However, these different <b>operationalizations</b> of fit {{can be linked to}} different theoretical rationales for how internal fit (or synergy) occurs in an organizational system. Thus, observations about statistical differences across <b>operationalizations</b> of fit in the same data set allow researchers to draw inferences about the validity of various theoretical explanations for synergies. After extensively comparing many different fit methodologies, the analysis points strongly to additive approaches as the fit methodologies that are most likely to accurately capture the influence on organizational performance attributed to human resource systems. This result points to a related theoretic perspective about interactions among human resource practices which suggests that the strategic value of human resource systems lies in the independent effects of different HR practices that are pointed toward a common goal. ...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} the [...] "Daly Rules", being based on ecological theory and the Laws of Thermodynamics, should perhaps be considered implicit or foundational for the many other systems that are advocated, and are thus the most straightforward system for <b>operationalization</b> of the Bruntland Definition. In this view, the Bruntland Definition and the Daly Rules can be seen as complementary—Bruntland provides the ethical goal of non-depletion of natural capital, Daly details parsimoniously how this ethic is operationalized in physical terms. The system is rationally complete, and in agreement with physical laws. Other definitions may thus be superfluous, or mere glosses on the immutable thermodynamic reality.|$|E

Biologists have criticized transpersonal psychology for its lack of attention to biological foundations of behavior and experience. Physicists have criticized transpersonal psychology for inappropriately accommodating physic concepts as explanations of consciousness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} most closely {{allied with the}} scientist–practitioner model in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear <b>operationalization</b> of the problem, and an emphasis on measurement, including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of goals. These are often met through [...] "homework" [...] assignments in which {{the patient and the}} therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session. The completion of these assignments– which {{can be as simple as}} a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event– indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change. The therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment. Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a therapeutic alliance between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance. Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT. For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first. The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.|$|E

40|$|Because {{vulnerability}} is {{a conceptual}} construct {{rather than a}} directly observable phenomenon, most vulnerability assessments measure a set of “vulnerability indicators”. In order to identify the core approaches and range of variation in the field, we conducted a systematic literature review on local vulnerability to climate change.

Three fully defined relevant frameworks of vulnerability were identified: IPCC, Patterns of Smallholder Vulnerability and Vulnerability as Expected Poverty. Comparative analysis found substantial heterogeneity in frameworks, concepts and <b>operationalizations,</b> {{making it impossible to}} identify patterns of climate vulnerability indicators and determinants that have robust empirical support. If research measuring farmers’ vulnerability to climate change is to have any comparability, it needs greater conceptual coherence and empirical validity.

40|$|Urban {{planners}} frequently {{adhere to}} ‘park minimum standards’ {{to ensure that}} public health and environmental benefits associated with greenspace are socially equitable. These standards denote the extent and placement of greenspaces, but rarely consider their form and function. Arguably, an inclusive evaluation of greenspace social equity requires the comparison of greenspace types. To address if greenspace types are socially equitable, I develop a novel spatial analytic approach that classifies 4265 greenspaces according to twelve functional, physical characteristics. I then compare the social equity of these greenspace types using multiple <b>operationalizations</b> of social equity (provision, accessibility, and population pressure) throughout 4524 neighborhoods in a capital city in Australia. I find that greenspace social equity varies {{for each of these}} types. For example, results reveal that affluent households have an abundance of amenity rich greenspaces and few amenity poor ones. Further, by comparing across multiple social equity <b>operationalizations,</b> I find that affluent households may have a deficit of the amenity poor greenspace type, but live closer to this type. These findings confirm that employing a greenspace typology and multiple social equity <b>operationalizations</b> can deepen our understanding of the association between social equity and greenspace provision. This spatial analytic approach is both adaptable for examining other urban land use types, and portable to other urban contexts, and can aid urban planners, researchers, and policy makers to understand how to improve the social equity of publicly beneficial greenspace types...|$|R
