25|$|Mexico is a Federal Republic {{made up by}} 31 {{states and}} a federal {{district}}. Each state is divided in municipios, while the federal district is divided in sixteen delegaciones. Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico's two remaining territories, Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, achieved statehood on 9 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An <b>ordinary</b> <b>session</b> of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county).

6000|$|Forster {{allowed himself}} to be persuaded by the {{governmental}} agents [...] in Ireland that the root of the evil lay within small compass; [...] that there were in the several parishes a certain limited number [...] of unreasonable and mischievous men, that these men were known to [...] the police, and that if summary powers were confided to the Irish [...] government, by the exercise of which these objectionable persons [...] might be removed, the evil would die out of itself. I must say I [...] never fell into this extraordinary illusion of Forster’s about his [...] ’village ruffian.’ But he was a very impracticable man placed in a [...] position of great responsibility. He was set upon a method of [...] legislation adapted to the erroneous belief that the mischief lay [...] only with a very limited number of well-known individuals, that is [...] to say, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act.... Two points of [...] difference arose: first, as {{to the nature of the}} coercion to be [...] used; secondly, as to its time. I insisted that we were bound to [...] try what we could do against Parnell under the existing law, [...] before asking for extraordinary powers. Both Bright and [...] Chamberlain, if I remember right, did very good service in [...] protesting against haste, and resisting Forster’s desire to [...] anticipate the <b>ordinary</b> <b>session</b> for the purpose of obtaining [...] coercive powers. When, however, the argument of time was exhausted [...] by the Parnell trial(36) and otherwise, I obtained no support from [...] them in regard to the kind of coercion we were to ask. I [...] considered it should be done by giving stringency to the existing [...] law, but not by abolishing the right to be tried before being [...] imprisoned. I felt the pulse of various members of the cabinet, [...] among whom I seem to recollect Kimberley and Carlingford, but I [...] could obtain no sympathy, and to my dismay both Chamberlain and [...] Bright arrived at the conclusion that if there was to be coercion [...] at all, which they lamented, there was something simple and [...] effective in the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act which made [...] such a method preferable to others.(37) I finally acquiesced. It [...] may be asked why? My resistance would have broken up the [...] government or involved my own retirement. My reason for [...] acquiescence was that I bore in mind the special commission under [...] which the government had taken office. It related to the foreign [...] policy of the country, the whole spirit and effect of which we [...] were to reconstruct. This work had not yet been fully [...] accomplished, and it seemed to me that the effective prosecution [...] of it was our first and highest duty. I therefore submitted.|$|E
