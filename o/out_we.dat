5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found <b>out</b> <b>we</b> were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he flicked the ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining we had to tackle like mad dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain to keep them <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> were tremendously relieved at fulltime...|$|E
25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. Whenever we see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> should also remember to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings to the empty string, a, aa, A or AA. Then note that we may also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word problem, here for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E

He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.|$|E
500|$|In {{his rookie}} year, Doby hit 5-for-32 in 29 games. He played four games {{at second base}} and one each at first base and shortstop.

[...] "And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both {{be out of the}} big leagues, just like that. We figured that if we spoke <b>out,</b> <b>we</b> would ruin things for other black players." [...] After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948.

He stated that although the songs are [...] "easy to listen", they [...] "break no new ground". Gabriel Leong of MTV Asia stated that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] sounds [...] "very much like" [...] songs that Debbie Gibson, Tiffany and Bananarama would have recorded in 1980s, a direction that suits Duff [...] "much better than the whole budding rock chick image she's been trying <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> don't want a squabble with Ashlee [...] now, do we Hil?" ...|$|E
500|$|The rural {{setting in}} Marin County {{furnished}} {{the backdrop for}} the domestic bliss associated with the album, and the songs' lyrics contained harmonious references to the [...] "good life at home". In an interview given to New Spotlight magazine at the time, Morrison's wife, Janet Planet referred to Morrison's dislike of socializing at this time: [...] "Really he is a recluse. He is quiet. We never go anywhere. We don't go to parties. We never go <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> have an incredibly quiet life and going on the road is the only excitement we have." [...] Although Morrison said that the songs on the album [...] "had been hanging around [...] " [...] and according to biographer Steve Turner they were written in Woodstock, musician Ronnie Montrose recalled that Morrison wrote one of the tunes, [...] "You're My Woman", [...] while sitting at the piano during the recording sessions in California.|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh to them, and they hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high."

In making this album, we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; when we get together as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought <b>out,</b> <b>we</b> just do it, and we did that with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E

500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|On the album's {{recording}} sessions, Smith noted [...] "there {{was a lot}} {{of drugs}} involved". The band took LSD and drank a lot of alcohol, and to save money, they slept in the office of their record label. The musicians usually turned up at eight, and left at midday looking [...] "fairly deranged". Smith related: [...] "We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night they would bring in supplies. We decided we weren't going to throw anything <b>out.</b> <b>We</b> built this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew". According to Tolhurst, [...] "we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can't remember exactly why, but we did". The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, [...] "At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centered". He also noted that with the album, he [...] "channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something".|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, [...] "... little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." [...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. [...] " [...] lot of the time when he [...] points these things <b>out,</b> <b>we</b> cannot see them at first, but eventually you get it." ...|$|E
