5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk <b>once</b> <b>before,</b> before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

5|$|There {{were already}} {{converts}} to Islam among the city's Greek-speaking Christian population before Gaza's capitulation to the Muslims. At the near {{end of the}} Byzantine era, Gaza had become the home of an increasingly influential group of Arab traders from Mecca, including Umar ibn al-Khattab, who later became the second ruler of the Islamic Caliphate. Muhammad visited the city more than <b>once</b> <b>before</b> being a prophet of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Walker joined Aberdeen on 29 January 2008, {{where he}} was on loan {{till the end of}} the 2007–08 season.

Walker scored his first career goal while on loan at Aberdeen on 14 February 2008 against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup Round of 32. Walker played 13 games in all competitions for Aberdeen, scoring <b>once,</b> <b>before</b> returning to his parent club in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal, {{the match}} favourites and holders of the Football League Cup, were making their fourth final {{appearance}} in the competition. They had won the League Cup <b>once</b> <b>before,</b> in 1987, and lost two consecutive finals in 1968 and 1969. By contrast Luton Town were making their first League Cup final appearance. The club enjoyed relative success in the cups during the 1987–88 season, reaching the last four of the FA Cup and final of the Full Members Cup. Arsenal and Luton had only played each other once in the League Cup; George Graham the present-day manager of Arsenal, scored the decider in a third-round tie on 6 October 1970. Luton's last victory against Arsenal came in March 1986, a 3–0 win in an FA Cup fifth round, second replay.|$|E
5|$|As an amateur, Cotto {{represented}} Puerto Rico in {{the lightweight}} and light welterweight divisions at various international events, including the 1999 Pan American Games, the 2000 Olympics, and the 1998 Junior World Championships; {{the latter in}} which he won a lightweight silver medal. Having begun his professional career in 2001, Cotto defeated Kelson Pinto for the WBO light welterweight title in 2004. He made six successful defenses before vacating the title to move up in weight. In his first welterweight fight, in 2006, Cotto defeated Carlos Quintana for the vacant WBA title. He successfully defended it four times before a career first loss to Antonio Margarito in 2008. The following year, Cotto won the vacant WBO welterweight title and defended it <b>once</b> <b>before</b> losing it to Manny Pacquiao in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} <b>once</b> <b>before</b> when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E

5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only <b>once</b> <b>before</b> the concert.|$|E
5|$|Edward I died in 1307 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward II. The new King at first enjoyed the good will of his nobility, Valence among them. Conflict soon ensued, however, {{connected}} especially with the enormous unpopularity of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. Gaveston's arrogance towards the peers, and his control over Edward, united the Baronage {{in opposition to the}} King. In 1311 the initiative known as the Ordinances was introduced, severely limiting Royal powers in financial matters and in the appointment of officers. Equally important, Gaveston was expelled from the realm - as Edward I had already done <b>once</b> <b>before.</b> Pembroke, who was not among the most radical of the Ordainers, and had earlier been sympathetic with the King, had now realised the necessity of exiling Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy was not {{originally}} {{considered for}} the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down. Instead, George Takei was asked to guest star as he had appeared on the show <b>once</b> <b>before.</b> After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying {{he did not want}} to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority). As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool were {{appearing}} in their ninth final they had won six (1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2001) and lost two (1978, 1987). This was Manchester United's fifth {{appearance in the}} final. They had won once in 1992 and lost three times in 1983, 1991 and 1994. The teams had met <b>once</b> <b>before</b> in the 1983 final, a match which Liverpool won 2–1. The last match {{between the two sides}} before the final was on 1 December 2002, which United won 2–1 courtesy of goals from striker Diego Forlán. Both sides last match before the final was in European competition. Liverpool beat French team Auxerre 2–0 in the second leg of their 2002–03 UEFA Cup fourth round tie, while United beat Italian team Juventus 3–0 in the second group stage of the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, <b>once</b> <b>before</b> the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|On 28 December 1263 Henry {{left for}} France {{to present his}} case to King Louis. Montfort was {{prevented}} from attending by an accident, and he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried <b>once</b> <b>before,</b> in September, {{to appeal to the}} French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only <b>once</b> <b>before.</b> He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
