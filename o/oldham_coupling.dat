50|$|These {{devices are}} known for {{operating}} more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than conventional compressors in some applications. Unlike pistons, the orbiting scroll’s mass can be perfectly counterbalanced, with simple masses, to minimize vibration. (An orbiting scroll cannot be balanced if <b>Oldham</b> <b>coupling</b> is used.) The scroll’s gas processes are more continuous. Additionally, a lack of dead space gives an increased volumetric efficiency.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Oldham</b> <b>coupling</b> {{has three}} discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined {{to the first}} two by tongue and groove. The tongue and groove on one side is {{perpendicular}} to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center {{at the same speed}} as the input and output shafts. Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output shafts. Often springs are used to reduce backlash of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for John Oldham who invented it in Ireland, in 1821, to solve a problem in a paddle steamer design.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is {{to bring about a}} revolution in Manufacturing Industry from Mass-Production Manufacturing to Tailor-Made Manufacturing in which products are manufactured according to the whims of the customer. For that, Rapid Prototyping (RP) method was used for making a prototype or pattern for casting a product. A new method for investment casting was found out using RP: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). RP parts were also tested for using them as a pattern for sand casting. Software named “AUTOCAST-X” was used for designing and simulating zero defect casting. A case study of a middle disc of <b>Oldham</b> <b>coupling</b> was done, in which the disc was produced using both the new investment casting and the sand casting and the parts made by both the methods were compared. Views of foundry personnel were recorded on using RP Patterns in sand casting. They found it very helpful in case of intricate and complicated pattern designs which cannot be made by a pattern maker in wood or metal...|$|E
40|$|In direct {{mechanical}} drive system, coupling of various driven elements is required. Majority of drive elements like gear reducers, lead screws {{and host of}} other components are driven by shaft that is supported by multiple bearings. Due to rigidity of coupling, slight misalignments will be there between a driving and driven shaft. The function of power transmission coupling is transmitting torque from driving shaft to drive shaft along with shaft misalignment. Misalignment in shaft may results into unwanted strains on shaft bearings causing to wear out. Few conventional solutions are available for misalignment problems like <b>Oldham’s</b> <b>coupling</b> and universal joint which have several limitations. These limitations can be overcome with Thompson constant velocity (CV) coupling which offers features like minimizing side loads, higher misalignment capabilities, more operating speeds, improved efficiency of transmission and many more. This paper presents review on constant velocity joints/couplings design and optimization. In this paper the research work of various researchers related to transmission couplings and constant velocity joints is reviewed...|$|R

5000|$|Stanton {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, grew up nearby in Chagrin Falls, {{attended}} Princeton University, where he {{earned a degree in}} English, and then joined the Army Air Corps, where he served as a flight officer and flew glider planes in France during the Second World War. After the war, Stanton began working as a full-time freelance writer and moved to Bolinas, California. He returned to Chagrin Falls in the mid-fifties, still writing full-time, and participated in the Chagrin Falls Little Theater, where he acted lead roles, including as Charles in [...] "Blithe Spirit". It was there that he met his second wife, Elizabeth [...] "Betty" [...] Kain <b>Oldham.</b> The <b>couple</b> had seven children, six of them boys, all of whom provided ample material for stories. From Chagrin Falls, Will moved his family to Mantua, Ohio; then to Cambridge, Maryland; New London, Connecticut; and, finally, to his wife's family home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where after ten years, he died. As long as there was a post office, he could live anywhere, he would say.|$|R
40|$|In scroll compressors, the Oldham {{couplings}} {{have typically}} been formed of aluminum alloy and have often broken issues {{due to the}} higher force that transmitted to <b>Oldham</b> <b>coupling</b> by the orbiting scroll. This problem was especially pronounced in scroll compressors and in particular during flooded start or slug conditions. Â So, to enhance Oldham couplingâ€™s strength performance in above conditions becomes an important work to Engineers. In this paper, about 30 pcs failed Oldham couplings which were broken in by flood start or slug conditions were investigated. Meanwhile, Oldham couplingâ€™s stress distribution and deformation were simulated in ANSYS software. High stress zones and weak positions were got; potential failure risks were also reappeared in the simulation. After simulation, two optimized proposals were stated and simulated. And then, corresponding prototypes were made and sent to test together with mass production parts in lab. Tests results indicate new designâ€™s strength performances were improved and highly aligned with numerical simulation results. But, some test errors were also found between mass production parts and prototypes. The factors which can impact errors and their weight were analyzed and calculated. In the end, a prediction model of using numerical model to estimate mass production part performance is given in this paper. ...|$|E
