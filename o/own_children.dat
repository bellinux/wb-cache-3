40|$|Maternal {{sensitive}} behavior {{depends on}} recognizing one's <b>own</b> <b>child's</b> affective states. The present study investigated distinct and overlapping neural responses of mothers to sad and happy facial expressions of their <b>own</b> <b>child</b> (in comparison to facial expressions of an unfamiliar child). We used functional MRI to measure dissociable and overlapping activation patterns in 27 healthy mothers {{in response to}} happy, neutral and sad facial expressions of their <b>own</b> school-aged <b>child</b> and a gender- and age-matched unfamiliar child. To investigate differential activation to sad compared to happy faces of one's <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> we used interaction contrasts. During the scan, mothers had to indicate the affect of the presented face. After scanning, {{they were asked to}} rate the perceived emotional arousal and valence levels for each face using a 7 -point Likert-scale (adapted SAM version). While viewing their <b>own</b> <b>child's</b> sad faces, mothers showed activation in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex whereas happy facial expressions of the <b>own</b> <b>child</b> elicited activation in the hippocampus. Conjoint activation in response to one's <b>own</b> <b>child</b> happy and sad expressions was found in the insula and the superior temporal gyrus. Maternal brain activations differed depending on the child's affective state. Sad faces of the <b>own</b> <b>child</b> activated areas commonly associated with a threat detection network, whereas happy faces activated reward related brain areas. Overlapping activation was found in empathy related networks. These distinct neural activation patterns might facilitate sensitive maternal behavior...|$|R

Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.|$|E
5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their <b>own</b> <b>children</b> together and shared child care responsibilities. Uncles, brothers, and other male relatives sometimes helped out. Romantic relationships {{between men and women}} were formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's extended family.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E

Although Sita wanted Mary to teach her music, Mary's short temper diminishes her confidence and Rao takes over her music lessons.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign {{also saw}} {{the rise of the}} Guise brothers, Charles, who became a cardinal, and Henry's boyhood friend Francis, who became Duke of Guise.

At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis. Catherine brought her up with her <b>own</b> <b>children</b> at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's regent.|$|E

5|$|José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal {{was born}} in 1933 (exact date is unknown) {{in the town of}} Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. His younger brother Miguel {{was born in}} 1940. While in school Vázquez met and befriended Fernando Cisneros Carrillo. The {{friendship}} between the two was so strong that they considered each other brothers, and Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez as one of their <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> After leaving school they both went their separate ways, not seeing each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} emphasis was the children's fascination with Maurice Richard. Montreal's star player from 1942 until 1960, Richard was a prolific goal scorer. In the 1944–45 season– {{one year before}} the events of The Hockey Sweater– Richard became the first player in National Hockey League history to score 50 goals in a 50-game season. Richard attended the 1980 premiere of The Sweater in Montreal, and according to Carrier, was moved to tears by the film. Richard also requested copies {{so that he could}} show it to his <b>own</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the book was terminated by Bernoulli's death in 1705; thus the book is essentially incomplete when compared with Bernoulli's original vision. The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most competent person who could have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann {{to get hold of}} the manuscript. Jacob's <b>own</b> <b>children</b> were not mathematicians and were not up to the task of editing and publishing the manuscript. Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish the manuscript in 1713.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien never {{expected}} his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident {{a book called}} The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> came in 1936 {{to the attention of}} Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her <b>own</b> <b>children).</b> The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E
