Ammonal's ease of detonation depends on fuel and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminum being fairly sensitive, however not very <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced.</b> Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due {{to the formation of}} tetramines.

It is soluble in methyl nitrate. It solidifies to a glass at -46°, starts to slowly decompose at 75°, and inflames, without oxygen required, around 200°. When it burns it produces alumina, nitrogen, water and carbon monoxide. It is being proposed as a rocket propellant, {{because it has}} better performance than hydrazine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> is an {{expression}} {{that is used to}} indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to convert all of its carbon to carbon dioxide, all of its hydrogen to water, and all of its metal to metal oxide with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance.</b> The molecule is said to have a positive <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> if it contains less oxygen than is needed. The sensitivity, strength, and brisance of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> and tend to approach their maxima as <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> approaches zero.|$|R
50|$|One area {{in which}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> can be applied is in the {{processing}} of mixtures of explosives. The family of explosives called amatols are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and TNT. Ammonium nitrate has an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of +20% and TNT has an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of −74%, so {{it would appear that}} the mixture yielding an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of zero would also result in the best explosive properties. In actual practice a mixture of 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT by weight yields an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of +1%, the best properties of all mixtures, and an increase in strength of 30% over TNT.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> (OB, or OB%) is an {{expression}} {{that is used to}} indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to form carbon dioxide from carbon, water from hydrogen molecules, all of its sulfur dioxide from sulfur, and all metal oxides from metals with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance.</b> The molecule is said to have a positive <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> if it contains less oxygen than is needed; the combustion will then be incomplete, and large amount of toxic gases like carbon monoxide will be present. The sensitivity, strength, and brisance of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> and tend to approach their maxima as <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> approaches zero.|$|R
40|$|OuY 4 In the {{recovery}} of acids from the nitration of toluene to TNT, it is possible under certain conditions to obtain mixtures of nitroaromatic compounds, primarily-mono- and dinitrotoluene with nitrogen tetroxide (N OI) and/or tetranitromethane (TNM). Since these mixtures contain rather strong oxidizers and a fuel, they have the potential of being highly sensitive liquid explosives. Studies showed such mixtures are not exceptionally sensitive to mechanical impact and friction or thermal initiation. However, these mixtures at <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced</b> proportions are extremely sensitive to induced shock and are capable of propagating explosive reactions at film thicknesses less than 0. 5 mm. In the standard NOL card gap cest, <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced</b> mixtures of N 1 O 2 with nitrobody exhibited an attenuator thickness of greater than 155 cm as compared to 3. 8 cm for TNT. Shock sensitive mixtures of N 204 and nitrobody can collect in fume and acid recovery operations.

The ZnO thin films were deposited by a planar r. f. magnetron sputterer onto n-type 6 H silicon carbide wafers. These devices were employed as Schottky diodes and operated in constant current mode. Exposure to different concentrations of {{hydrogen gas}} results in {{changes in the}} device&# 039;s carrier concentration and hence in the Schottky barrier height.

40|$|Here we {{investigate}} the thermodynamic states occurring in explosion fields from the detonation of condensed explosives in air. In typical applications, {{the pressure of}} expanded detonation products gases is modeled by a Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) function: P{sub JWL} = f(v,s{sub CJ}); constants in that function are fit to cylinder test data. This function provides a specification of pressure {{as a function of}} specific volume, v, along the expansion isentrope (s = constant = s{sub CJ}) starting at the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) state. However, the JWL function is not a fundamental equation of thermodynamics, and therefore gives an incomplete specification of states. For example, explosions inherently involve shock reflections from surfaces; this changes the entropy of the products, and in such situations the JWL function provides no information on the products states. In addition, most explosives are not <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced,</b> so if hot detonation products mix with air, they after-burn, releasing the heat of reaction via a turbulent combustion process. This raises the temperature of explosion products cloud to the adiabatic flame temperature ({approx} 3, 000 K). Again, the JWL function provides no information on the combustion products states...|$|E
50|$|Because sensitivity, brisance, and {{strength}} are properties {{resulting from a}} complex explosive chemical reaction, a simple relationship such as <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> cannot be depended upon to yield universally consistent results. When using <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> to predict properties of one explosive relative to another, {{it is to be}} expected that one with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> closer to zero will be the more brisant, powerful, and sensitive; however, many exceptions to this rule do exist. More complicated predictive calculations, such as those discussed in the next section of the explosive materials article, result in more accurate predictions.|$|R
50|$|One quality this {{explosive}} has, that PETN does not, is {{a positive}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance.</b> Having a positive <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> means that ETN possesses more than enough oxygen in its structure to fully oxidize all of its carbon and hydrogen upon detonation.

40|$|Oxygen is {{a product}} of {{photosynthesis}} and is essential for human survival. It also has a profound effect on ecosystems as the atmospheric <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> is the basis for regional ecological sustainability. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) has experienced rapid urbanization and has become one of China’s three major urban agglomerations. This study focused on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of the PRD in 2011, and established a model to calculate the <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> that was suitable for a region of rapid urbanization by applying remote sensing gross primary production data via the C-Fix model. The influencing factors for the oxygen imbalance were analyzed and it was suggested that more attention be paid to the management of oxygen emissions than oxygen consumption. The results indicated that the <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> capacity of the PRD was weak, with an oxygen consumption 9. 37 times that of its oxygen emission. Zhaoqing and Huizhou are the main sources of oxygen in the PRD, with an oxygen emission density more than 4. 67 times that of Dongguan or Zhuhai. Guangzhou and Shenzhen are the main oxygen sinks, with a total oxygen consumption more than 5. 49 times that of Zhaoqing. Moreover, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of the PRD is more sensitive to oxygen emissions than consumption.

This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of argon against neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. In vitro cortical neuronal cell cultures derived from rat foetuses were subjected to an oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) challenge for 90 minutes and then exposed to 70 % argon or nitrogen with 5 % carbon dioxide and balanced with oxygen for 2 hours. In vivo, seven-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxic (8 % <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced</b> with nitrogen) insult for 90 minutes. They were exposed to 70 % argon or nitrogen balanced with oxygen for 2 hours. In vitro, argon treatment of cortical neuronal cultures resulted in a significant increase of p-mTOR and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (Nrf 2) and protection against OGD challenge. Inhibition of m-TOR through Rapamycin or Nrf 2 through siRNA abolished argon-mediated cyto-protection. In vivo, argon exposure significantly enhanced Nrf 2 and its down-stream effector NAD(P) H Dehydrogenase, Quinone 1 (NQO 1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1). Oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death were significantly decreased and brain infarction was markedly reduced. Blocking PI- 3 K through wortmannin or ERK 1 / 2 through U 0126 attenuated argon-mediated neuroprotection. These data provide a new molecular mechanism for the potential application of Argon as a neuroprotectant in HIE...|$|E

Therefore, understanding the relationship between carbon sources and sinks is the first step toward mitigating the effect of urban areas on climate change.

In this study, the carbon sequestration and oxygen emission capabilities of various LULC types were calculated, and the partitioning of carbon emissions and oxygen consumption in Beijing were estimated. The evaluation results indicated that the ecosystem services from the LULC in an area were not adequate to offset the urban carbon emissions and oxygen consumption. The areas with a high capacity for carbon sequestration and oxygen emissions were primarily distributed in the exurban districts of Beijing, and the carbon and <b>oxygen</b> <b>balances</b> in the exurban districts were superior to those of core urban areas.

40|$|ObjectiveDuring {{repair of}} aortic coarctation through a left {{thoracotomy}} without cardiopulmonary bypass, clamping the proximal transverse aortic arch occludes antegrade {{flow to the}} left carotid and vertebral arteries. It is assumed that flow through the right carotid and vertebral arteries is adequate for cerebral perfusion. The study objective is to determine whether aortic occlusion impairs left hemispheric cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. MethodsIn 18 children having repair of aortic coarctation, we measured the maximum change and integral for hemoglobin D (difference of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin), total oxygenation index, and the redox state of cytochrome aa 3. Thirteen subjects had recordings from the left hemisphere {{to test the hypothesis}} that aortic occlusion impairs left hemispheric <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance.</b> Five subjects had recordings from the right hemisphere for comparison. ResultsAfter aortic clamping, a significant decrease in hemoglobin D was observed in recordings from the left hemisphere compared with those from the right hemisphere (P =. 03, maximum change in hemoglobin D). Total oxygenation index and cytochrome aa 3 were generally preserved. There was an inverse linear relationship for the change in hemoglobin D during clamp application and after removal (Spearman rho = − 0. 74), with increased hemoglobin D after clamp removal in those subjects with the greatest decrease of hemoglobin D during arch occlusion. Linear regression analysis identified nitroprusside administration as significantly associated with a decrease in hemoglobin D (P <. 001). ConclusionsSignificant impairment in left hemispheric cerebral <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> was identified during arch clamping.
