5|$|The Crusader armies {{crossed over}} into Asia Minor {{during the first}} half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, Manuel Boutoumites and Tatikios, to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was Nicaea, previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rum under Kilij Arslan I. Arslan was away campaigning against the Danishmends in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.|$|E

After hearing it, she begged the composer in tears to let her arrange it for piano duet. However, illness intervened and Tchaikovsky made the arrangement himself.|$|E
25|$|Five {{months after}} Yale's injury, on July 15, 1921, he, his brother Angelo, and four men were driving on Cropsey Avenue in Bath Beach when another car filled with rival gunmen overtook them and opened fire. Angelo {{and one of}} Yale's men were wounded. This attack was {{believed}} to have been carried out in revenge for the June 5th killing of a Manhattan mobster named Ernesto Melchiorre, who had been murdered after a late-night visit to the Harvard Inn. Melchiorre's brother Silvio was {{believed to have been}} {{the driving force behind the}} unsuccessful attack.

500|$|Asturias's {{home country}} celebrated his {{international}} recognition. In Guatemala his face soon adorned postage stamps, a street {{was named after}} him, and he received a medal. According to Kjell Strömberg in The 1967 Prize, [...] "the whole <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> country was given over to rejoicing". Further admiration was expressed throughout Latin America, where Asturias's Nobel Prize was viewed as an accomplishment for Latin American literature as a whole, rather than the achievement of a single author or country. As scholar Richard Jewell notes, there had been substantial criticism that Latin American writers were being ignored by the Nobel committee. Beginning with Miguel Ángel Asturias in 1967, however, the academy selected four Latin American writers within twenty-four years.|$|E

Brewster among them. [...] McCay bets the group that in one month he can make 4000 drawings move. [...] The group laughs and gestures that he is drunk or crazy. [...] McCay sets to work in a studio where he directs workers to move around bundles of paper and barrels of ink. [...] A month later, McCay gathers his colleagues in front of a film projector.

[...] The strip had no recurring characters, but followed a theme: after eating a Welsh rarebit, the day's protagonist would be subject to the darker side of his or her psyche. [...] Typically, the strip would begin with an absurd situation which became more and more absurd until the Fiend—the dreamer—awakened in the final panel. [...] Some situations were merely silly: elephants falling from the ceiling, or two women's mink coats having a fight. [...] Other times, they could be more disturbing: characters finding themselves dismembered, buried alive from a first-person perspective or a child's mother being planted and becoming a tree. [...] In some strips the Fiend was a spectator watching fantastic or horrible things happen to someone close to [...] [...] The protagonists are typically urban bourgeoisie whom McCay subjects to fears of public humiliation or loss of social esteem or respectability.|$|E

After she grabs all the banknotes out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> suitcase and runs away, the musician follows the singer to brace her, but she convinces him to spend all the money. Together they start buying ice cream and stealing clothes in a shop. At sunset, Inna and the musician meet some friends {{on the beach at}} a bonfire. After spending the night in a tent on the beach, they secretly ride along on the load space of a pick-up truck the next morning and leave the town. Subsequently, Inna and the man arrive in a desert and hitch a ride by holding a sign reading [...] "Anywhere". After getting a ride, they leave the car on a motel next to the road, where Inna enters to sing on a stage. The singer then tries to make a phone call, with the musician flirting with a blond girl at the bar. Inna kisses her on the mouth and then chooses a jukebox track. This is followed by the singer and him renting a room for the night.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, Townsend sold most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Little</b> River Lumber tract to {{the newly}} created Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, {{although}} {{he had been given}} permission to continue logging for most of the next decade. By the time the company ceased operations in 1939, it had produced 750 million board feet (1.8 million m³) of lumber. [...] In the 1960s, the park service built the current campground over the site of the former logging town.

2500|$|Walter Crick, his uncle, {{lived in}} a small house {{on the south side of}} Abington Avenue; he had a shed at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> garden where he taught Crick to blow glass, do {{chemical}} experiments and to make photographic prints. When he was eight or nine he transferred to the most junior form of the Northampton Grammar School, on the Billing Road. This was about [...] from his home so he could walk there and back, by Park Avenue South and Abington Park Crescent, but he more often went by bus or, later, by bicycle. The teacher – a Miss Holding – was an inspired teacher and made everything interesting. The teaching in the higher forms was satisfactory, but not as stimulating. After the age of 14, he was educated at Mill Hill School in London (on scholarship), where he studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry with his best friend John Shilston. He shared the Walter Knox Prize for Chemistry on Mill Hill School's Foundation Day, Friday, 7 July 1933. He declared that his success was inspired by the quality of teaching he received whilst a pupil at Mill Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Cornwallis {{was given}} the thanks of both Houses of Parliament, but fell out of favour with the Admiralty in October 1795 in a dispute about naval {{discipline}} and was court-martialed and censured in 1796 for abandoning a convoy to the West Indies due to damage to Royal Sovereign and ill-health. He entered retirement that year, but in 1801 he was given command of the Channel Fleet by Earl St Vincent {{and for the next}} five years led the blockade of the French Atlantic Fleet, most notably during the Trafalgar campaign of 1805 when he sent reinforcements to the fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson at a critical juncture. British historians have highly praised the conduct of Cornwallis and his men at the unequal battle: In 1825 Brenton wrote that Cornwallis's Retreat is [...] "justly considered one of the finest displays of united courage and coolness to be found in our naval history." [...] while in 1827 William James wrote of the [...] "masterly retreat of Vice-admiral Cornwallis" [...] in which [...] "the spirit manifested by the different ships' companies <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> squadron, while pressed upon by a force from its threefold superiority so capable of crushing them, was just as ought always to animate British seamen when in the presence of an enemy." [...] Modern historian Robert Gardiner echoed this sentiment, noting in 1998 that [...] "'Cornwallis's Retreat' became as famous as many of the Royal Navy's real victories." ...|$|E

He was transferred to the National Geographic editorial staff and wrote an account of the expedition for the magazine, accompanied by his photography. On nearing the mountain, the expedition decided to attempt the unclimbed West Ridge, and Bishop helped establish a route up to the summit pyramid at [...] before transferring to the portion of the team attempting the South Col. Via that route, Jim Whittaker summitted on May 1, becoming the first American to do so. In the following weeks, Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld continued the attempt on the West Ridge, and Bishop and Lute Jerstad attempted the South Col. After a stove accident early on the morning of May 22, the pair began the summit attempt, reaching the South Summit at 2:00p.m. and the main summit at 3:30. They waited on the summit for signs of Hornbein and Unsoeld, who were also due to reach the summit that day, but short of oxygen and seeing no sign of them, they began the descent at 4:15. As darkness fell around 7:30, they made voice contact with Hornbein and Unsoeld, who had summitted and were descending the South Col. After rendezvousing and descending further, the four decided to bivouac. During the night, temperatures reached 18°F, and Bishop sustained frostbite that would result in the loss of all his toes and the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>little</b> finger.|$|E
