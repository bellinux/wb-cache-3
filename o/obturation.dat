25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called <b>obturation.</b> To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to apply microcomputed {{tomography}} to quantitative evaluation of voids and to test any specific location of voids in tooth’s root canal <b>obturations.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty root canals were prepared and obturated with gutta-percha and Tubli-Seal sealer using the thermoplastic compaction method (System B + Obtura II). Roots were scanned and three-dimensional visualization was obtained. The volume and Feret’s diameter of I-voids (at the filling/dentine interface) and S-voids (surrounded by filling material) were measured. Results: The results revealed that none of the scanned root canal fillings were void-free. For I-voids, the volume fraction was significantly larger, but their number was lower (P = 0. 0007), than for S-voids. Both types of voids occurred in characteristic regions (P &lt; 0. 001). I-voids occurred mainly in the apical third, while S-voids in the coronal third of the canal filling. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, our results indicate that microtomography, with proposed semi-automatic algorithm, is a useful tools for three-dimensional quantitative evaluation of dental root canal fillings. In canals filled with thermoplastic gutta-percha and Tubli-Seal, voids at the interface between the filling and canal dentine deserve special attention due to of their periapical location, which might promote apical microleakage.

The canals were irrigated abundantly with 1 -% sodium hypochlorite solution. After they were dried and divided in 3 groups in agreement with the canal wall treatment. Group 1 : the canals were filled with EDTA for 3 minutes, followed by irrigation with 1 -% sodium hypochlorite solution; Group 2 : the canal walls were irradiated with Nd:YAG laser; and Group 3 : the canal walls were irradiated with Er:YAG laser. Afterwards, the root canals of all the specimens were obturated with gutta-percha cones and Top-Seal cement, by the lateral condensation technique. The roots were externally waterproof, except in the apical foramen and, immerged in aqueous solution of 2 % methylene blue during 48 hours.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to verify the {{variations}} of the temperature inside the root canal with three different gutta-percha heating systems. Materials and Methods: A split-tooth model was built with a lateral groove at 3. 5 -mm from working length (WL) in order to insert a Chromel-Alumel K-type thermocouple placed in contact with gutta-percha. The thermocouple was connected to a digital thermometer. Sixty <b>obturations</b> were made with medium gutta-percha points. For 20 specimens the System B was used with the Buchanan fine plugger and the temperature was set at 200 C; for other 20 specimens the Endo-Twinn with a fine plugger was used and for the last 20 specimens we used the E-Fill with a 40. 04 plugger. All pluggers were pushed to 3. 5 mm from WL so that the tips were in contact to the probe. Results: The analysis of 60 samples showed the highest temperature average using the System B after 10 seconds (86. 85 C), after 15 seconds (94. 9 C), after 20 seconds (100. 4 C) and after 25 seconds (104. 5 C). The Endo-Twinn average values are similar to System-B ones. The E-Fill average values are lower (69. 9 C) than the other two systems evaluated only after 10 seconds due to limited working time. The temperatures average obtained using different systems of warm vertical compaction are lower than what was declared by the producing companies.

40|$|The University of Pretoria Oral Health Centre (UPOHC) {{houses the}} School of Dentistry where dental, oral hygiene and post {{graduate}} students are trained. Dentists employed at the School of Dentistry {{generally do not}} complete root canal treatments (RCTs) due to their academic and research commitments but mainly perform emergency dental procedures such as pulpectomies for the relief of acute pain. The pulpectomy procedure includes the extirpation of the necrotic or inflamed pulp, minimal shaping of the canal and irrigating with sodium hypochlorite. This is followed by placing a medicament with an anti-inflammatory action such as Ledermix® or calcium hydroxide and sealing the tooth with a temporary restoration. The patient is then placed {{on a waiting list}} (approximately 18 months) for completion of the RCT by students in their fourth and fifth year of study. Dentists complete RCTs mainly in cases where previous attempts made to locate the canals were not successful orwhere files have fractured in the canals or when retreatment is indicated. The students complete a limited number of RCTs due to the time-consuming nature of the procedure and their relative lack of skill and experience. During the fourth year of study the students are required to complete five RCTs on teeth with one and two canals.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Daylighting {{is the use of}} natural light to replace artificial light. In traditional rooms sunlight will only illuminate the area closest to the window due to the high solar angle. The rear of the room appears gloomy and occupants will use electric lighting even though there is sufficient daylight to illuminate the interior. The first section of this thesis reports on the application of micro-prisms to glazing. Such systems could improve the penetration of the light and reduce the energy bill. Fig 1 : (Left) : A traditional window. (Right) A window with the top third coated in microprisms. The aim of the work is to develop suitable structures than can be easily and cheaply mass produced using an industrial UV embossing process. Whenever possible the requirements of this process dictate the physical characteristics of the microstructures. The development process includes all the stages from design to full-scale testing of the prototypes in an office. Several different mechanical methods are used to produce prismatic arrays that conform to an initial design calculation. Each sample is evaluated in terms of its physical characteristics, its optical properties and finally its ability to improve illumination within a room. The latter aspect is determined, not only by measurement, but also the subjective assessment of occupants. The second micro-textured surface to be examined is the microlens. Three systems are investigated: - A controlled diffuser incorporating cylindrical lenses to improve the distribution of the daylight. - An afocal pair of lenses to improve the penetration of daylight through beam-steering. - An angular filter to exclude direct sunlight while admitting diffuse light. Most of the research is concerned with the third system. On sunny days windows can cause sufficient glare that occupants will pull the venetian blinds. Not only will this exclude the direct sunlight but also the diffuse daylight, cause darkening of the room and leading to the use of artificial light. The angular filter or 'solar shade' uses microlenses to image the direct sunlight which can then be blocked by circular <b>obturations.</b> The diffuse sunlight is not focused and therefore transmitted so the room is not darkened. The research is based on experimentation with small-scale systems and computer modelling to optimise the system.
