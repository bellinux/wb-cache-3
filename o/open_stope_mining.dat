The advantages offered by this high density tailings backfill include: a lower total cost associated with backfill placement, reduction of excess water underground; and the elimination of the need to process the tailings prior to placement. However, almost all backfill design is based on the performance of laboratory prepared samples since it is difficult to obtain undisturbed samples and conduct in situ testing {{due to the lack of}} access to backfilled stopes and the safety concerns in accessible areas. The logistical problems associated with conducting in situ testing and obtaining undisturbed samples of cemented paste backfill (CPB) has lead to the reliance in the mining industry on performance data obtained from laboratory prepared CPB samples. The degree to which these laboratory prepared samples represent the actual in situ condition is not well defined, partly because the influence of the mixing, transport and placement process on the material properties it is not well understood. Therefore, there is a need in the industry to understand how the material properties and hence the performance of the laboratory prepared CPB compares with in situ material.

40|$|Open stoping is {{a common}} mining method {{employed}} in the Canadian mining industry. Extracting large volumes of rock can present stability issues which can affect productivity and safety. Many factors such as changing stress states, rock mass structure, and intact rock strength can contribute to instability. One factor not commonly assessed when examining stope stability is exposure time. With increased exposure time, the rock quality of the opening tends to degrade. Birchtree Mine located in Thompson, Manitoba, {{is the focus of}} this study due to the time dependent instability that has been observed. For the proposed project, an empirical method was chosen since these methods can easily be updated with future case histories to better reflect onsite conditions. Few empirical methods exist for assessing exposure time for <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining.</b> The most common method of incorporating time with stability is Bieniawski’s 1989 RMR Stand-up Time Graph. As part of this project the original data used to create the RMR Stand-up Time Graph was reinterpreted so it could be plotted on the Stability Graph, which is used for open stope design. Case histories from the Birchtree mine, along with the original database for Bieniawski’s empirical method, have been examined. Comparisons were conducted to evaluate the accuracy and validity of the Bieniawski and Birchtree data. Other factors that may affect stability and exposure time were also discussed.

40|$|Empirical design {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for rock mechanics evaluations. An appropriate method of rock mass classification is required to use these empirical methods. There are limitations for rock mass classification methods when access to the ore zone is restricted. The Cameco Corporation Eagle Point Mine in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, uses the longhole <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> method for the recovery of uranium ore. The Modified Dilution graph {{is used for the}} prediction of stope hanging wall dilution. The mine currently uses a rock mass classification based on an estimate of the alteration and strength of a rock mass from geological drift mapping. Since this method is highly subjective, point load testing of diamond drill hole core was completed to attempt to correlate the alteration and strength of different rock types to remove the user subjectivity. The results of the testing indicated a general trend of decreasing rock strength with increasing alteration, albeit with considerable scatter. A repeatable, standardized method of evaluating the stope geometry and inferred rock mass classification for reconciliation purposes was developed. The standardized stope evaluation method removes significant subjectivity currently involved in estimates of stope geometries and the magnitude of dilution. A new lithology based method for interpreting the mine specific geological alteration and strength classification system was developed based on several sources of rock mass classification observations. This resulted in a correlation linking individual rock mass property descriptions between different classification systems for an improved estimate of the Q’ classification value. This improved method of estimating the rock classification Q’ value, as well as conventional techniques for linking classification systems, was used in a stope reconciliation process to predict open stope dilution. Twenty-seven stope reconciliation case histories were documented and used to compare predicted and measured dilution, based on three different approaches for estimating rock mass classification values. The results showed a minor improvement in dilution prediction using the approach developed in this study. The systematic stope reconciliation and rock mass classification approach did highlight areas in the weak pegmatoidal rocks where improved rock classification estimates should be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Olympic Dam {{underground}} mine {{is located in}} South Australia approximately 520 km north-north-west of Adelaide. The copper-gold-uranium deposit is extracted by <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining.</b> The empirical Mathews stability method {{has been applied to}} open stope stability forecasting at Olympic Dam for the more than 20 years. This method adjusts the rock tunneling quality index (Q’) to allow for a rock stress factor, the orientation of any discontinuity and the orientation of the geometric surface formed by the excavation. The applicability of the Mathews stability method at Olympic Dam was analysed by assessing the volume of over break outside the stope design profile. It was found that 41 % of all stope surface predictions were correct, and that 59 % (by difference) of all predictions were therefore incorrect. This was found to be primarily due to the method as applied at Olympic Dam, rather than the inherent errors of the Mathews stability method. However {{there are a number of}} weaknesses in the Mathews stability method including the inability to identify structural weaknesses in the rock mass, to allow for different stress concentrations around irregular shaped stopes and to account for stope relaxation. A high resolution non-linear, Hoek Brown, numerical model is capable of providing displacement, velocity and strain rates for points within a rock mass. Velocity is the modelled rate of displacement of the points within the rock mass relative to the stope profile. An existing numerical model of this sort at Olympic Dam was used to investigate the relationship of the velocity of points moving toward a stope, and the probability of them becoming over break. It was found that with increasing rates of velocity the probability of a point becoming over break increased. The identified limitations of the application of the Mathews stability method are not enough to justify removing the method from the stope design process at Olympic Dam. With the implementation of recommended improvements such as, increasing the frequency of window mapping collection, live stress measurements and detailed post-mining assessment of stopes, an increase in the methods reliability can be expected. These improvements should be incorporated in conjunction with the continued trial of velocity as a stope performance indicator at Olympic Dam...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of open stope stability and dilution research which focused on evaluating and quantifying stress, undercutting, blasting and exposure time and their effect on open stope stability and dilution. <b>Open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> is the most common method of underground mining in Canada. Unplanned stope dilution is a major cost factor for many mining operations. Significant advances in empirical stability and dilution design methods have improved our ability to predict probable dilution from open stoping operations. However, some of the factors that influence hanging wall dilution are either ignored or assessed in purely subjective terms in existing designs. This thesis attempts to quantify these factors, from a geomechanics perspective, to assist in predicting and minimizing dilution. A comprehensive database was established for this study based on two summers of field work. Site geomechanics rock mass mapping and classification were conducted and case histories were collected from Cavity Monitoring System (CMS) surveyed stopes from Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. (HBMS) operations. The stope hanging wall (HW) zone of stress relaxation was quantified based on extensive 2 D and 3 D numerical modelling. Stress relaxation was linked to the stope geometry and the degree of adjacent mining activity. The influence of undercutting on stope HW stability and dilution was analysed using the case histories collected from HBMS mines. An undercutting factor (UF) was developed to account for the undercutting influence on stope HW dilution. Numerical simulations were conducted to provide a theoretical basis for the undercutting factor. A relationship was observed between the degree of undercutting, expressed by the UF term and the measured dilution. Many factors can significantly and simultaneously affect a blast performance, which may result in blast damage to stope walls. Major blasting factors which influence stope HW stability were identified. The influence of blasting on stope HW stability and dilution was evaluated based on the established database. The HBMS database, Bieniawski’s stand-up time graph, as well as Geco mine case histories were used to evaluate the influence of exposure time on stope stability and dilution. Relating increased mining time to increased dilution allows the mining engineer to equate mining delays to dilution costs. Each of the factors assessed in this study was studied independently to assess its influence on stope dilution, based on the HBMS database. The factors influencing dilution often work together, so a multiple parameter regression model was used to analyze the available parameters in the HBMS database. The findings of this research greatly improve an engineer’s ability to understand and to predict the influence of mining activities and stoping plans on hanging wall dilution...|$|E
40|$|Premier Diamond mine had to plan, {{develop and}} operate a low cost, mass mining method to recover {{extensive}} ore reserves below a 75 metre thick, dipping gabbro sill. The mining method had to preclude {{the extraction of}} {{as much of the}} 52 million tons of barren waste contained in the gabbro sill as possible and ensure the safety of personnel and operations. Consequent on the failure of the <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> method first attempted, a geotechnical investigation showed that ore recovery by caving methods was possible. The fragmentation that reported to the drawpoints would be coarse and the production horizon would be situated in relatively weak rock. The increased depth or mining, experience on the mine in using LHD's, changes in mining technology and the high production rate required, determined that Premier Diamond Mine could implement a mechanised cave using LHD's for ore extraction. Parameters that need to be defined to successfully exploit any orebody considering cave mining methods include (Cummings et al., 1984) : * The area that must be undercut to induce continuous caving. * The fragmentation that will result as the orebody caves and the fragmentation size distribution that report to drawpoints. The size distribution will determine drawpoint spacing, secondary blasting procedures and equipment. ore pass diameters, as well as tunnel and LHD sizes. * The rock mass response to the mining operations must be understood and used to optimise the mining sequence. Once the rock on the production level has been damaged by high abutment stresses, maintaining the stability of excavations can be expensive and time consuming. * Support systems and time or installation must be carefully planned and controlled. The function and potential method of failure of the support clements must be understood * Draw control and analysis or draw control data is important to ensure that premature waste ingress is minimised and that stress related problems that can result in cave-sitdowns" do not occur. Research was undertaken by Premier Mine personnel into aspects of cave mining prior to the implementation of a panel retreat cave in the BA 5 mining block. This included visits to cave mines using LHD's for extraction {{in other areas of the}} world. Problems after initial implementation of the BA 5 cave forced further investigations by the Geotechnical Department. Premier Diamond Mine had experienced problems in predicting the area that would need to be undercut to induce continuous caving in caves above the gabbro siII. D. H. Laubscher's correlation of Mining Rock Mass Rating with hydraulic radius was found to be the most accurate method of predicting the area that needs to be undercut to induce continuous caving. An expert system to predict the fragmentation that will result as ore caves and moves through the draw coIumn to drawpoints below was developed and successfully calibrated at Premier Diamond Mine. Prediction of the fragmentation size distribution and hangup frequency have been used to plan several aspects of cave mining.

40|$|The <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> {{method is}} the most common {{underground}} extractive technique used in Australian metalliferous mines. The crown pillar as it stands in the vertical plane between two open stopes {{is an integral part of}} the global stability of an underground metal mine. The stability of crown pillars are significantly affected by the mechanical and physical properties of the rock mass, structural weaknesses, the initial state of the horizontal stress and the geometry of the crown pillar. To date no integrated design methodology is available in the public domain and generally crown pillar design relies on past experience and rule of thumb. In this thesis the objective was to develop a method which will aid engineers in designing the optimum crown pillar at any mine no matter what the local conditions. T o achieve this objective various methods, including empirical, numerical and theoretical methods of crown pillar design were investigated. This part of the study was used as a guide-line for modification of the available techniques and development of a complete design method for crown pillars. In chapter 3 the voussoir beam and tributary area theories were modified. Using the modified versions a combined empirical and theoretical method of crown pillar design was developed. This method allows the engineer to determine an initial value for pillar span and thickness for the given conditions, and also to get a first estimate of the stress level in the pillar. Also in this chapter is a review of the work on stope design of Mathews et al (1981) and Potvin et al (1989). Finally a preliminary design methodology is presented. Chapter 4 has two basic sections dealing with the techniques used for gathering and reducing field and laboratory data essential for design. The first section deals with the techniques, such as scanline surveying, used in the Held to determine the structure of a rock mass. The second describes the various tests which were conducted to determine the mechanical properties of the rock mass. Crown pillar stability assessment based on data collected from case studies of a copper mine (CSA Mine, Cobar) and a lead-zinc mine (NBHC Mine), was carried out in chapters five and six. CSA Mine, NSW, Australia was chosen as the first site for evaluation of the stability of crown pillars. Cobar is a copper mine where open stoping operations are carried out in several parallel orcbodies which dip between 752 ̆ 2 to 85 ° and have an average thickness of 12 m. The NBHC Mine, Broken Hill, NSW, Australia was the second mine chosen for a crown pillar case study. In this mine the orebody has been formed from several massive and thick discrete lodes or lenses. The geometries of the stopes and crown pillars are much more complicated than at CSA Mine and the stress distribution due to mining activities is also complex. The crown pillar span varies from one area to another; this variation being influenced by the grade of ore and the geometry of the orebody The results from the joint surveys and rock tests were used as data in order to determine the applicability of the various design methods and back analyse stable and failed pillars in these mines. Part of the back analysis included the use of UDEC (a distinct element program) to simulate the action of the crown pillars under various stress regimes and various mining sequences. To gain a better understanding of the failure mechanism and modelling capabilities of UDEC, a series of parametric studies were also carried out. Finally, after comparing the different methods, conclusions are drawn and a methodology for crown pillar design is suggested and recommendations for future work are given...|$|E

40|$|The steeply dipping vein orebody of Bousquet 2 mine is {{extracted}} by sublevel <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> method. The presence of structural discontinuities, high induced stress distribution, and narrow stope widths are major factors which can seriously affect ore dilution. Therefore, strict ore dilution control {{is necessary in}} order to keep the mine competitive. The thesis describes the selective mining method adapted to this type of orebody, and subsequent measures taken to minimize ore dilution. For this study, the locations of stress relaxation are taken as failures zones. Therefore, these zones are more important since they are subjected to very low stresses which can provoke rock block sliding or local wall caving (tension failure). Tracing the zone of tensile stress in the stope wall gives reasonable prediction of dilution and permits to calibrate the numerical model using the field data obtained from the cavity Monitoring System (CMS). <b>Stope</b> <b>mining</b> is made in several cuts according to the width of the ore zone. For an improved recovery, some <b>stopes</b> are <b>mined</b> using primary and secondary stoping. Blasthole pattern and mining sequences are closely linked to the ore zone configuration. The main causes of ore dilution are summarized. They are a combination of several factors such as ground conditions, blasting damage, state of stresses around the stope, and stope design. In order to minimize ore dilution from hanging-wall and foot-wall, cable support is installed. Numerical modelling is carried out for a typical cable bolt pattern. The results of modelling have demonstrated that the cable bolts were necessary to control hanging wall caving. This is accompanied by a reduction of ore dilution. Consequently the study has shown the effectiveness of cables bolt as pre-support of the schistose walls in Bousquet sublevel stoping environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop an {{appropriate}} mine design, {{a thorough understanding of}} the rock mass conditions and its potential response to mining is required. Rock mass characterisation is a key component in developing models of the rock mass and its engineering behaviour, and relies on disparate data collected by exploration geologists, mine geologists, rock mechanics engineers and technicians, in a variety of formats. Optimal rock mass model development requires the effective integration of all data sources, which currently requires considerable effort in collecting, managing, collating, validating and analysing this data. The importance of understanding the spatial variability of rock mass conditions has been highlighted as a major issue. The traditional approach of using simplistic models of “average” rock mass conditions can lead to sub-optimal designs, which may result in unplanned additional costs or economic implications of dilution and ore loss. The design of stope and pillars should be optimised for the prevailing rock mass conditions in the various regions of the mine. Some of the existing design tools used for open stope design have shown poor reliability in their performance predictions. Though some may have been originally developed to assist in initial stope size selection (i. e. pre-feasibility and feasibility levels), they are potentially being inappropriately relied upon for detailed design. Consideration of large scale structures on stability and their influence on local rock mass conditions are also important aspects of open stope design that are commonly over-looked. There is a need to select design methodologies that are optimised for the stage of project development. It is also important to emphasise the iterative, evolutionary and interdisciplinary nature of open stope design. This thesis proposes a framework that attempts to integrate different rock mass characterisation models, numerical modelling and stope performance data to assist in improving the overall excavation design process. The key philosophy behind design optimisation is the continual reduction in uncertainty in collected data, analysis and design methods used with a view to improving the overall reliability of the design. A stope span design optimisation approach is proposed which attempts to ensure that the appropriate methodologies in data collection, data analysis, rock mass model formulation and stope design are utilised at relevant project stages in order to minimise uncertainty and maximise design reliability. The design optimisation approach recognises that the appropriateness of a particular design methodology is highly dependant on the availability of an appropriate rock mass model, which is in turn dependant on the availability of quality rock mass data. With respect to the design of spans in <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> <b>mining,</b> the key aims of the proposed integrated approach are to; • Assess the suitability of data for analysis • If data is unsuitable, assess the most appropriate data collection strategy • Assess the most appropriate approach to rock mass modelling • Assess the most appropriate design methodologies • Assess the reliability of the design criteria and quantify the potential economic impact of the design on the projectOptimisation of the design process also requires integration of state-of-the-art techniques in data collection, analysis, modelling and engineering analysis and design at the appropriate stage of project development. During development of this thesis a number of improvements have been proposed in key areas in the rock engineering design process which can be incorporated into the integrated approach, including; • A rock mass data model has been developed that assists in facilitating the ongoing rock mass characterisation process. The data model is capable of integrating rock mass data from various sources, which promotes sharing of data and avoids duplication of data collection efforts. The data model is able to query rock mass data, define relationships between data types, apply bias corrections, and perform basic analysis for use in subsequent detailed analysis and rock mass modelling. • An implicit based approach to spatial rock mass and deterministic discontinuity modelling can be employed to improve understanding of the spatial variability of rock mass parameters, inter-relationships between rock mass characteristics on their role in design. For example, understanding the influence of large-scale structures on rock mass characteristics and excavation performance. • Improved scale independent geometrical assessments of stope performance have been proposed that maximise the use of stope performance data. • An integrated back analysis framework has been presented that is able to account for structural complexity, scale and features that cannot be directly incorporated into linear elastic numerical modelling codes. • With regard to linear elastic back analyses, an number of improvements have been proposed, as well as a suggested method to assess appropriateness of continuum models based on discontinuity intensity and critical span...|$|E

2500|$|The stope, {{which is}} the {{workshop}} of the mine, is the excavation from which the ore is extracted. Two methods of <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> are commonly used. In the [...] "cut and fill" [...] or open stoping method, the space remaining following removal of ore after blasting is filled with waste rock and cement. In the [...] "shrinkage" [...] method, only sufficient broken ore is removed via the chutes below to allow miners working {{from the top of}} the pile to drill and blast the next layer to be broken off, eventually leaving a large hole. Another method, known as room and pillar, is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for roof support.|$|R

The underground operation used the square set mining method, but by 1901 had converted to an <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> and pillar method with considerable cost savings. The operation maintained a completely unsupported [...] "show stope" [...] with dimensions of 80 ft high, 105 ft wide, and 400 ft long. In 1903 the mine operated three small steam shovels {{to work in}} the surface operations producing half of the mine's production, making this one of the earliest attempts at open-pit mining in the British Columbia. Ore was transported to the smelter via the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had built a line to the mining operation by the time the smelter was completed in 1900.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{methods of}} {{analysis}} such as the finite element method and finite difference method have seen increasing use {{in recent years as}} tools for geomechanical mine design to predict problems of ground caving and failure. As a result of recent advances in computer technology, it is now possible to handle large-scale problems involving complex material and geometric nonlinearities at an affordable computational cost. The scope of this study is the stability of underground mine haulage drifts associated with sublevel stoping method with delayed backfill. This {{is one of the most}} popular mining methods today in Canadian underground metal mines. In this method, blasted ore is mucked with load-haul-dump vehicles and transported to the nearest dump through a nearby haulage drift. Therefore, it is crucial in a mining operation that a haulage drift remains functional during the life of the stope. This study is focused on studying the interaction between the haulage drift and nearby mining activity. The stability of the haulage drift is examined through a detailed parametric study of a finite element model representing typical mining layout most commonly adopted in Canadian underground metal mines. The model parametric study examines the influence of critical factors such as the <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> sequences, mining depth and the distance between the stope and the haulage drift. The model is set up for nonlinear behaviour of the rock mass taking into account elastoplasticity of the rock mass and non-associated plasticity using Mohr Coulomb and Drucker Prager yield functions. Stability indicators are defined in terms of displacement, stress and the extent of yield zones. These indicators serve as a basis for assessing the effect of different parameters on the stability of the haulage drift. From the model parametric study, it is found that <b>stope</b> <b>mining</b> causes a lateral movement of the entire drift. The severity of such movement is increased with shorter distance between the stope and haulage drift. Of all mining sequences examined, same-level mining is the most critical step. It is also found that more yield zones develop around the haulage drift as the mining depth increases and as distance between haulage drift and the stope decreases. A 3 -centre arc drift is compared with a rectangular one of the same cross sectional area. It is found that the 3 -centre arc drift shape is more stable. This study also demonstrates that the nonlinear elastoplastic analysis gives more realistic results than traditional linear elastic analysis in terms of stress and displacement behaviour of the haulage drift...|$|R

In this study, a mathematical expression to simulate the vertical stress variation is developed using the experimental shear stress data of granular backfill. The developed model is validated against average vertical stress measured in the experiment. Therefore, the developed model {{has the advantage of}} determining both the average vertical stress and its distribution respectively, at a particular depth and a cross sectional area of the <b>mine</b> <b>stope...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new methods}} to improve <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> hangingwall (HW) design based on knowledge gained from site visits, observations, and data collection at underground mines in Canada, Australia, and Kazakhstan. The data for analysis was collected during 2 months {{of research at the}} Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Ltd. Callinan Mine in Flin Flon, Manitoba, a few trips to the Cameco Rabbit Lake mine in northern Saskatchewan, and 3 years of research and employment at the Xstrata Zinc George Fisher mine near Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. Other sites visited, where substantial stope stability knowledge was accessed include the Inco Thompson mines in northern Manitoba; BHP Cannington mine, Xstrata Zinc Lead Mine, and Xstrata Copper Enterprise Mine, in Queensland, Australia; and the Kazzinc Maleevskiy Mine in north-eastern Kazakhstan. An improved understanding of stability and design of <b>open</b> <b>stope</b> HWs was developed based on: 1) 	Three years of data collection from various rock masses and mining geometries to develop new sets of design lines for an existing HW stability assessment method; 2) 	The consideration of various scales of domains to examine HW rock mass behaviour and development of a new HW stability assessment method; 3) 	The investigation of the HW failure mechanism using analytical and numerical methods; 4) 	An examination of the effects of stress, undercutting, faulting, and time on stope HW stability through the presentation of observations and case histories; and 5) 	Innovative stope design techniques to manage predicted stope HW instability. An observational approach was used for the formulation of the new stope design methodology. To improve mine performance by reducing and/or controlling the HW rock from diluting the ore with non-economic material, the individual stope design methodology included creating vertical HWs, leaving ore skins or chocks where appropriate, and rock mass management. The work contributed to a reduction in annual dilution from 14. 4 % (2003) to 6. 3 % (2005), an increase in zinc grade from 7. 4 % to 8. 7 %, and increasing production tonnes from 2. 1 to 2. 6 Mt (Capes et al., 2006) ...|$|R
