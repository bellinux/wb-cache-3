5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; there is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend {{to suffer from}} poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E
5|$|Oxelösund is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{municipality}} {{emerging from}} a split between two cities – in this case, Nyköping and Oxelösund, which are now in neighboring municipalities since the splitting of Nikolai rural municipality in 1950. The town of Oxelösund was established in 1900 and became a city in 1950, when it became a separate municipality from Nyköping.|$|E

This device, displaying a hydrocarbon molecule, alludes to the area's petrochemical industry, and is also an example of distinctly modern arms. The arms, registered with the PRV in 1977, display: Argent, a hydrocarbon molecule of three pellets conjoined with six bezants gules, over a base wavy azure.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{throughout}} the film studios and movie sets will help Seymour on his quest with new objects and advice, {{but only if}} he helps them first. Seymour's observations when collecting objects and sarcastic exchanges with other characters are communicated through speech bubbles. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> puzzle is the Frankenstein's monster which must be created by combining body parts in a specific location on the horror film set. Once the monster is completed it smashes {{through one of the}} set's walls, allowing Seymour to access the set next door.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet there is at least <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E

5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|E
5|$|The Ebionite gospel is <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> type of gospel harmony {{that used}} the Gospel of Matthew {{as a base}} text but {{did not include the}} Gospel of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the Gospel of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E

5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. <b>One</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just <b>one</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E
