40|$|The paper {{presents}} QCAMP, a cube-based algorithm for minimization {{of single}} Boolean functions. The algorithm does not generate all the prime cubes, {{nor does it}} require the <b>Off-set</b> <b>of</b> the function. Two significant contributions of QCAMP are the UNATE TEST which tests if a given function is a unate function, and the BISECT procedure which minimizes a cyclic function without taking recourse to branching. A well known property of a unate function is that the prime cubes subsuming a unate function are all essential prime cubes. Hence {{as soon as a}} function passes the UNATE TEST, all its prime cubes are recognized as solution cubes without any further processing. Many special functions, such as both the On and <b>Off-sets</b> <b>of</b> Achilles' heel functions which ESPRESSO II finds hard to minimize are also unate functions. Consequently, as will be evident from the computational results QCAMP exhibits far better performance compared to ESPRESSO II in all such and many other functions...|$|R

L-neurones generated action potentials, usually once, at the <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> hyperpolariz-ing light responses, or at the termination of hyperpolarizing current stimuli. The action potential was blocked by replacing saline Ca 2 + with Mg 2 + but maintained when Baz+ was substituted. A block was produced by 2 mmoll~ 1 Cdz+ or ZOmmoll" 1 Co 2 +.

30|$|Photoluminescence {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} to investigate the optical properties of antimonide NWs. Band gap of antimonide NWs corresponds to bulk of semiconductor materials while ZB phase dominate in their crystalline structure. Infrared optical absorption spectroscopy revealed the band gap of InSb NW arrays. These NWs with a radius of 40  nm revealed a detection edge of about 170  meV whereas higher edge of 200  meV is observed for those NWs having diameter 60  nm [62]. These decreases in diameters exhibit a blue shift that was attributed to confinement effects. Existence of a lot number of heterojunction in the NW geometry were due to the relaxed constraint of lattice matching, and material integrations such as InAs/InSb, InAs/GaInAs/GaSb, InAs/GaSb, InAs/InP/InSb, and NWs {{that have already been}} developed. Bulk synthesis of InSb/InAs heterojunction NWs and related material combinations is difficult. During fabrication of heterojunctions in NWs, band alignment can be changed due to change in phase for example in InAs NWs both ZB and WZ phases are equally possible. Another unique type of heterostructures is created during growth of ZB InAs 0.9 Sb 0.1 on GaSb substrate [160]. During growth of InAsSb NWs, antimony has been incorporated from substrate which may affect electrical properties. Theoretical approximations, for InAsSb NWs, the band structure proposed show a valence band <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> about 495  meV with a band gap of 270  meV [161], while the experimental observations in this <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> energy is quite different, which is impossible to measure due to transport mechanism at low source-drain bias.|$|R
40|$|Background: Classic work on visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) suggests that people store {{a limited amount}} of items for subsequent report. However, when human observers are cued to shift attention to one item in VSTM during retention, it seems as if there is a much larger representation, which keeps additional items in a more fragile VSTM store. Thus far, {{it is not clear whether}} the capacity of this fragile VSTM store indeed exceeds the traditional capacity limits of VSTM. The current experiments address this issue and explore the capacity, stability, and duration of fragile VSTM representations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We presented cues in a change-detection task either just after <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> the memory array (iconic-cue), 1, 000 ms after <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> the memory array (retro-cue) or after on-set of the probe array (post-cue). We observed three stages in visual information processing 1) iconic memory with unlimited capacity, 2) a four seconds lasting fragile VSTM store with a capacity that is at least a factor of two higher than 3) the robust and capacity-limited form of VSTM. Iconic memory seemed to depend on the strength of the positive after-image resulting from the memory display and was virtually absent under conditions of isoluminance or when intervening light masks were presented. This suggests that iconic memory is driven by prolonged retinal activation beyond stimulus duration. Fragile VSTM representations were not affected by light masks, but were completely overwritten by irrelevant pattern masks that spatially overlapped the memory array. Conclusions/Significance: We find that immediately after a stimulus has disappeared from view, subjects can still acces...|$|R

The advantage of the dual-source dual-energy CT approach is that the tube current can be adjusted for each kVp level separately, resulting in similar noise levels of the two datasets. Due to the angular <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> the tube-detector combinations, dual-energy processing has to be performed in the image space.|$|R

Geometrical positioning of the artificial joint should restore correct motion and adequate leverage of the surrounding muscles in order to exert the appropriate functional joint moments.

Pressure lamellae represent the first stage of deformation in the region, while the second stage of deformation is represented by curved pressure lamellae and annealing texture, and the third stage of deformation is characterised by truncation and offset of pressure lamellae. The deformations probably occurred at temperatures reaching 180 °C and at pressures about 0. 2 MPa. Geological evidence supports that the first phase of deformation is explained by the southward thrusting of the Niğde Massif over the Ulukışla Basin.

The lightest, secondary black hole is active, and gas orbiting around it is responsible for the blue-shifted broad emission lines with velocity <b>off-set</b> <b>of</b> 2650 km/s, relative to the galaxy rest frame. As the tidal interaction of the binary with the outer disc is expected to excavate a gap, the blue-shifted narrow emission lines are consistent with being emitted from the low-density inhomogeneous gas of the hollow region. From the observations we infer a binary mass ratio q ~ 0. 3, a mass for the primary of M 1 ~ 2 billion Msun and a semi-major axis of 0. 34 pc, corresponding to an orbital period of 370 years. We use the results of cosmological merger trees to estimate the likely-hood of observing SDSSJ 092712. 65 + 294344. 0 as recoiling black hole or as a binary.
