5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> {{in favor}} of the {{construction}} of I-68 was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland. The economy of the surrounding area has improved since the construction of the freeway, especially in Garrett County, where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Correspondingly, Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after the construction of the road, with full- and part-time employment increasing from 8,868 in 1976 to 15,334 in 1991. However, economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties. There were concerns over loss of customers to businesses that have been cut off from the main highway due to the construction of the new alignment in the 1980s, leading to protests when then-Governor Harry Hughes visited the Sideling Hill road cut when it was opened.|$|E
5|$|Perturbed {{by those}} who betrayed fellow members to the French and the {{problems}} this behaviour caused, Học convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid-1929 at the village of Lac Dao, along the Gia Lam–Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Học argued for a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Học's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in {{an attack on the}} two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin, because the party was weak elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

25|$|The first {{suggestion}} that a military force {{should be sent}} to the Yukon came from Nathaniel Wallace, who put forward the idea in Parliament in February 1898. The government worked up the proposal into a formal plan, which was confirmed through an Order-in-Council on March 21. In May, Frederick Borden, the Minister of Militia and Defence, announced that a 200-strong force would be deployed to Fort Selkirk, the nominal capital of the territory, to reinforce the mounted police. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> put forward in favour of this option was that it was much cheaper than sending additional police, who enjoyed higher pay than soldiers. In addition to its primary role in maintaining Canadian sovereignty, Borden stated that the force would, if necessary, assist in maintaining law and order.|$|E
25|$|On October 8, 2008 Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko {{tried to}} {{dissolve}} the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) and called early parliamentary elections in Ukraine {{for the second time}} in as many years for December 7, 2008. The right of the President to dismiss the parliament was challenged in Ukraine's Constitutional Court. The President's decree has since lapsed as it was never put into action (the coalition supporting the second Tymoshenko Government was extended) and appeals to Ukraine's Constitutional Court were withdrawn. Nevertheless, a snap election was predicted by Ukrainian politicians during the 2010 presidential election and after the dismissal of the second Tymoshenko Government. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> against holding early elections were the costs. Early elections were (in October 2008) estimated to cost approximately UAH₴417 million (about EUR€60 million or US$80 million).|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.|$|E

25|$|In this schema, {{three main}} {{prerequisites}} are posited for globalization to occur. The {{first is the}} idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with interdependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.|$|E
