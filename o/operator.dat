5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} <b>operator</b> chose the message setting KYG for a message. The <b>operator</b> would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that {{particular}} day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the <b>operator</b> would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The <b>operator</b> would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving <b>operator</b> could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
