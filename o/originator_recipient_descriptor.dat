These requirements are to be incorporated into mechanisms performing formal access control and in applying classification, category, and dissemination control marking phrases to messages, as appropriate. The proper implementation of these requirements is intended to provide interoperability with respect to security classifications and categories of DMS GENSER messaging, GENSER messaging current practices, and with the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) system and its users. Included are requirements for interoperability with Allied and NATO <b>originators</b> and <b>recipients.</b> These requirements are derived from known public law and other authoritative sources presently in force. Some caveats and markings based outside of GENSER and used in AUTODIN by the GENSER community are included to provide a seamless transition to DMS messaging. 1. 2 Message SECURITY Labels 1 and User authorizations This document does not specify implementation.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of knowledge generates positive externalities if knowledge flows increase {{the productivity of}} Research and Development (R&D) by the recipients of these flows. This paper investigates {{the extent to which}} this positive spillover effect of knowledge diffusion depends on the similarity of research activities by the <b>originator</b> and <b>recipient</b> of the knowledge. The paper also investigates at what rate these spillover effects diminish as the distance between the <b>originator</b> and <b>recipient</b> increases. We find, using regional patent and R&D expenditure data from the European Union, that similarity between R&D activities is not only statistically significant, but salient: regions with completely dissimilar R&D activities exhibit essentially no spillovers at all. We also find an increase in the distance between the originating and recipient region by 550 kilometres reduces spillovers by 75 % (as low as 55 % in some specifications). Unlike much of the extant literature, the rate of spatial decay of spillovers is estimated jointly with the remaining parameters of the model rather than through specification searches over a set of alternative weight matrices. Our results are robust to the inclusion of unobserved country effects and border barriers. ...|$|R

5000|$|Electronic data {{interchange}} (EDI) is {{an electronic}} communication method that provides standards for exchanging data via any electronic means. By {{adhering to the}} same standard, two different companies or organizations, even in two different countries, can electronically exchange documents (such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and many others). EDI has existed for more than 30 years, {{and there are many}} EDI standards (including X12, EDIFACT, ODETTE, etc.), some of which address the needs of specific industries or regions. It also refers specifically to a family of standards.In 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defined electronic data interchange as [...] "the computer-to-computer interchange of strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments. EDI implies a sequence of messages between two parties, either of whom may serve as <b>originator</b> or <b>recipient.</b> The formatted data representing the documents may be transmitted from <b>originator</b> to <b>recipient</b> via telecommunications or physically transported on electronic storage media." [...] It distinguishes mere electronic communication or data exchange, specifying that [...] "in EDI, the usual processing of received messages is by computer only. Human intervention in the processing of a received message is typically intended only for error conditions, for quality review, and for special situations. For example, the transmission of binary or textual data is not EDI as defined here unless the data are treated as one or more data elements of an EDI message and are not normally intended for human interpretation as part of online data processing.EDI can be formally defined as the transfer of structured data, by agreed message standards, from one computer system to another without human intervention.|$|R
50|$|In cryptography, {{encryption}} is {{the process}} of encoding a message or information {{in such a way that}} only authorized parties can access it. Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm, generating ciphertext that can only be read if decrypted. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the <b>originator</b> to <b>recipients</b> but not to unauthorized users.|$|R

40|$|Information-security {{technologies}} are often implemented with redundant data fields attached to message containers. In a Key Recovery System that employs public key cryptography, a data recovery field (DRF) {{attached to a}} message typically contains a session key encrypted with a Key Recovery Agent’s public key. At a later time when needs arise, the session key can be retrieved from DRF and used to recover the original message without {{the involvement of the}} message <b>originator</b> or <b>recipient.</b> Two problems with such a system are (1) that DRF is at least as long as the public modulo of the Key Recovery Agent, which represents an increasingly large communication overhead, (2) and that DRF is not created in an authenticated way, which opens a door for an originator to create a bogus DRF and deny his/her act at a later time. The main purposes of this paper are to address the two problems and exhibit a possible solution to them. In particular, we propose an authenticated Key Recovery System using a recently discovered signcryption primitive that combines the functions of digital signature with those of public-key encryption. We also carry out a detailed comparison between our proposal and existing Key Recovery Systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{explosive}} growth of electronic businesses carried on the Internet, nonrepudiation services {{turn out to be}} increasingly important. Non-repudiation services protect the transacting parties against any false denial that a particular event or action has taken place, in which evidence will be generated, collected and maintained to enable the settlement of disputes. Several fair non-repudiation protocols have been proposed, which support non-repudiation of origin and non-repudiation of receipt while neither the <b>originator</b> nor the <b>recipient</b> can gain an advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving during a transaction. However, a critical issue on how to maintain the validity of non-repudiation evidence efficiently during and after a transaction was not considered.

40|$|We {{deal with}} two claws of Zhou-Gollmann's fair nonrepudiation {{protocol}}. Firstly, their protocol divides a message into 2 parts, i. e., a key K and a ciphertext C. Then, C is {{delivered to the}} recipient, while K is submitted to TTP (Trusted Third Party). If the originator doesn't submit K to TTP, then the protocol appears to have no dispute between the <b>originator</b> and the <b>recipient.</b> However, the protocol depends on his action on whether the originator really submits K to TTP or not. We show that the originator can make the protocol unfair by using his advantageous position, and present how to improve {{the fairness of the}} protocol. Secondly, the protocol doesn't provide the message privacy. This means that additional protocols are required to transfer an important message in private. We propose an improved version of the protocol to guarantee the message privacy. 1.

40|$|A {{method for}} disguising {{information}} so that ideally it cannot {{be understood by}} anyone but the intended recipient is called a cipher. Cryptanalysis refers {{to the process of}} an unintended recipient of disguised information attempting to remove the disguise and understand the information, and successful cryptanalysis is called breaking a cipher. When a cipher is used to exchange information, the undisguised information is called the plaintext, and the disguised information the ciphertext. The process of converting from plaintext to ciphertext is called encryption. Upon receiving a ciphertext, the recipient must remove the disguise, a process called decryption. To be able to effectively encrypt and decrypt messages, correspondents must typically share knowledge of a secret key, which is used in applying the cipher. More specifically, the key for a cipher is information usually known only to the <b>originator</b> and intended <b>recipient</b> of a message, which is used by the originator to encrypt the plaintext, and the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext.
