40|$|A {{study was}} made of assimilates and ionic tracer movementalong the stolon of Saxifraga sarmentosa. When ionic tracers or 14 C-sucrose are applied to the transloadting stolon they undergo a longdistance {{transport}} which is strictly polarised, with a short-distance movement which is symmetrical {{with respect to the}} point of application. The distribution along the axis after a suitable length of time shows an accurate exponential fall-off pattern, except with naturally assimilated or applied 14 C-sucrose where it is fairly level. In this case the linear velocity of movement was estimated as about 20 cm h - 1. Transport of materials is readily reversible by interchanging the roles of parent and daughter plants as source and sink. The transpiration stream can be similarly reversed. By these means it was confirmed that 14 C-assimilates and 137 Cs move in the phloem, whereas 89 Sr moves in the xylem. The sieve tubes are thus not inherently polarised in this organ. Inhibitors such as nitrogen, cyanide and DNP applied <b>overlengths</b> of 20 [...] 30 cm exert a more or less complete and reversible inhibition of the movement of 14 C-assimilates and 137 Cs. Cyanide gas is considerably more effective than solution. A variety of approaches, including the use of 14 C-cyanide, confirmed that the inhibition was effective in the sieve tubes themselves, and not merely at the terminal sites. Electron microscopic examination showed that callosing in the sieve plates was not involved; however, in all cases, including the normal one, the sieve plate pores appeared blocked with P-protein. Tests with Valinonycin which possesses a particular affinity for potassium, were ineffective. This may have been due to its insolubility in water and to the large size of the molecule. Comparative studies were carried out by applying two ionic tracers together. These gave consistent and precise results in termsof the slopes of the plots log activity against distance Of the tracers used (22 Na, 42 K, 86 Rb, 137 Cs and 82 Br) the comparison of 137 Cs and 82 Br was perhaps the most interesting; the anion is transported more or less equally with the cation, but its lateral leakage appears to be less. The results of this study provide a well-established case for the following conclusions relevant to the controversy over mechanism: (1) Phloem transport in the stolon is strictly unidirectional. (2) Nitrogen, Cyanide and DNP exert a strong effect localised in the sieve tubes themselves (as well as at the terminals); it is reversible. (3) The inhibition of transport is not due to callose blockage. (4.) Anion transport follows a similar pattern to cation. These conclusions are very adverse to the Munch hypothesis, and to any diffusion-analogue theory; they favour a theory of activemass flow. The electro-osmotic theory faces the difficulty of anion transport. <p...|$|R

50|$|The unfortunate part of {{this plan}} was that as the {{measurement}} {{did not take place}} until Schreiber, the Train Dispatcher worked the 126 miles of the Nipigon Subdivision with no accurate train measurement for Eastward trains. A very crude method of determining such train length on the Nipigon Subdivision was developed using the features of the CTC panel. If, while en route, an eastward freight train showed on the CTC panel as occupying both the east and west switches of a siding at the same time, then, knowing the length of that siding, it could be assumed that this train would be <b>overlength</b> for a siding of similar size. This was a very primitive and potentially inaccurate methodology as it was dependent upon the quickness of the CTC electric signal relays to indicate such occupancy on the dispatcher's CTC panel. If there were other train activities occurring at the same time, the reaction time of the relays could be delayed and an occupancy displayed briefly when there was no such occupancy.|$|E
50|$|The first {{element of}} {{controlling}} train lengths was {{to place a}} cap on train size. To avoid train meets where both trains were <b>overlength</b> for a siding’s capacity, an instruction was issued to the Thunder Bay yardmasters to ensure that eastward trains leaving their terminal for the Nipigon Subdivision did not exceed a length of 6200 feet. This capping {{of the length of}} eastward trains also tacitly acknowledged that westward trains would have no length restrictions. When first implemented, this length target was difficult to meet as there was no process in place to deliver an accurate train length measurement. Thus sometimes there were surprises when, on a planned meet, a train did not fit into a siding. In such instances, the excess length would have to be moved into the siding’s back track, if possible, until the opposing train had passed. Under such a scenario, delays could be incurred by both trains. Canadian Pacific Railway took train length determination a step further and implemented on the Division a basic process to capture actual train lengths and pass this information along to the train dispatcher to assist in train planning while limiting train delays.|$|E

All of the persistent chimeric genomes contained the preC region and the part of the C region encoding the N-terminal 1 – 145 amino acids of the WHV genome.

The wildtype gene {{was shown to}} specify two forms of /Ilactamase which differ in molecular weight by about 2500 daltons. This difference is consistent with removal, predicted on other grounds, of 23 aminoterminal residues (the “signal ” sequence). All b/amutants, including chain-terminating mutants lacking as much as 50 % or as little as 10 % of the protein, were apparently unaffected in this processing step.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{injection}} (HI) with a replication competent hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome {{may lead}} to transient or prolonged HBV replication in mice. However, the prolonged HBV persistence after HI depends on the specific backbone of the vector carrying HBV genome and the genetic background of the mouse strain. We asked whether a genetically closely related hepadnavirus, woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), may maintain the gene expression and replication in the mouse liver after HI. Interestingly, we found that HI of pBS-WHV 1. 3 containing a 1. 3 fold <b>overlength</b> WHV genome in BALB/c mouse led to the long presence of WHV DNA and WHV proteins expression in the mouse liver. Thus, we asked whether WHV genome carrying foreign DNA sequences could maintain the long term gene expression and persistence. For this purpose, the coding region of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was inserted into the WHV genome to replace the corresponding region. Three recombinant WHV-HBV genomes were constructed with the replacement with HBsAg a-determinant, major HBsAg, and middle HBsAg. Serum HBsAg, viral DNA, hepatic WHV protein expression, and viral replication intermediates were detected in mice after HI with recombinant genomes. Similarly, the recombinant genomes could persist for a prolonged period of time up to 45 weeks in mice.

40|$|Background. Multiple {{cartilaginous}} exostoses cause various deformities of the epiphysis. In exostoses of the ulna, the ulna is shortened and {{the radius}} acquires varus deformity, which {{may lead to}} dislocation of the radial head. In this study, we present the results of exostoses resection, with correction and lengthening with external fixators for functional and cosmetic improvement, and prevention of radial head dislocation. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed seven forearms of seven patients who had deformities of the forearm associated with multiple cartilaginous exostoses. One patient had dislocation of the radial head. Operative technique was excision of osteochondromas from the distal ulna, correction of the radius, and ulnar lengthening with external fixation up to 5 mm plus variance. We evaluated radiographs {{and the range of}} pronation and supination. Furthermore, we conducted a follow-up of ulnar length after the operation. Results. Dislocation of the radial head of one patient was naturally reduced without any operative intervention. At the most recent follow-up, six of the seven patients showed full improvement in pronation-supination. Ulnar shortening recurred with skeletal growth of four skeletally immature patients; however, it did not recur in one skeletally mature patient. <b>Overlength</b> of 5 mm was negated by the recurrence of ulnar shortening about 1. 5 years after the operation. Conclusions. We treated seven forearms of seven patients by excision of osteochondromas, correction of radii, and gradual lengthening of ulnas with external fixators. The results of the procedure were satisfactory, especially for function of the elbow and wrist. However, we must consider the possible recurrence of ulnar shortening within about 1. 5 years during skeletal growth periods in immature patients. © 2006 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association...|$|E
40|$|Woodchuck {{hepatitis}} virus (WHV) enhancer II (EnII) {{is located}} upstream {{of the major}} pregenomic RNA promoter and is thought {{to play an important}} role in the insertional activation of the N-myc 2 gene during WHV hepatocarcinogenesis. WHV EnII is recognized by at least three host transcription factors: HNF- 1, HNF- 4, and Oct- 1. Here, the roles of these EnII-binding factors in viral transcription and replication have been further examined. In HepG 2 cells transiently transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene whose expression is dependent upon EnII, mutations in either the HNF- 1 or the HNF- 4 site strongly reduced CAT activity, while ablation of the Oct- 1 site decreased CAT expression only twofold. Mutations in more than one site completely abolished reporter expression. These same mutations were also tested in an <b>overlength</b> WHV genome for their impact on viral replication and gene expression. In transfected HepG 2 cells, lesions in the HNF- 1 site inactivated pregenomic RNA expression and viral reverse transcription, with only minimal effects on the expression of other viral mRNAs. By contrast, Oct- 1 site lesions had no effect on either viral RNA synthesis or DNA replication, and HNF- 4 site lesions produced a modest reduction of pregenomic RNA but had no impact on viral DNA synthesis. Testing of the mutants in susceptible woodchucks revealed that, as expected, viruses with lesions in the HNF- 1 site were nearly noninfectious, while mutants with lesions at the Oct- 1 site were fully replication competent. HNF- 4 site mutants were replication competent but may display reduced levels of replication in the intact animal host. We conclude that (i) EnII is primarily devoted to the regulation of pregenomic RNA in WHV, (ii) HNF- 1 is essential for EnII function in vivo, and (iii) HNF- 4 plays a demonstrable but adjunctive role in EnII function...|$|E
40|$|Background & {{objectives}} : Non-detection {{of hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) envelope protein (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) in a chronically HBV infected individual {{has been described}} as occult infection. One possible reason for this phenotype is alteration in large (L-HBsAg) to small (S-HBsAg) envelope protein ratio associated with reduced or non secretion of HBsAg. This results in quantitative levels of serum HBsAg below the detection limit of enzyme immunoassays. Genotype D of HBV has a characteristic 33 nucleotide (nt) deletion upstream of the pre-S 2 /S promoter. This deletion may reduce HBsAg secretion in occult infection patients infected with genotype D HBV. Additional deletions in the pre-S 2 /S promoter may further aggravate reduced HBsAg secretion in patients infected with genotype D HBV. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the role of genotype D specific 33 nt deletion and additional pre-S 2 /S promoter deletions in causing reduced or no secretion of HBsAg, in occult infection. Since these deletions overlap virus polymerase, their effect on virus replication was also investigated. Methods : We examined the in vitro expression of HBsAg, ratio of cure and ′e′ antigen (HBcAg/HBeAg), their secretion and virus replication, using <b>overlength</b> 1. 3 mer/ 1. 86 mer genotype A replicons, and genotype D replicons with and without additional pre-S 2 /S promoter deletions from cases of occult infection. Results : Genotype D replicon showed a decrease in HBsAg secretion compared to the wild-type genotype A. Genotype D replicons carrying additional pre-S 2 /S promoter deletions, showed further reduction in HBsAg secretion, demonstrated presence of intracellular HBcAg/HBeAg, virus replication intermediates and ′e′ antigen secretion. Interpretation & conclusions : The characteristic 33 nt deletion of genotype D HBV reduces HBsAg secretion. Additional pre-S 2 /S promoter deletions may further diminish HBsAg secretion, leading to occult infection. Pre-S 2 /S promoter deletions do not affect HBV replication...|$|E

The reason underlying the differences in viral multiplication of the HBV genotypes is unclear, especially in vivo. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the differences in HBV load and the persistence of viremia in vivo between genotypes A and C. Immunodeficient NOG mice were transfected by hydrodynamic injection with the HBV expression plasmids pHBA 1. 2 or pHBC 1. 2, which contain <b>overlength</b> (1. 2 -mer) copies of the genomes of HBV genotype A or C, respectively. One day after transfection, the number of HBcAg-positive hepatocytes and serum HBV DNA levels were similar between mice transfected with pHBA 1. 2 and pHBC 1. 2. Serum levels of HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg in mice transfected with pHBA 1. 2 were maintained over 5 months. In contrast, those in mice with pHBC 1. 2 gradually decreased over time and reached undetectable levels within 3 months after transfection. HBcAg-stained hepatocytes were detected in mice transfected with pHBA 1. 2, but not pHBC 1. 2, 5 months post-transfection. Double-staining immunohistochemistry revealed that the number of cleaved caspase 3 -stained, HBcAg-positive hepatocytes in the pHBC 1. 2 -transfected mice was higher than in the pHBA 1. 2 -transfected mice 3 days post-transfection. Moreover, the plasmid DNA and covalently closed circular DNA levels were decreased in the livers of pHBC 1. 2 -transfected mice. These results suggested that hepatocytes expressing HBV genotype C were eliminated by apoptosis in the absence of immune cells more often than in hepatocytes expressing HBV genotype A. Immunodeficient mice transfected with HBV genotype A develop persistent viremia, whereas those transfected with HBV genotype C exhibit transient viremia accompanied by apoptosis of HBV-expressing hepatocytes.

Gene 5 specifies the major head structural protein; gene 8 specifies the major protein found in infected lysates but not in mature particles. 1 -, 2 - and 3 - lysates accumulate a single distinctive class of particle (L‘proheads”), which are spherical and not full of DNA, but which contain some internal material. Gene I protein is in the mature particle, gene 2 protein is not. Cells infected with mutants of the remaining five genes (10, 26, 16, 20 and 9) accumulate mature length DNA. lo- and 26 - lysates accumulate empty phage heads, but examination of freshly lysed cells shows that many were initially full heads.

Reel LNG is an inshore alternative to the land based infrastructure for distributing LNG. The critical component of the Reel LNG concept is the floating flexible cryogenic pipeline connecting the inshore docking station to the onshore LNG terminal. The system?s interface to the LNGC is a loading-buoy temporarily moored to the ship side with permitted motion in six degrees of freedom. Global dynamic finite element models of floating flexible pipelines have been established {{in order to determine}} the operational performance of the Reel LNG system. Two different flexible pipeline models have been subjected to critical environment conditions. The principal difference between the two case studies is the difference in boundary conditions at the shore-side end-termination. The first pipeline configuration ?Case 1 ? has simply-supported boundary conditions with an imbedded <b>overlength</b> in the pipeline configuration. The risk of pipeline compression is prominent for large offsets of the loading buoy. The second pipeline configuration ?Case 2 ? has a free translational degree of freedom in the direction perpendicular to an ideal straight shoreline. The pipeline is subjected to a constant pre-tension, which implies an onshore tensioner mechanism is required. Results from the global analysis indicate that only Case 2 meets the design requirements related to dynamic behavior. With the specified pre-tension, a maximum relative angle equal to 25 degrees was obtained, resulting in a preliminary minimum bending stiffener length equal to 4. 2 meters. The curvature did not exceed 0. 1 [1 /m] during the length of the analysis. Local stress analyses have been performed in order to establish the fatigue damage accumulation during the lifetime of the flexible pipeline. A simplified approach based on the principle of virtual work is presented. It is assumed that the corrugated pipe is the critical cross-sectional component with respect to fatigue damage accumulation in the flexible pipeline. Only Case 2 is relevant for a fatigue analysis as Case 1 failed to meet the requirements in the global verification process. By application of the Miner-rule, the consummation of fatigue resistance corresponded to five percent of the expected lifetime of the system, which is acceptable according to API standards. </p...|$|E
