After <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Voorhis had the {{advantage}} of incumbency, but this was balanced by other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, he was forced to have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E
5|$|After Delfina {{moved through}} Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter {{provided}} shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents. Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400people. By January27, 12people {{had died from}} the disease. Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45people in the country. Government officials deployed food to the affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges. Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage {{in the weeks after}} it struck. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas.|$|E

5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 21 January 1971, a force of 100 PAVN/Viet Cong commandos {{attacked}} Pochentong airfield, the main base of the Khmer Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This {{may have been a}} blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was largely composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a stroke and was evacuated to Hawaii for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1873 Reitz {{was asked}} to {{represent}} the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly. As so many of Reitz's activities up to that point, his parliamentary career was short-lived. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when another candidate also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E

5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. <b>Only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> earlier.|$|E

Four of the album's tracks had already or would later become singles, although some were limited (promotional) releases and not available commercially. The record also received rave reviews from music critics, who praised the album's musicality and unique lyrical themes. It was ranked at number 500 in the book version of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.|$|E

5|$|The council met on December 14 {{to appoint}} representatives to the Confederacy's unicameral {{provisional}} congress. Those appointed would serve for <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> as the provisional congress {{was replaced with}} a permanent bicameral legislature on February 17, 1862. Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress. The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22. Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions. In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives. One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, {{was elected to the}} Confederate Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising not to talk about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E

5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not address those rumours until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, <b>only</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
