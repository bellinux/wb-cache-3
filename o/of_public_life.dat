5|$|Modern Polish {{literature}} {{begins in}} the 16th century. At that time the Polish language, common to all educated groups, matured and penetrated all areas <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> including municipal institutions, the legal code, the Church and other official uses, coexisting for a while with Latin. Klemens Janicki, one of the Renaissance Latin language poets, a laureate of a papal distinction, was of peasant origin. Another plebeian author, Biernat of Lublin, wrote {{his own version of}} Aesop's fables in Polish, permeated with his socially radical views.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson was {{defeated}} for reelection in 1861.

After the war, he was a delegate to the National Union Party's convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865. He was a supporter of the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{religions}} in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents {{to renounce}} all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant {{they were unable}} to participate in much <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing his}} reelection bid in 1861, Stevenson, a known Confederate sympathizer, stayed out <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> {{during the war}} and was {{consequently}} able to avoid being imprisoned, as many other Confederate sympathizers were. In 1867, just five days after John L. Helm and Stevenson were elected governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, Helm died and Stevenson became acting governor. Stevenson subsequently won a special election in 1868 to finish Helm's term. As governor, he opposed federal intervention in what he considered state matters but insisted that blacks' newly granted rights be observed and used the state militia to quell post-war violence in the state. Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E
5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount {{a run for the}} House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{would prove}} to be a very {{competent}} administrator, with the Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path of discipline and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|Palmyra {{had a large}} agora. However, {{unlike the}} Greek Agoras (public {{gathering}} places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used {{in some of the}} tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes {{was created}} with {{the merger of}} Serbia, Montenegro and the South Slav-inhabited areas of Austria-Hungary on 1 December 1918, in the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was established at war's end to defend the new state. It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army, as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria-Hungary. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From the beginning, much like other aspects <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> in the new kingdom, the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political hegemony.|$|E

5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the {{north-western}} regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that {{were known as}} the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling {{the life of the}} Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.|$|E
5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within {{the ruling party}} structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E
