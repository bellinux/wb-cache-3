5|$|According to the story, unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gift, Norton {{saved the}} cigar, keeping it {{on display in}} his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni {{thought it would be}} a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, but because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine Grade 9 students’ understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science (NoS). There were 37 female and 34 male students participating in {{this research}}, all of which were from an education-extended school in the Chaiyaphum Primary Educational Service Area Office 3, Thailand. <b>The</b> students’ conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science was examined using an open-ended questionnaire about <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science adapted from <b>the</b> one used in Lederman et al. (2002) VNOS-C, and an interview record form. Twenty percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students were randomly selected for an interview to probe deeper into their understanding. The data from the questionnaires and interviews were analyzed base on an interpretive paradigm. Research findings indicated that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students had little awareness, and held naïve views, <b>of</b> all aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science. These findings indicated that <b>the</b> students’ understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science was inadequate and fragmented. An improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students’ understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science is thus necessary...|$|R

Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E

The Vachanamrut is the scripture most commonly used in the Swaminarayan sect. It contains views on dharma (moral conduct), jnana (understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self), vairagya (detachment from material pleasure), and bhakti (pure, selfless devotion to God), the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a jiva (soul) to attain moksha (salvation).|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product.

He would prefer {{to invest in a}} developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} commandos were used mainly as highly trained {{infantry}} units {{for the rest}} of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols. Indicative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00am, as three troops—Nos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops—attacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a diversionary attack from the flank. As soon as the main force left its line of departure it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a diamond-shaped perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on the flank was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the afternoon when it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised.|$|E
5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it {{made it hard to}} find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E

The Yellow Jacket company, with Captain Spier Spencer in command, was posted on the southern end of the camp perimeter. The rest of the militia formed a rectangular formation along the edges of the bluff surrounding the camp. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew commanded the Indiana militia units guarding the steep bluff on the eastern side of the formation. The regulars, commanded by Major Floyd, and the dragoons, commanded by Maj. Joseph Daveiss and former congressman Capt. Benjamin Parke, were kept behind the main line in reserve.|$|E

5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E
