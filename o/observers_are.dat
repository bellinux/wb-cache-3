5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that <b>Observers</b> <b>are</b> time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the case}} of {{observability}} of linear control systems, the design problem of reduced-order state <b>observers</b> <b>is</b> investigated. By using some non-singular linear transformation to the linear system, the corresponding algebraic equivalent system is obtained {{and a part of}} states that needs <b>observering</b> <b>are</b> isolated. Based on the parametric solutions of a Sylvester matrix equation, a parametric expression for all the gain matrices of reduced-order state <b>observers</b> <b>is</b> presented, and a parametric design method of reduced-order state <b>observers</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Finally, a numerical example shows the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed parametric design method for reduced-order state observers in linear systems...|$|R

25|$|Much {{effort has}} been {{dedicated}} to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, <b>observers</b> <b>are</b> presented with two arrays, composed {{of a number of}} stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers is to decide if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Performance is critically dependent on the number of items in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, correct responses invariably decline in a monotonic fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.|$|E
40|$|A new sliding mode <b>observer</b> <b>is</b> {{proposed}} in this paper; {{compared with the}} existing sliding mode observer used for SOC estimation, the new observer has the advantages of simple design and good generality.

Battery test {{was done with the}} simulated FUDS condition, and the robustness of the new <b>observer</b> <b>was</b> verified by the test. Because battery internal ohmic resistance is changing in battery working process, which has a significant effect on SOC estimation, a new double sliding mode <b>observer</b> <b>was</b> designed to identify the internal resistance. The tests results show that the battery internal ohmic resistance changes greatly when the SOC is low and the double observer can accurately identify the resistance which improves the accuracy of the battery model. The results also show that the new double <b>observer</b> <b>is</b> robust and can improve the precision of SOC estimation when the battery remaining capacity is low...|$|R

25|$|Subjective {{estimates}} of an individual's SA {{may also be}} made by experienced observers (e.g., peers, commanders, or trained external experts). These observer ratings may be somewhat superior to self-ratings of SA because {{more information about the}} true state of the environment is usually available to the observer than to the operator, who may be focused on performing the task (i.e., trained observers may have more complete knowledge of the situation). However, observers have only limited knowledge about the operator's concept of the situation and cannot have complete insight into the mental state of the individual being evaluated. Thus, <b>observers</b> <b>are</b> forced to rely more on operators' observable actions and verbalizations in order to infer their level of SA. In this case, such actions and verbalizations are best assessed using performance and behavioral measures of SA, as described next.|$|E
25|$|Although several {{versions}} of many-worlds {{have been proposed}} since Hugh Everett's original work, they all contain one key idea: the equations of physics that model the time evolution of systems without embedded <b>observers</b> <b>are</b> sufficient for modelling systems which do contain observers; in particular there is no observation-triggered wave function collapse which the Copenhagen interpretation proposes. Provided the theory is linear {{with respect to the}} wavefunction, the exact form of the quantum dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, relativistic quantum field theory or some form of quantum gravity or string theory, does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a metatheory applicable to all linear quantum theories, and there is no experimental evidence for any non-linearity of the wavefunction in physics. MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or multiverse in this context) is composed of a quantum superposition of very many, possibly even non-denumerably infinitely many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{class of}} model proposes that <b>observers</b> <b>are</b> {{limited by the}} total number of items which can be encoded, either because the capacity of VSTM itself is limited (e.g., Cowan, 2001; Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988). This type of model has obvious similarities to urn models used in probability theory (see, for example, Mendenhall, 1967). In essence, an urn model assumes that VSTM is restricted in storage capacity to only a few items, k (often estimated to lie in the range of three-to-five in adults, though fewer in children (Riggs, McTaggart & Simpson, 2006)). The probability that a suprathreshold change will be detected is simply the probability that the change element is encoded in VSTM (i.e., k/N). This capacity limit has been linked to the posterior parietal cortex, the activity of which initially increases with the number of stimuli in the arrays, but saturates at higher set-sizes (Todd & Marois, 2004). Although urn models are used commonly to describe performance limitations in VSTM (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997; Pashler, 1988; Sperling, 1960), it is only recently that the actual structure of items stored has been considered. Luck and colleagues have reported a series of experiments designed specifically to elucidate the structure of information held in VSTM (Luck & Vogel, 1997). This work provides evidence that items stored in VSTM are coherent objects, and not the more elementary features of which those objects are composed.|$|E

25|$|In Redemption Ark, Skade and Clavain {{independently}} encounter technology {{captured by}} the Mademoiselle, that permits the alteration of a ship's inertial mass in order to permit high-g acceleration for interstellar travel. It works by suppressing fluctuations and turmoil in quantum foam that supposedly causes momentum and inertia (similar {{to the concept of}} Higgs Bosons). It is also mentioned in that the technology may have been linked to the alien tower (in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Skade tries to modify the technology with the help of Exordium to allow faster than light travel, via a state transition from tardyonic to tachyonic, but her efforts are spectacularly unsuccessful, and the technology itself has the side effect of removing individuals caught in the transition bubbles from all recent history, as well as crippling her ship. Only those very close to the area of effect remember a person who is erased or unravelled backwards in time and recorded history indicates a much earlier death of that person. Because the victims (the deleted and nearby <b>observers)</b> <b>are</b> the only thing that remain from the time line where the victims began, people suddenly panicking and searching for a 'colleague' who died years before (in the new timeframe) can be the only sign of an accident. This happens at least twice in the novels. The Inhibitors make reference to a similar effect erasing entire species from history. As such, neither they nor any other species in the galaxy with the technology to build inertia suppressing drives ever use them to travel faster than light.|$|E
