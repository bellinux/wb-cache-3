25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of <b>our</b> <b>cars,</b> not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
500|$|Then-president George W. Bush, {{when asked}} whether he would watch the film, responded: [...] "Doubt it." [...] “New {{technologies}} will change how we live and how we drive <b>our</b> <b>cars,</b> which all will have the beneficial effect of improving the environment,” Bush said. “And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases {{have been caused by}} mankind or because of natural effects and focus on the technologies that will enable us to live better lives {{and at the same time}} protect the environment”. Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true." [...] White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino stated that [...] "The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity".|$|E
500|$|On Friday, 29 April, {{during the}} first {{qualifying}} session to determine the starting order for the race, Rubens Barrichello, a driver for Jordan, hit a kerb at the Variante Bassa corner at 140mph (225km/h), launching him into the air. He hit {{the top of the}} tyre barrier, and was knocked unconscious. His car rolled several times after landing before coming to rest upside down. Medical teams treated him at the crash site, and he was taken to the circuit's medical centre before being transferred to Maggiore Hospital in Bologna by helicopter for routine tests and observation to be carried out. He returned to the race meeting the next day, although his broken nose and a plaster cast on his arm forced him to sit {{out the rest of the}} race weekend. Ten years after the incident, Damon Hill, who drove for the Williams-Renault team at the time, described the feeling after the crash: [...] "We all brushed ourselves off and carried on qualifying, reassured that <b>our</b> <b>cars</b> were tough as tanks and we could be shaken but not hurt." ...|$|E

500|$|Max Mosley, the {{president}} of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher's comments saying that his comments [...] "reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude". Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind <b>our</b> <b>cars</b> – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E

Meanwhile, we show non-separability {{in the sense of}} Florig-Summers for <b>our</b> <b>CAR</b> systems. Entanglement degrees by Narnhofer are generalized to an arbitrary, that is, not-necessarily commuting pair of general C ∗-systems. These new entanglement degrees are investigated with some explicit calculations for certain pairs of <b>our</b> <b>CAR</b> systems. We introduce a notion named half-sided entanglement via our generalized entanglement degree. By using this notion, we describe those certain notable features of {{quantum entanglement}} which originate from CAR. ...|$|R

[...] "The F40 is for the most enthusiastic of our owners who want nothing but sheer performance. It isn't a laboratory for the future, as the 959 is. It is not Star Wars.

2500|$|Earnhardt {{died while}} {{competing}} in the 2001 Daytona 500, a NASCAR-sanctioned automobile race at Daytona International Speedway. NASCAR sanctions required {{the use of a}} carburetor restrictor plate for races held at the track. In 2000, the year before Earnhardt died, NASCAR instituted additional restrictions to the springs and shocks used on the cars, causing Earnhardt to complain to the media, [...] "The rules took NASCAR [...] Winston Cup racing and made it some of the sorriest racing. They took racing {{out of the hands of}} the drivers and the crews. We can't adjust and make <b>our</b> <b>cars</b> drive like we want. They just killed the racing at Daytona.

2500|$|American Motors {{changed its}} {{advertising}} agency to Wells, Rich, and Greene, which was headed by Mary Wells Lawrence. The automaker wanted {{to attract the}} highly individualistic, [...] "non-average buyer". The new agency established innovative campaigns and promotions for AMC that emphasized value for the money in direct comparisons to the competition showing [...] "elegantly coifed beauties swooping from swank settings into modest AMC Rebels just as contentedly as if the cars were Continentals. Meanwhile, an off-camera voice proclaims: 'Either we're charging too little for <b>our</b> <b>cars</b> or everyone else is charging too much.'" [...] The advertising was highly controversial because it violated the accepted rule of not attacking the competition. This marketing was successful in bringing AMC back to the firm's economy and practical-car roots in customers' minds, which resulted in higher sales.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the biggest}} change was the {{decision}} to keep the MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price) of the base two-door model to within US$200 of the Volkswagen Beetle. The domestic Big Three automakers {{did not respond to}} this strategy, thus giving AMC a big price differential over the competing domestic models. Sales of the Rambler American increased and the showroom traffic boosted morale among AMC's independent dealerships. This was backed up by a marketing campaign stating, [...] "Either we're charging too little for <b>our</b> <b>cars</b> or everyone else is charging too much." [...] The promotion and lower prices were designed to rekindle the Rambler American as a practical and economical car in customers' minds. Advertisements by AMC's new agency, Wells, Rich, and Greene, headed by Mary Wells Lawrence violated the accepted rule of not attacking the competition.|$|E
