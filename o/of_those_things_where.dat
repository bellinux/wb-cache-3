Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but {{it has something to do}} with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble.

On July 3, when the rosters for the 2011 MLB All-Star Game in Phoenix, Arizona were broadcast on TBS, it was announced that Hamels was voted onto the National League team along with fellow pitchers and teammates Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Plácido Polanco, and Shane Victorino. He was not eligible to play, however, because he had pitched the Sunday prior to the All-Star Game.

Water continued, [...] "it was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E

You can’t approach them. It is one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success.

2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> wild <b>things</b> <b>where</b> I went to audition. And I thought I was funny {{and the person}} I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I {{think it was a}} big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|R
5000|$|On March 24, 2015, Joseph Gilgun was {{confirmed}} to be joining {{the cast of}} Preacher as Cassidy. Catlin had found Gilgun, to which Goldberg said, [...] "The first audition Sam saw was Joe and he kept saying, 'You guys have got to see this guy. It's a weird tape that he filmed in his mother's basement", to which he added, [...] "It was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> weird <b>things</b> <b>where</b> we just didn't watch it for weeks. We met with 100 other people." [...] However, after watching the audition tape, Rogen and Goldberg were impressed. Both men first met Gilgun during a Skype call with Rogen noting, [...] "... it was like talking to Cassidy. He was the guy. There was no one who was even close to a second choice for that role. If we hadn't gotten him, I don't know what the f— we would've done." [...] Gilgun spoke of his portrayal of Cassidy, remarking that [...] "They let me by myself", while furthering that sentiment by stating, [...] "They let me run riot and be a total a-hole and do my job ... There's not the right words in the right order to describe it. 'Thanks' just feels a bit empty. And they pay me! They pay {{me to be a}} complete wanker every single day! And I’ve been doing that for years without making a f—ing penny." ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 7, Close Hatches faced Beholder and Princess of Sylmar in the Grade I Ogden Phipps Stakes at Belmont {{and started}} the 2.9/1 third favorite. The filly settled in third place behind Classic Point and Antipathy before moving up on the outside {{to take the lead}} over two and a half furlongs out. In the {{straight}} she held off a strong challenge from Princess of Sylmar to win by a head, with Anitipathy, Beholder and Belle Gallantey close behind. Commenting on the victory, Mott said [...] "we've been pointing toward this race since early spring and it's just one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cases <b>where</b> <b>things</b> worked out, <b>where</b> you made a plan and things come to fruition." [...] In the Personal Ensign Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on August 22, Close Hatches started 1.95/1 favorite against six rivals including Princess of Sylmar, Antipathy, Belle Gallantey (winner of the Delaware Handicap in July) and Fiftyshadesofhay. She took the lead soon after the start, went three lengths clear entering the straight and increased her advantage in the closing stages to win by five lengths from Fiftyshadesofhay. The Blood-Horse described her success as [...] "a dominating victory" [...] which [...] "strengthened her hold on the older female division".|$|R
500|$|Godrich's {{father died}} {{on the day of}} the {{recording}} of the string sessions for [...] "Burn the Witch". According to Godrich, [...] "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E

Hamels started Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees, pitching [...] innings, allowing 5 earned runs and taking the loss as the Yankees won that game 8-5. Afterward, he told reporters, [...] "I can't wait for it (the season) to end. It's been mentally draining. It's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where,</b> a year in, you just can’t wait for a fresh start."

[...] The Phillies lost the World Series to the New York Yankees in six games.|$|E
500|$|The {{biological}} father of Superman. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also {{considered for the}} role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three-and-a-half or four months before I even got {{in front of the}} camera." ...|$|E
5000|$|Snipes is luckless in the part, which merely {{demands a}} lot of scowling, then moving aside to let the stunt double take over. (The movie's other big treat {{features}} that nameless individual, who leaps off a building and swings, {{as if on a}} bungee cord, to a nearby station roof, then races after the train pulling out and leaps to land upon its roof; that's fun, but it's no movie in itself.) —Stephen Hunter, writing in The Washington Post Dissatisfied with the film's quality, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said that it was [...] "Not so much a sequel to The Fugitive as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than-average direction—is nowhere in evidence." [...] Stephen Hunter, writing for The Washington Post, reasoned, [...] "It turns out to be one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> lame double-agent <b>things</b> <b>where</b> everybody's working for everybody else, the security of Taiwan (Taiwan!) is at stake, and it never quite lurches into clarity or acquires any real emotional punch. I didn't think the end of The Fugitive was so great either: Who wants to watch doctors fistfight on a roof? But by the time it winds down, U.S. Marshals has all but destroyed itself." [...] Film critic Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide was not consumed with the nature of the subject matter, declaring, [...] "To every hit there is a season, and a time for every sequel under heaven — no matter what narrative contortions it takes." [...] She later surmised, [...] "The minute Gerard mocks Royce's 'nickel-plated sissy pistol,' it's clear they're headed for a cathartic showdown, and anyone who can't see which member of Gerard's merry band might as well be wearing a 'Dead Meat Walking' T-shirt really shouldn't be allowed to operate complicated machinery." ...|$|R

500|$|The album {{marked a}} {{departure}} in Fall Out Boy's sound {{in which the}} band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound. Infinity on High {{has been compared to}} the work of pop punk bands such as Green Day, with Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commenting, [...] "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies." [...] Stump explained that the album contains a variety of different moods: [...] "It’s one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> you get older as a band and you do your own thing...The older Fall Out Boy elements, from the early records, are definitely there, and this album is an extension of that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Gaiman. After Steven Moffat {{replaced}} Russell T Davies as the showrunner of Doctor Who, being a fan of Gaiman's blog, Moffat met with Gaiman and Gaiman had asked to write an episode. In an interview Gaiman stated [...] "I came {{up with something that}} was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> you thought that nobody's done that before." [...] The episode was originally titled [...] "The House of Nothing" [...] before Gaiman sat down to write it, but that was changed to [...] "Bigger on the Inside". This title remained until about six weeks before the episode aired, but the crew was beginning to worry that [...] "Bigger on the Inside" [...] would give away the surprise that Idris was the TARDIS, so it was changed. [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] was also a fake title attached to the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani; then-producer John Nathan-Turner had changed the title to that on his planning board in an attempt to weed out a suspected leak in his office.|$|E
500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

It's one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where,</b> hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan {{go out of their way}} to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E

Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”.

Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled.
