25|$|Most {{regulators}} have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases {{gas from the}} cylinder at a constant intermediate pressure, despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This {{is similar to the}} first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the intermediate pressure to the low <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure.</b> The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.|$|E

2500|$|Some simpler or cheaper oxygen-fuel {{regulators}} {{have only a}} single stage regulator, or only a single gauge.

For low-volume users, this is an acceptable simplification. Welding regulators, unlike simpler LPG heating regulators, retain their outlet (hose) pressure gauge and do not rely on the calibration of the adjustment knob.

50|$|The <b>outlet</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> and {{the inlet}} pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of}} the large spring. If the supply pressure falls, {{it is as if the}} large spring compression is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an equilibrium pressure is reached. Thus, if the supply pressure falls, the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> will increase, provided the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> remains below the falling supply pressure. This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet pressure causes the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> to climb. If the spring compression is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower the supply pressure, the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|E

It is demonstrated that the DSP designed can well adjust the stagger angle of IGV online, and the efficiency under different operating conditions can be optimized.

40|$|Fluid {{drainage}} via the lymphatics prevents swelling due {{to excess}} fluid in interstitial space. Since interstitial fluid volume can vary dramatically, {{the function of}} lymphangions are rather dynamic {{so that they can}} contend with the wide ranges of lymph flow and pressure. Sharing with blood vessels an acute sensitivity to mechanical stresses, lymphangions could be expected to be similarly sensitive to prolonged changes in transmural pressure and flow. The purpose of this research was to quantify the adaptation of lymphangions to prolonged alterations in lymph hydrodynamics and to investigate how adaptation of individual lymphangions acts together within a network to affect the regulation of lymph flow. In project I, bovine postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels were partially occluded for three days, which divided the vessel into two segments. Both segments, therefore, were exposed to the same flow but different transmural pressures. In project II, an isometric preparation was employed to study developed wall tension in lymphangions exposed to mesenteric venous hypertension. In project III, an analytical model of a symmetrical lymphatic network was developed to investigate how its pressure-flow relationship emerges from the complex interaction of its pumping lymphangions. Results from this research indicate that lymphangions become stronger pumps when exposed to prolonged increases in transmural pressure, but exposure to prolonged venous hypertension attenuates lymphangion pumping. The main mechanism for lymphangion adaptation is the alteration of preload-dependent maximal tension developed by lymphatic muscle. Lower cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration {{is likely to be the}} underlying cause for weaker developed tension. The analytical model suggests that the ratio of lymphangion systolic contractility to diastolic stiffness results in a differential response of lymph flow to changes in inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures.</b> This differential sensitivity to inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures</b> allows homeostatic responses to both microvascular and venous hypertension, and provides a framework for interpreting the functional implications of chronic lymphangion adaption...|$|R
