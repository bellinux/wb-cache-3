The first layer including data extraction and encoding, the second layer is mainly built up by the improved BP NN. The results show that the system can fully fuse the data collected by the sensors and realize the real-time safety monitoring of the <b>grain</b> <b>storage.</b> During the <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> procedure, the factors influencing the grain most are temperature, moisture, insect pests and micro-organism, these factors correlate and interact with each other, causing influencing elements such as moisture condensation, stack fever, stack mildew and insects, which result in grain store stability and safety varying, <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> quality descends. In addition, the <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> is with characteristics of centralized, large volume and space, which makes it hard for the traditional single sensor to identify the store state, so the data from different sensors with different physical meanings at the same time must be needed, but the multi-sensors data will definitely cause information redundancy even contradictions.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBrian C. BriggemanGrain Elevators have towered {{the plains}} of Southwest Kansas for over {{the last half of}} a century. Many of these large white {{concrete}} structures were built during the 1950 s using a slip form concrete design. While new <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> has been built over time, many of the original slip form structures remain {{a large part of the}} farm cooperatives <b>storage</b> capacity. <b>Grain</b> production has continued to increase and put greater demand on storage facilities and handling capabilities. Thus, there is a need for cooperatives to meet the future demands of farmers by replacing or updating <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> assets. The objective of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> options that a cooperative, primarily the Garden City Co-op, Inc.

The project examines three different options for <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> including concrete, steel, and bunker storage. The project will also examine extending the life of an original slip form elevator by installing a gunite bin liner. To determine which option that provides the most economic benefit to GCC and its members, Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return are estimated for each <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> option.

40|$|In this study, a {{measuring}} system for estimating <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> had been developed. The system {{consists of the}} measurement platform and the lifting mechanism. This system is operated with forklifts to rise to a certain height (limit of forklift), then with the lifting mechanism to reach a higher position to measure the volume of <b>grain</b> <b>storage.</b> The measurement platform is composed of a laser distance meter, two micro stepping motors, a camera and an embedded computer. According to the distance obtained by the laser distance meter and its orientation (consistent with {{the value of the}} motors steps), we can compute spatial coordinate of measurement points. The measuring system also can save the images and the measurement point coordinate of the <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> for future review. Moreover, we developed a non-horizontal tilt correction method that can calibrate measurement point from the tilt state of coordinate to the level state of coordinate, then estimate the volume of the <b>grain</b> <b>storage.</b> We selected the appropriate measuring methods: measurement points automatically connect algorithms, and taper volume compensation, in order to calculate the volume of <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> accurately. In <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> inspection, we stitched the images of <b>grain</b> <b>storages</b> to a panorama image, and then built the link of the history <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> images in the database system. The panorama likes a map of the history <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> images for the <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> inspection. Base on the experiment results, the difference between the volume of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> estimating by the measurement system and the actual volume is small, and the repeatability is also high. The results confirmed that the application of non-horizontal tilt correction method and panoramic imaging system in monitoring <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> is applicable, and can further replace the manual inspection. 本系統主要由量測平台與爬升機構所構成，量測平台架設於爬升機構上，爬升機構則是與堆高機結合，利用堆高機爬升至一定高度後，再經由爬升機構微調平台高度，最後由量測平台進行榖堆量測。量測平台由量測距離的雷射測距儀、微步進馬達、彩色攝影機與處理傳輸資訊的嵌入式電腦所構成。利用測距儀量測平台與榖堆測點的距離，搭配馬達的步進數，便可以換算測點的三維卡氏座標，並於量測時儲存榖堆測點座標與影像供檢閱。本研究發展一套非水平傾斜校正法，對於非水平傾斜狀態下量測平台所測得的三維座標，可以校正至水平狀態時的座標值，依此估算榖堆體積。此外，本系統可依照榖堆外觀，選擇適合的量測方式、自動量測點連線計算法則與錐度體積補償方式以計算榖堆體積，提升榖堆估算體積的精確度。榖堆拍照稽查方面，將榖堆影像黏合成榖堆的全景影像，並與量測時儲存的測點影像建立歷史影像檢閱資料庫系統，提供稽查人員察視榖堆是否有異動的情形。 根據試驗結果顯示，本研究所開發的量測平台估算的體積與實際物體體積值差異不大，估算結果的重複性亦相當高。全景榖堆的影像黏合與歷史影像檢閱系統也都成功地建構完成。試驗結果證實本榖堆儲量監測系統確實可以取代人工稽查方式。摘要		i Abstract		ii 目錄		iii 圖目錄		v 表目錄		ix 符號目錄	x 第一章 前言	 1 1. 1 研究動機	 1 1. 2 研究目的	 2 第二章 文獻探討	 3 2. 1 量測體積技術與歷代穀倉量測系統	 3 2. 2 量測平台傾斜時的量測誤差	 7 2. 3 全景影像黏合技術	 7 2. 4 環場雷射掃描與影像黏貼技術結合的虛擬實境	 10 2. 5 遠端桌面與藍芽無線技術	 12 2. 6 資料庫系統技術	 12 第三章 理論與分析	 15 3. 1 非水平傾斜校正	 15 3. 2 量測數據轉換空間座標值	 19 3. 3 穀堆體積估算	 19 3. 3. 1 體積估算法	 20 3. 3. 2 量測點連線方式	 20 3. 3. 3 錐度補償方式	 29 3. 4 影像邊緣延伸處理	 36 第四章 實驗設備與方法	 39 4. 1 實驗設備	 39 4. 1. 1 硬體架構	 39 4. 1. 2 量測平台設計與製造	 44 4. 2 軟體程式架構	 47 4. 2. 1 穀堆體積估測主程式	 47 4. 2. 2 穀堆體積估測副程式	 50 4. 3 體積估測程式標準作業流程	 52 4. 3. 1 前置作業	 52 4. 3. 2 體積估測流程	 52 4. 4 水平校正試驗	 61 4. 4. 1 長方體紙箱試驗	 62 4. 4. 2 模擬榖堆外形紙箱試驗	 64 4. 5 榖倉穀堆體積估測試驗	 64 第五章 試驗結果與討論	 66 5. 1 長方體紙箱體積試驗結果	 66 5. 2 模擬榖堆外形紙箱試驗結果	 67 5. 2. 1 六角形柱紙箱試驗結果	 67 5. 2. 2 兩堆疊紙箱試驗結果	 68 5. 3 榖倉穀堆體積估測試驗結果	 69 5. 4 不同量測點連線方式應用於穀堆試驗結果	 90 第六章 結論	 95 參考文獻	 9...|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsDaniel M. O'BrienOn-farm <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> plays a {{key role}} in the {{production}} and distribution of corn in the United States. It can have economic impacts on a farm’s profitability and production efficiency over time. With the free market system of the United States, market fundamentals are a key component of decisions made on the farm regarding construction of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> facilities and how they are used in marketing decisions throughout a given production and marketing year. This analysis researches how <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> decisions in the Northern Mississippi area are effected by corn basis differentials between the Memphis, TN river market and the Northern Alabama corn market. Corn basis differentials are considered along with annual changes in corn futures market carry in response to variations in grain market fundamentals. The profitability of constructing, maintaining, and operating on-farm <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> is analyzed based on the local history of the local corn market basis patterns and the carry priced into the corn futures market. Through this analysis it was found that the biggest obstacle affecting the profitability of on-farm <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> was the upfront cost of the facility. As costs of the facility were incurred, grain had to be stored for longer periods of time in order to be profitable based on history of improved basis and market carry over time. On-farm storage became profitable over a shorter storage period once the upfront costs of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> and handling facilities were paid based on the operating costs and market conditions within the analysis. On-farm storage can be a useful tool for a farm to increase profitability over time, beyond the scope of this analysis. This analysis proves that in the Northern Mississippi area over time, <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> can be profitable based on improved cash basis and futures market carry. However, due to ever-changing market conditions, on-farm <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> does not replace the need for the development of grain marketing plans in order to increase the likelihood of profitability...|$|R

There are a number of technologies for handling and storing grain, ranging from capital intensive to labour intensive methods. Optimal provision of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> capacity can therefore be analysed in the framework of the conventional peak load pricing model. An investment model of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> is outlined and the optimal technology choices are determined according to simple investment roles. Capacity of the more capital intensive storage types should be only provided if the extra capital cost is justified by the saving in operating costs, which depends on the expected utilisation of storage. Some level of supply failure is justifiable. An examination of <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> costs in Western Australia revealed that horizontal storage was the best technology for dealing with most <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> demand at sites where turnover is limited In the receival period.
