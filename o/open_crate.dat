50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of wooden crate designs. By {{far the most}} common are 'closed', 'open' and 'framed'. A Closed Crate {{is one that is}} completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An <b>Open</b> <b>Crate</b> is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of an <b>open</b> <b>crate</b> as compared to a closed crate. Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the crate would be considered an <b>open</b> <b>crate.</b> The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered 'cleats' rather than sheathing thus rendering the crate unsheathed. An unsheathed crate is a frame crate. A Frame Crate is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically an <b>open</b> <b>crate</b> will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.|$|E

Worse results were reported by Zhu et al. for rubber seeds stored in piles, which showed a 1400 relative increase in acid content upon storage at 27  °C. This is likely due to poor ventilation leading to a higher pile temperature and Mildew infection [15].|$|R
50|$|Players control {{either a}} {{male or female}} avatar inside a {{shopping}} centre. Players are {{able to use the}} game's physics engine to destroy the environment, although this provides no specific reward to the player. The objective of the game is to complete all the quests, which can be obtained by using a payphone in-game. The game's quests include kicking <b>open</b> <b>crates</b> to obtain a panda mask, to jumping on maintenance platforms to obtain a doll. Full completion requires that the player gets every achievement. The freeform destruction of the game was compared to Goat Simulator.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Crash has the ability to jump to navigate ledges, spin in a tornado-like fashion to break <b>open</b> <b>crates</b> and defeat enemies, deliver a body slam to break open tough objects and can either slide across the ground or crouch and crawl to get past low areas. Crash can expand on these abilities by defeating boss characters, often resulting in more powerful attacks or increased jumping and running prowess. Crash starts the game with five lives. Crash loses a life when he is struck by an enemy attack or suffers any other type of damage. More lives can be earned by instructing Crash to collect 100 [...] "Wumpa Fruits" [...] or break <b>open</b> a special <b>crate</b> to collect a life. Crash can be shielded from enemy attack by collecting an Aku Aku mask. Collecting three of these masks allows temporary invulnerability from all minor dangers.|$|R
5000|$|Offense: Capable of {{stronger}} attacks, but is {{more fragile}} {{than the other}} suits of the game. The Offense Suit allows the player to punch <b>open</b> gray <b>crates,</b> which grants access to extra items and a few extra areas.|$|R

5|$|Players of Donkey Kong Country control {{one of two}} {{characters}}: Donkey Kong or {{his nephew}} Diddy. The player can switch between characters if they are both on the screen. Donkey is {{the larger of the}} two, and can defeat enemies more easily while Diddy is faster and more agile. In several levels, players can gain assistance from various animals, who are found by breaking <b>open</b> <b>crates.</b> These helpers include Rambi the Rhino, Expresso the Ostrich, Enguarde the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot. Each animal can be found in an appropriately themed level: for example, Enguarde can only be found underwater, and Squawks is found in one cave level. Some animals can also give players access to bonus games.|$|R

40|$|Green {{bell peppers}} (Capsicum annuum cv. Cardio) were stored in <b>open</b> <b>crates</b> at 5 degreesC, using a novel system for {{maintenance}} of relative humidity (RH). A hollow fiber membrane contactor allowed adequate transfer of water vapor between {{the air in}} the storage room and a liquid desiccant. The membrane was made of polyetherimide (PEI), coated on the inside with a thin non-porous silicone layer. The desiccant was a dilute aqueous glycerol solution, which was pumped through the hollow fibers at a low flow rate. Produce was placed in ventilated 5001 containers with a closed lid. During the 3 weeks of the experiment, RH could be maintained within a narrow range each day (e. g. 90. 5 +/- 0. 1 %). RH could be changed by adjusting the glycerol concentration and/or the temperature of the desiccant. The control was a 5501 container connected to the hollow fiber membrane set up which had no glycerol solution (average RH 93 %). The contactor thus removed water vapor in this set up. The quality of the bell peppers (visible peel shrivelling and fungus development), after 3 weeks of storage, was highly dependent on RH. Compared with the control container and with packaging in conventional cardboard boxes for bell peppers (average RH 86 %), the contactor system reduced fungus development without increasing shrivelling. The improvement compared with cardboard boxes was presumably due to reduction of local differences in RH. Such differences were avoided in the containers where the packaging was very <b>open</b> (<b>open</b> <b>crates,</b> with space in between them, and only two layers of fruit) and where the airflow was rather high. In preliminary experiments with red currants and pears the contactor system also functioned well (a) at subzero temperatures, (b) when it was combined with controlled atmosphere (7. 5 % oxygen and 20 % carbon dioxide), or (c) when it released water vapor. It is concluded that the system is promising for the large-scale storage of several fresh commodities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break <b>open</b> <b>crates</b> containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|R
50|$|Each time a unit {{is used in}} a battle, their Fatigue meter {{is filled}} and their maximum health is decreased. The meter is {{depleted}} by either giving that unit gifts or purifying them at special statues. During battles, adjacent allied units can engage in Support conversations. In dungeon environments, players can roam freely through a 3D environment with a party of ten units, able to avoid encounters if they wish and smash objects or <b>open</b> <b>crates</b> to obtain money and items. Upon engaging an enemy, the perspective switches to the standard top-down battle screen. An added function is Mila's Turnwheel, a mechanic whereby players can undo three turns to redo moves if something has gone wrong such as a unit falling in battle. In addition, Fire Emblem Echoes features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being main protagonists Alm and Celica, in addition to characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: using an Amiibo summons a phantom unit for a single turn {{at the cost of}} a character's health. Amiibos not related to the Fire Emblem series summon allied monsters.|$|R

40|$|SummaryUse of {{antimicrobial}} {{feed additives}} in food animal production {{is associated with}} selection for drug resistance in bacterial pathogens, which can then be released into the environment through occupational exposures, high volume ventilation of animal houses, and land application of animal wastes. We tested the hypothesis that current methods of transporting food animals from farms to slaughterhouses may result in pathogen releases and potential exposures of persons in vehicles traveling on the same road. Air and surface samples were taken from cars driving behind poultry trucks for 17 miles. Air conditioners and fans were turned off and windows fully opened. Background and blank samples were used for quality control. Samples were analyzed for susceptible and drug-resistant strains. Results indicate {{an increase in the}} number of total aerobic bacteria including both susceptible and drug-resistant enterococci isolated from air and surface samples, and suggest that food animal transport in <b>open</b> <b>crates</b> introduces a novel route of exposure to harmful microorganisms and may disseminate these pathogens into the general environment. These findings support the need for further exposure characterization, and attention to improving methods of food animal transport, especially in highly trafficked regions of high density farming such as the Delmarva Peninsula...|$|R

50|$|Spyro the Dragon puts {{players in}} {{the control of the}} titular Spyro, as he travels across various worlds in order to rescue his fellow dragons, recover the stolen treasure, and defeat the evil Gnasty Gnorc. Spyro has two main attacks; {{breathing}} fire and charging with his horns, which must be strategically used for defeating enemies and smashing <b>open</b> <b>crates.</b> Charging can be used against many small enemies but not against larger enemies. Likewise, fire is capable of defeating larger enemies, but can be blocked by enemies that use metal armor. Spyro is also able to glide whilst jumping to reach new areas, with some levels allowing him to fly freely in the air. Spyro's health is represented by the color of his dragonfly partner, Sparx, who also helps him pick up nearby treasure. Taking damage will cause Sparx to lose his color and disappear, leaving Spyro vulnerable, but he can recover health by eating butterflies spawned from defeating small animals. Various treasure can be found in various areas, including inside treasure chests, some of which require certain techniques to break open, or earned by defeating enemies. Enemies that have already had their gems retrieved upon revisiting areas will instead release orbs that can be collected towards earning extra lives.|$|R
