5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) and Esther Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a machine minder and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|E

25|$|When EastEnders {{began in}} 1985, Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Pete (Peter Dean) {{were the only}} two of Lou's {{offspring}} to feature on screen. Through character dialogue in July 1985, the audience were told of the existence of three other children: Keith, Paul and Norma — who had moved away to Romford and Eastbourne before the series began. As the series progressed, Keith, Paul and Norma were apparently forgotten in favour <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> and were not mentioned again.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} ten, White {{was sent}} to Tudor House School, a {{boarding}} school in Moss Vale in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, {{in an attempt to}} abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children.</b> At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a public school in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.|$|E

That rapidity of thought and facility of expression were characteristic of her maturer years. She began a sketch {{of one or more}} columns and usually finished it at one sitting. With increasing years, her health grew better, so that she entered school, but left at the age of 15 to marry.|$|E
25|$|Frank Houston {{sexually abused}} a seven-year-old boy, {{which came to}} light after his mother {{reported}} the abuse to another church.

Frank Houston eventually confessed to the crime. The commission also heard {{that he was involved}} in the sexual abuse <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> in New Zealand. Frank Houston resigned from Hillsong Church in 2000. Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston's resignation letter, he retired from the position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian Life Centre in May 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{symptoms}} of autism spectrum disorders {{can interfere with}} the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of social skills. Children with autism {{have been found to be}} more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> with some sort of a disability. A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.|$|E

He was often bullied for being the son of an immigrant and {{went out of his way}} to avoid some <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> in his neighborhood. Shero credited his childhood experiences as a reason why he tended to be a loner. As a child Shero took up boxing and at age 13 he became a Canadian Bantamweight champion. His success gave him a chance to become a professional boxer, but he decided to play hockey instead. When he signed his first professional contract with the Rangers, his father cautioned him that [...] "hockey players are looking for work when they are 30." [...] When he left Winnipeg's Isaac Newton High School to go off to New York to play for the Rovers, he continued his education in his new surroundings.|$|E

When Scully comforts Mulder and asks if he is all right, he responds with a choked [...] "I'm fine. I'm free." ...|$|E
500|$|When Wheeler was four, {{his father}} was {{appointed}} chief leader writer for the Bradford Observer. The family relocated to Saltaire, a village northwest of Bradford, a cosmopolitan city in Yorkshire, northeast England, [...] which was then {{in the midst of}} the wool trade boom. Wheeler was inspired by the moors surrounding Saltaire and fascinated by the area's archaeology. He later wrote about discovering a late prehistoric cup-marked stone, searching for lithics on Ilkley Moor, and digging into a barrow on Baildon Moor. Although suffering from ill health, Emily Wheeler taught her two children with the help of a maid up to the age of seven or eight. Mortimer remained emotionally distant from his mother, instead being far closer to his father, whose company he favoured over that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children.</b> His father had a keen interest in natural history and a love of fishing and shooting, rural pursuits in which he encouraged Mortimer to take part. Robert acquired many books for his son, particularly on the subject of art history, with Wheeler loving to both read and paint.|$|E
500|$|Hastings, in his decision, {{noted that}} [...] "all of the petitioners' {{causation}} theories {{depend upon the}} validity of certain testing that purported to find evidence of persisting measles virus in the biological materials of Michelle and a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> with autism." [...] However, Hastings concluded that this testing was [...] "not reliable." [...] In his decision, {{he noted that the}} authors of the D'Souza paper first performed PCR on PBMCs from children with autism, which resulted in a large proportion of apparently positive results. However, [...] "the D'Souza group... subjected those apparently positive samples to additional testing techniques in order to determine whether the PCR testing using the Uhlmann primers was truly identifying measles virus and only measles virus.... The application of those two techniques revealed that all but nine of the samples that had initially tested positive by the PCR test using the Uhlmann primers were, in fact, not measles virus." [...] With regard to the 9 remaining samples, the D'Souza paper performed sequencing on 7 of those samples. This step [...] "demonstrated that the material, which in the PCR testing had appeared to be measles virus material, was in fact not measles virus material, but human genetic material." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Oregon Department of Human Services {{agreed to}} pay $2 million into a fund for the future care of twins who were {{allegedly}} abused by their foster parents; this was the largest such settlement in the agency's history. According {{to the civil rights}} suit filed on request of the twins' adoptive mother in December 2007 in U.S. Federal Court, the children were kept in makeshift cages—cribs covered with chicken wire secured by duct tape—in a darkened bedroom known as [...] "the dungeon." [...] The brother and sister often went without food, water or human touch. The boy, who had a shunt put into his head at birth to drain fluid, did not receive medical attention, so when police rescued the twins he was nearly comatose. The same foster family previously took into their care hundreds <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> over nearly four decades. DHS said the foster parents deceived child welfare workers during the checkup visits.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 8, 1911, Elsie Paroubek left her home at 2320 S. Albany Avenue in Chicago, telling her mother {{she was going to}} visit [...] "Auntie," [...] Mrs. Frank Trampota, around the corner at 2325 S. Troy Street. Turning left on 22nd St. and left again on Troy, she {{encountered}} her nine-year-old cousin, Josie Trampota, and a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children</b> who were listening to an organ grinder a short distance from Mrs. Trampota's gate. When the organ grinder moved to the 23rd St. corner, the children followed him, but subsequently left while Elsie remained behind. [...] Several hours later, Elsie's mother went to her sister's house to find Elsie had never arrived. As Elsie had many friends in the area, the women assumed she was visiting at another home, perhaps to spend the night and return the next morning. At 9pm that evening, Frank Paroubek returned from work and went to police at the Hinman Street station to report her missing. Police initially agreed that she was likely spending the night with friends, but when she had not returned by the following morning, Captain John Mahoney took personal charge of the search.|$|E
2500|$|This rescue {{operation}} {{was part of}} a wider project set up in October 1938 by Doreen Warriner, with later assistance from the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia (BCRC), aimed initially at helping exiled anti-Nazi Sudeten leaders to escape the country. As the scope of the project expanded to include these leaders' families, the responsibility for evacuating refugee children was taken on by Nicholas Winton who had come to Prague just before Christmas 1938 to help with the rescue. After weeks dealing with various agencies and interviewing candidate families, Winton returned to London to find guarantors for the children and deal with the sluggish British authorities. Before giving any child a permit for entry to Britain the Home Office needed a guarantor, in this case a person or organisation willing to keep and educate the child up to the age of seventeen and pay £50 {{to cover the cost of}} their eventual repatriation. This is [...] Trevor Chadwick had originally gone to Prague to select two boys to be looked after at his family's preparatory school in Swanage, Dorset. Soon after delivering them, however, he decided to return to the city to help with the evacuation <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>children.</b> He remained in Prague until June 1939 and organised a number of Kindertransport trains, working in partnership with Winton at the London end.|$|E
