50|$|Although a {{powerful}} engine for its time, the 16 Valve engine can experience some {{problems that can}} be solved easily. One of the few problems is <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> problems leading to broken timing belts. The <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>gear</b> itself can fail around the mounting flange, or, more often, the weak 8.8(grade 5) grade bolt holding the gear can break. It is strongly recommended to use a 10.9 (grade 8) grade bolt when replacing the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>gear.</b> Another cause for timing belt failure is improperly adjusting the timing belt on engines with a manual tensioner (1989 to very early 1990 models only) or improperly adjusting the balance shaft belt. Because this is an interference engine, damage will occur if the timing belt fails. Another common occurrence is that the balance shaft's oil seals are prone to leak on older engines. New replacement sealings tend to start leaking again due to 'worn in irregularities' on the shaft itself. Many people have removed the balance shaft belt or the balance shaft assemblies altogether to prevent belt failure and/or leakage. The balance shafts are only there to lessen high rpm second order vibrations, and removing them will only affect high rpm vibrations. Once all the common problems are solved, the 16 Valve engines are just as reliable as their SOHC counterparts.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who {{moves away from the}} OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>gears</b> {{in the same way as}} Toyota's 1JZ GTE engine as found in the Supra MKIII.

2500|$|... 22 October 2012: G-CHCN, an EC225 LP of CHC Scotia, ditched in the North Sea 32 {{miles south}} west of Shetland whilst {{en route from}} Aberdeen to the West Phoenix {{drilling}} rig. All 19 on board were rescued. [...] A special bulletin issued by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the main and standby <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> were not working; a 360-degree crack found on the bevel gear vertical shaft of the gearbox had prevented the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>gears</b> from being driven. A worldwide grounding of the type was initiated in response. In both of the 2012 incidents, although the main gearbox lubrication system had failed, the backup system was working correctly but displaying an erroneous warning light, due to an incorrect specification of a pressure switch, {{which led to the}} helicopters being ditched.|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} a new design of an <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for Tatra T 158 {{transfer}} case. The new solution should replace earlier involute internal <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> which {{is not able to}} provide sufficent lubrication. The main problem of the old design is a poor suction at low speeds of the vehicle. Gerotor type of the pump has been chosen. Its main advantages are a convenient specific flow rate and good volumetric efficency. In an analytic calculation of the <b>pump</b> <b>gearing</b> also important functional parameters have been checked, like a pressure angle, flow rate, flow irregularity, specific flow rate, specific slipping. A design with and without axial clearance compensation is introduced. Measurements on a test rig confirmed good suction ability even in low revs. Generated flow rate and pressure are improved. That is a good prerequisite for faster assembly of transfer case with no testing of each <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> The tests have not revealed any unexpected wear of parts of the pump so far. It is supposed an application of the new gerotor design in a serial production of T 158 truck and other types in the future...|$|R

50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|The engine has a forged crankshaft, {{supported}} in changeable thin-wall bearing shells. The journals of the crankshaft and the connecting rods are polished and induction hardened. The counter-weights are screwed {{on the center}} and outer crank arms. The flywheel {{is connected to the}} power take-off side of the engine with screws. The gear drive side of the crankshaft is equipped with a gear, which drives the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and the <b>gear</b> which drives the camshaft. The connecting rods are forged and weight-balanced. While the small connecting rod bore has a bearing pressed into the bore, the crank-sided bore of the connecting rod has a thin-wall bearing. For lubrication and cooling of the connecting rods they have small oil-ducts. Oil is pressed in the ducts from a nozzle at the upper side of the connecting rod. The piston journals are secured with two circlips and are bathed in oil. A heat resistant light-metal-alloy is used for the cast pistons. The combustion chamber is integrated into the piston. For compression, the pistons have two piston rings which slots are cast into the piston. The pistons are also equipped with an oil control ring. The cylinder liners are made of centrifugally cast iron, two rubber rings seal the liners off from the crankcase. The engine has two cast iron cylinder blocks with two cylinders; every block has a head, which makes two cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|Electric <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are not used, {{again for}} reliability. Some 'turbo timer' {{electric}} auxiliary <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> are sometimes fitted to turbocharged engines. These are a second <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> {{that continues to}} run after the engine has stopped, providing cooling oil to the hot bearings of a turbocharger for some minutes, whilst it cools down. These are supplementary pumps and do not replace the main, mechanical, <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{hydraulic}} efficiency, modern automatic transmissions tend to apply electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> in their hydraulic system. The electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> can support the mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for cooling, lubrication, and maintaining the line pressure at low engine speeds. In addition, the start–stop function can be realized {{by means of the}} electric oil pump; thus, the fuel consumption can be further reduced. This article proposes a method of applying two-pump system (one electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and one mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump)</b> in automatic transmissions based on the forward driving simulation. A mathematical model for calculating the transmission power loss is developed. The power loss transfers to heat which requires oil flow for cooling and lubrication. A leakage model is developed to calculate the leakage of the hydraulic system. In order to satisfy the flow requirement, a flow-based control strategy for the electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is developed. Simulation results of different driving cycles show that there is a best combination of the size of electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and the size of mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> with respect to the optimal energy conservation. Besides, the two-pump system can also satisfy the requirement of the start–stop function. This research is extremely valuable for the forward design of a two-pump system in automatic transmissions with respect to energy conservation and start–stop function...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the adequate lubrication of the moving parts, the oil flow in a hermetic reciprocating compressor has a significant influence on the thermal characteristics of a compressor. The present work {{is concerned with the}} investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system of a reciprocating hermetic compressor used in household refrigeration appliances. The considered <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> system consists of a centrifugal pump immersed in the oil sump of the hermetic compressor and a helical groove machined on the crankshaft. The focus of this work lies on the immersed part of the centrifugal <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and its interaction with the oil in the oil sump. To analyse the flow in the immersed area of the <b>oil</b> <b>pump,</b> the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS Fluent is used. The free surface of the oil flow is modelled with the volume of fluid (VOF) method. A numerical investigation is used to study the influence of the immersion depth and the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> design on <b>oil</b> mass flow rate and flow field at the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> intake. To evaluate the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> regarding the applicability in variable speed compressors, the influence of the rotational speed on the oil mass flow is also explored...|$|R
50|$|Rubbing {{of metal}} engine parts inevitably {{produces}} some microscopic metallic particles from {{the wearing of}} the surfaces.
