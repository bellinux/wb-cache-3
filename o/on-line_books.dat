40|$|We {{describe}} {{our experience}} in developing Web Search Systems using Oracle's SQL*TextRetrieval. In the prototype system we store <b>on-line</b> <b>books</b> in the HTML and the HTML documents {{of a web}} site, SQL*TextRetrieval is used to index full text and other structured data in the 'web space'and to provide an efficient search engine for free-text search. The Web enables global access to and maximum information sharing with a hypertext-based text retrieval system. Using Oracle's Free Text Retrieval technology various search options are implemented, including basic word stemming, phrase, fuzzy, and soundex searching, {{as well as more}} advanced proximity search and concept search. For the concept search option, we have integrated a public domain "Roget Thesaurus" into our text search system to support synonym expansions. An advanced search mechanism to recursively refine search domain via the web is also described. The prototype system can be found at URL <[URL]...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there has}} been much {{research}} into intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), there are few authoring systems available that support ITS metaphors. Instructional developers are generally obliged to use tools designed for creating <b>on-line</b> <b>books.</b> We are currently developing an authoring environment derived from NASA's research on intelligent computer-aided training (ICAT). The ICAT metaphor, currently in use at NASA has proven effective in disciplines from satellite deployment to high school physics. This technique provides a personal trainer (PT) who instructs the student using a simulated work environment (SWE). The PT acts as a tutor, providing individualized instruction and assistance to each student. Teaching in an SWE allows the student to learn tasks by doing them, rather than by reading about them. This authoring environment will expedite ICAT development by providing a tool set that guides the trainer modeling process. Additionally, this environment provides a vehicle for distributing NASA's ICAT technology to the private sector...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how we {{can create}} dynamic and interactive on-line documents in Portable Document Format (PDF), using TEX. PDF documents are generally device and platform independent, therefore, ideally suited for on-line publishing and information exhange. We will need to work in three programming languages: macros in TEX, and definitions in PostScriptand PDF. We begin by describing the steps necessary to process PDF through TEXand PostScript, followed by several examples of defining such TEX macros. The examples are quite easy to follow; however, some knowledge of PostScript and PDF programming is useful. Paperless publishing Publishing of books and documents has dramatically changed {{in the past few}} decades. Philip Taylor (1996) accurately described the emergence of computer typesetting with emphasis on Web document rendering applications, using portable multiplatform hypertext exchange standards, particularly focusing on the merits of PDF and HTML (including XML, SGML, et al.). For our purpose we can define on-line as any means by which a document can be electronically rendered; this is perhaps more aptly called paperless printing. The popularity of <b>on-line</b> <b>books</b> and documents has spawned a diverse variety of on-line readers. These readers, for our purpose, are programs, applets, and interpreters which can read electronic data and output the image to a screen, {{in much the same way}} that one would see the output from a printer. Readers include proprietary single-platform programs, stand-alone multi-platform readers (includin...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : We {{introduce}} a fully-automated method that, given any concept, discovers an exhaustive vocabulary explaining all its appearance variations (i. e., actions, interactions, attributes, etc.), and trains full-fledged detection models for it. This figure shows {{a few of}} the many variations that our method has learned for four different classes of concepts: object (horse), scene (kitchen), event (Christmas), and action (walking). Recognition is graduating from labs to real-world ap-plications. While it is encouraging to see its potential being tapped, it brings forth a fundamental challenge to the vision researcher: scalability. How can we learn a model for any concept that exhaustively covers all its appearance varia-tions, while requiring minimal or no human supervision for compiling the vocabulary of visual variance, gathering the training images and annotations, and learning the models? In this paper, we {{introduce a}} fully-automated approach for learning extensive models {{for a wide range of}} variations (e. g. actions, interactions, attributes and beyond) within any concept. Our approach leverages vast resources of <b>on-line</b> <b>books</b> to discover the vocabulary of variance, and in-tertwines the data collection and modeling steps to alleviate the need for explicit human supervision in training the mod-els. Our approach organizes the visual knowledge about a concept in a convenient and useful way, enabling a variety of applications across vision and NLP. Our online system has been queried by users to learn models for several inter-esting concepts including breakfast, Gandhi, beautiful, etc. To date, our system has models available for over 50, 000 variations within 150 concepts, and has annotated more than 10 million images with bounding boxes. 1...|$|E
