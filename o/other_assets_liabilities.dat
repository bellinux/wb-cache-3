40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} U. S. corporations' management of their pension plans and their management of the more familiar aspects of corporate financial structure. The chief conclusion, {{on the basis of}} data for 7, 828 pension plans sponsored by 1, 836 companies and their subsidiaries, is that corporations do not manage the pension plans which they sponsor as if these plans {{had nothing to do with}} the corporation. Different responses appear to characterize firms' behavior in different contexts, but the evidence persistently indicates clear relationships between decisions about pension <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> and decisions about the <b>other</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> of the firm. At the same time, the pattern of these relation- ships is, more often than not, inconsistent with familiar hypotheses that have emerged thus far in the theoretical literature analyzing pension aspects of corporate finance. Hence the conclusion from the data is also that the connections between pension decisions and corporate financial decisions in the more conventional sense are, at least as yet, not well understood. ...|$|R

30|$|Before {{turning to}} an example and to {{empirical}} evidence {{to clarify the}} issue, two comments are worth making at this stage. First, the above discussion only talks about credit and deposits. If these are the only items on banks’ balance sheets, {{there should be a}} full correlation between these two variables. But there are <b>other</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> on commercial banks’ balance sheets, which naturally weakens the link between loans and deposits. For example, loans can be matched by non-deposit liabilities or by a decline in <b>other</b> <b>assets.</b> The second comment is about the Bank of England article by McLeay et al. (2014). Even though this article is supposed to clarify the issues related to money creation, its ambiguous wording is actually creating more confusion. The article is very much in the line of Tobin (1963) that integrates the two perspectives on money creation mentioned above. However, the way the first pages of the article are written initially gives the impression that only banks determine the amount of deposits through their loans. This is the reason why supporters of monetary mysticism cite McLeay et al. (2014) as supporting their view. But this is not the basic message of that article.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some positive}} and normative {{aspects of the}} inflation indexation {{of public and private}} pensions. The analysis shows that alternative indexing arrangements may have far less impact on actual patterns of risk bearing than is usually thought to be the case. In so far as inflation indexing has real effects, there is no presumption that they are beneficial. In particular, the pre—commitment aspects of public indexing may not be efficient. There are sound reasons to believe that voluntarily agreed on, non—indexed private pensions may well be efficient. Non—indexed pensions may result in an efficient allocation of risks given the <b>other</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> of pension issuers and beneficiaries. In this case, indexation would impede the efficient allocation of risks. In this paper is also developed an ICOLI (interteinporal cost of living index) which is superior to conventional price indices as a way of evaluating the changes in real well being, associated with changes in wealth. The use of this measure has significant implications for the indexation of pensions, and for the question of what assets should be held in pension portfolios...|$|R
40|$|A new {{proposal}} by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for setting {{the amount of}} capital banks must hold against potential losses from interest rate risk uses only a few, very stylized scenarios. Analysis shows the proposed scenarios are extremely unlikely to occur. While they may be appropriate for setting bank capital guidelines, they are much less relevant for everyday risk management. Instead, using a modeling framework with a plausible range of interest rate scenarios would be more relevant to help banks manage their interest rate risk. One of the main risks banks must account for is interest rate fluctuations, along with the associated changes in the values of their <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities.</b> While interest rate risk is certainly more immediate for marketable securities such as government or corporate bonds, <b>other</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> that are not generally marked-to-market each day are also subject to interest rate risk. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed setting bank capital guidelines for this risk according to some stylized techniques (see BCBS 2015). In this Economic Letter, we assess some of these proposals {{in the context of}} the probability-based stress-testing framework developed by Christensen, Lopez, and Rudebusch (2015). We find that the BCBS proposals can provide some basic insights into managing interest rate risk and might be appropriate for setting regulatory capital standards.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of fair value {{measurement}} by 228 listed companies in the UK and Australia {{around the time of}} adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005. We test whether within and between country comparability in policy choices (as measured by T indices) has changed in relation to (a) mandatory and (b) optional use of fair value measurement. Mandatory requirements related to financial instruments (IAS 39) and share-based payments (IFRS 2) have increased comparability, with a weaker effect for biological assets (IAS 41). In relation to the optional use of fair value, comparability increased in relation to property (IAS 16) because some companies discontinued fair value measurement. Under IAS 39, the fair value option for <b>other</b> financial <b>assets</b> and <b>other</b> financial <b>liabilities</b> decreased comparability. Options to use fair value in <b>other</b> areas (intangible <b>assets,</b> plant and equipment and investment properties) are not generally taken up, either for on-going measurement or on IFRS adoption (under the 'deemed cost' option). The results suggest a conservative approach and/or lack of incentives to use fair value measurement for most companies. Exceptions include some banks and insurance companies (for <b>other</b> financial <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities)</b> and companies holding investment properties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{intellectual}} capital (IC) paradigm {{appears to be}} stuck at a crossroads of relevance. This paper aims to explore a way forward by examining the power of IC narratives. The prevailing use of narrative as {{an explanation for the}} reasons underpinning an organisation's management of IC is too narrow since narrative can have an emancipatory impact. This enhanced view of narrative allows the opportunity to explore how narrative may be used to understand and mobilise IC both inside and outside organisations and thus improve its relevance as a working discipline. Design/methodology/approach – An analysis of three case studies is presented, each offering different insights on the emancipatory potential of IC narratives. Findings – In order to progress IC beyond the crossroads of relevance, organisations should not blindly implement “frameworks” or “guidelines” that seek to measure and control IC as if it were any <b>other</b> <b>asset</b> (or <b>liability).</b> Instead organisations may benefit from considering how the development of IC fits with the strategic intent of the organisation and be proactive, thinking beyond “accepted” practice to create new insights through critical reflection. Originality/value – The paper is novel because it extends the understanding of how IC can be utilised by providing exemplars of a failed IC implementation as well as two cases where the implementation of IC has brought benefits. Thus, we see IC in action, rather than from a distance. 32 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} COIC's {{experience}} with deposit-taking institutions during the 1980 s and 1990 s and presents {{a number of}} early warning indicators of financial distress. Early warning indicators do not eliminate bank failures. However, they should lead to early intervention and consequently help reduce losses to deposit insurance funds or governments. To be effective, early warning indicators {{should be used in}} conjunction with professional judgement. Judgement must be exercised in choosing the relevant indicators and in interpreting the data derived from the early warning measures. The effectiveness of an early warning indicator also depends {{on the quality of the}} data. For example, many deposit-taking institutions that failed in Canada had inadequate information systems that generated unreliable data. The inaccurate data led management (and regulators) to believe the institution was healthy, resulted in poor decision making, delayed intervention by regulatory agencies, and eventually led to failure. Also, traditional cost valuation methods for preparing accounting information may not be appropriate for early warning data. For example, a "marked-to-market" valuation of <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> of financial institutions can lead to sounder decision making and is more appropriate for assets such as marketable securities and derivativei products. Furthermore, for an early warning indicator to be effective, indicators need to be supplemented by information that is not of a financial nature. On-site examinations provide crucial first-hand information onmanagement's strategy and competence, the adequacy of internal controls and the accuracy of financial reporting. Moreover, macro- and micro-economic data, market trend indicators (i. e., real estate values, stock market indices) and industry-specific data can explain how external forces have affected the institution in the past and how they can affect it in the future. Finally, early warning systems must cover all the key functions of a bank's operations and potential areas of risk, namely (among many others) internal audit, cash management and liquidity, securities operations, loan portfolio, <b>other</b> <b>assets,</b> deposit <b>liabilities,</b> capital adequacy, profit and loss and market risks, This paper provides early warning signs and indicators for the above dimensions. ...|$|R
