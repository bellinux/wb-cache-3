5|$|On 29 April a South Vietnamese armored {{task force}} crossed the Cambodian border {{into the area}} known as the Parrot's Beak, {{northwest}} of Saigon. The following day a multi-division U.S./South Vietnamese force rolled over the border and into the area known as the Fishhook, north of Saigon and opposite Binh Long Province. With the exception of heavy fighting at the town of Snoul, PAVN/NLF resistance was light {{since most of the}} North Vietnamese had been withdrawn from the border regions for operations against FANK. In quick succession, all of the border sanctuaries were struck, to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> by U.S. or South Vietnamese forces.|$|E
5|$|When the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, Lukačević {{became a}} leader of Chetniks in the Sandžak region and joined the {{movement}} of Draža Mihailović. While the Chetniks were an anti-Axis movement in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, they also pursued almost throughout the war a tactical or selective collaboration with the occupation authorities against the Yugoslav Partisans. They engaged {{in cooperation with the}} Axis powers to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> by establishing modi vivendi or operating as auxiliary forces under Axis control. Lukačević himself collaborated extensively with the Italians and the Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans until mid-1944.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

60|$|The Arundel Castle is {{the finest}} boat I {{have seen in}} these seas. She is {{thoroughly}} modern, and that statement covers {{a great deal of}} ground. She has the usual defect, the common defect, the universal defect, the defect that has never been missing from any ship that ever sailed--she has imperfect beds. Many ships have good beds, but no ship has very good ones. In the matter of beds all ships have been badly edited, ignorantly edited, from the beginning. The selection of the beds is given to some hearty, strong-backed, self-made man, when it ought to be given to a frail woman accustomed from girlhood to backaches and insomnia. Nothing is so rare, {{on either side of the}} ocean, as a perfect bed; nothing is so difficult to make. Some of the hotels on both sides provide it, but no ship ever does or ever did. In Noah's Ark the beds were simply scandalous. Noah set the fashion, and it will endure in <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> of modification <b>or</b> <b>another</b> till the next flood.|$|R

5|$|While the Chetniks were an anti-Axis {{movement}} in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, they also carried out almost {{throughout the war}} a tactical or selective collaboration with the occupation authorities against the Partisans. The Chetnik movement adopted a policy of collaboration with the Axis powers, and engaged in cooperation to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> by establishing modus vivendi or operating as auxiliary forces under Axis control. This was demonstrated in late 1942 and early 1943, when Ostojić planned and oversaw the Chetnik involvement in the large Axis anti-Partisan offensive Case White alongside Italian troops. In 1944, he became {{a leader of the}} Chetnik forces in Herzegovina, and along with Dobroslav Jevđević was involved in attempts {{to come to terms with}} the Allied forces. In late 1944, as the Partisans tightened their grip on the country and the Soviet Red Army captured Belgrade, he re-joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia but they could not agree on what course of action to take. Ostojić, along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Petar Baćović and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić decided to move west to the area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern-day Slovenia where other friendly forces were concentrating. In early April 1945, faced with attacks by the Partisans and the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along their route, the combined Chetnik force was defeated by HOS forces in the Battle of Lijevče Field, after which Ostojić was captured by the Ustaše in an apparent trap. According to some sources, he was killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp alongside Đurišić, Baćović and Vasić.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the most}} famous studies of the {{demographics}} of human sexual orientation were Dr. Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953). These studies used a seven-point spectrum to define sexual behavior, from 0 for completely heterosexual to 6 for completely homosexual. Kinsey concluded that {{a small percentage of the}} population were to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> bisexual (falling on the scale from 1 to 6). He also reported that 37% of men in the U.S. had achieved orgasm through contact with another male after adolescence and 13% of women had achieved orgasm through contact with another woman.|$|E
25|$|God-fearers are {{considered}} to be of significant importance to the popularity of the Early Christian movement. They represented a group of gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> However, they were not converts, but a separate gentile community, engaged in Judaic religious ideas and practices. Actual conversion to Judaism would require adherence to all of the Laws of Moses, which includes various prohibitions (kashrut, circumcision, Sabbath observance etc.) which were generally unattractive to would-be gentile (largely Greek) converts. The rite of circumcision was especially unpopular in Classical civilization because it was the custom to spend an hour a day or so exercising in the nude in the gymnasium and males {{did not want to be}} seen in public deprived of their foreskins.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the duties}} of the Czech President can be said to be {{ceremonial}} to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the Prime Minister. A good example of this is the status as {{commander in chief of the}} military. No part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the Prime Minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the president to do with respect to the military is to appoint its generalsbut even this must be done with the signature of the Prime Minister.|$|E

25|$|Living {{and working}} {{conditions}} in the camps varied significantly across time and place, depending, among other things, {{on the impact of}} broader events (World War II, countrywide famines and shortages, waves of terror, sudden influx or release of large numbers of prisoners). However, to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meager food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labor. In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanization of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.|$|E

500|$|Seminal {{though this}} moment was, {{it was just}} a start. As his biographer, WK Hancock, noted: [...] "All the same, [...] knew that nations are not made by {{administrative}} arrangements alone". In The Conditions of Future South African Literature, his next essay of significance, he dealt with the other significant factor in nation-building - the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community. Within this essay, not at first sight written on an overtly political topic, Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born. The question then arose - what was hindering this development? Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer - particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population. The relations between these two groups were fraught; the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population. With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant economic unit of South Africa, but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest, with the established population decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers. These divisions, though strongest in the Transvaal, existed to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> throughout South Africa. Smuts, though sympathising with the concerns of the old population, fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration, urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting. Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old, to consolidate the white population both {{for the sake of a}} future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population.|$|E
2500|$|It can be thus {{understood}} why during Early Christian times there existed groups of Godfearers, who were gentiles who shared religious ideas with Jews, to <b>one</b> <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> but {{were afraid to}} circumcise, and were not recognized as Jews.|$|E

50|$|Tieflings were {{originally}} introduced as humans with demonic ancestry, whose lineage {{can be traced}} back to some <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> to that of a fiend or demon within the Dungeons & Dragons universe.

3000|$|So far, then, our authors {{understand}} experimentation as {{a willingness}} to try something new, a focus on agency, a grounding in sense experience and an appeal to everyday practice, and being situated in and relevant to vernacular sensibilities.
