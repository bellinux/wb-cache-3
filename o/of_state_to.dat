5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing the head <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E

5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, {{and because he}} was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world.
