In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in {{what became known as}} the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in {{what became known as the}} Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was critical in the ensuing civil war, since it was the major industrial and oil refinery port in British Palestine.|$|E
5|$|King Andriamasinavalona (16751710), {{also known}} as Andrianjakanavalondambo, was a King of Imerina in the central {{highlands}} of Madagascar. He made significant and enduring contributions to the social, political and economic life of Imerina. Chief among these was the expansion of his territories and the pacification and unification of certain principalities that had become locked in violent conflict; Andriamasinavalona established and ruled over the largest extent of the Kingdom of Imerina. He gave the name of Antananarivo to the capital city that was rapidly expanding around the royal palace on the hill of Analamanga, created a large public square at Andohalo <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the city, and named a series of other locations within the city. He also took possession of a distant hill he renamed Ambohimanga as a lodging for his son Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana; the royal city that developed there has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} the ancient city are of little {{interest}} as ruins, but indicate {{the existence of a}} considerable town; among them are the vestiges of an amphitheatre, a theatre, and thermae, all of them located <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the modern city. About 3km from the city, at the foot of Monte Morrone, are some ruins of reticulated masonry, traditionally believed to be Ovid's villa. Today, they are more properly identified as the sanctuary of Hercules Curinus. Nearby is the Badia Morronese, a large (c. 119 × 140m) religious complex located near Pope Celestine V's hermitage. It was founded by Celestine as a chapel in 1241, and was enlarged and later made into a convent.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{original}} attractions are <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which {{would no longer be}} considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.|$|E

25|$|Like {{his uncle}} Maurice, William now felt {{he needed to}} save the Union, if need be by force. In {{collusion}} with his colleague-stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen, Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz (a cousin in the cadet branch of the House of Orange-Nassau), he embarked on a campaign of intimidation of the Holland regents that would ultimately lead {{to the use of}} force. On July 30, 1650, William had six leading Holland regents arrested in The Hague (where the States General met), while Willem Frederik attempted to take the city of Amsterdam by surprise with federal troops. Though this coup de main failed and Amsterdam managed to keep the troops <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> the city was sufficiently intimidated to give in to William's demands to purge his opponents from the Amsterdam city council. The States of Holland then capitulated and rescinded its order to disband the troops. The theory of provincial supremacy was disavowed also.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{program of}} {{lend-lease}} {{was extended to}} Soviet Union in September 1941, supplying planes, tanks, trucks and other war materials. Eventually the Soviets managed to slow the Wehrmacht's blitzkrieg, halting the Nazi offensive in December 1941 <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of Moscow, in part because mobilized troops with winterized clothing from Siberia were transferred from there after Stalin realized that Japan {{was not going to}} attack the Soviet Union (Japan had just attacked Pearl Harbor). The Red Army launched a powerful winter counteroffensive which pushed the Germans back from the outskirts of Moscow. At the start of 1942, the weakened Axis armies abandoned their march on Moscow and advanced south towards the Caucasus and Volga river. This offensive, in turn, ran out of steam in autumn 1942, allowing the Soviet forces to stage a devastating counteroffensive on the overextended enemy. The Red Army encircled and destroyed significant German forces at the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended in February 1943 and reversed the tide of the war in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, {{ordered the}} {{execution}} of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabríz from Chihríq, so that he could be shot by a firing squad. On the morning of July 9, 1850, the Báb was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch. The Báb and a companion were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot. After the order was given to shoot and the smoke cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. The soldiers subsequently found the Báb {{in another part of the}} barracks, completely unharmed. He was tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. Their remains were dumped <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the town to be eaten by animals.|$|E

25|$|In {{the face}} of the large Imperial host, the weaker French army of Marshal Catinat fell back, but not before {{reinforcing}} Landau with two battalions of Royal Artillery. Landau was defended by the 72-year-old Lieutenant General Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac who commanded a garrison of 4,095 infantry and 240 cavalrymen. Mélac was notorious for his brutal devastation of the Palatinate in 1688. Aside from the gunners, Mélac's force consisted of two battalions of the Nettancourt Infantry Regiment, one battalion each of the Sarre, Bourbon and Soissonaise Infantry Regiments, two squadrons of the Forsac Cavalry Regiment and the Mélac Free Company. The free company was composed of enemy deserters. Mélac's deputy was Brigadier de l'Esperoux, the infantry commander was Brigadier d'Amigny, the artillery officer was du Breuil, the engineer officer was Villars and the commander of the Crownwork was Lieutenant Colonel Colomes. After the fortress was surrounded, a number of officers who had been on leave tried to slip through the investment to join their units inside the fortress. On 18 May, Brigadier de Guesques and Colonel de Nettancourt were captured by Palatine cavalry just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates.</b> D'Amigny successfully sneaked in on 16 June disguised as a peasant. During the siege the Nettancourt Regiment was led by Colonel de Gournay.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, 1850, the Báb {{was taken to the}} {{courtyard}} of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of Christian soldiers prepared to shoot. Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result. The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb {{in another part of the}} barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary. He and Anis were tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad of Muslim soldiers was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. In Bábí and Bahá'í tradition, the failure of the first firing squad to kill the Báb is believed to have been a miracle. Their remains were dumped <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the town to be eaten by animals.|$|E
