5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E

5|$|AD {{may also}} impair LTP through {{mechanisms}} distinct from Aβ. For example, <b>one</b> <b>study</b> {{demonstrated that the}} enzyme PKMζ accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles, which are a pathologic marker of AD. PKMζ is an enzyme with critical importance in the maintenance of late LTP.|$|E
5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males {{have been found to be}} more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding {{was associated with the}} preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. In <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> angioedema appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting aspirin {{in some of the}} people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.|$|E
5|$|Aware of Simonsohn's {{critical}} {{analyses of}} their earlier methods, Pelham and Mauricio published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In <b>one</b> <b>study</b> they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.|$|E
5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla).|$|E

5|$|DNA {{studies have}} {{identified}} close genetic relationships between Limousin cattle and other south-west European breeds. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> reported a possible common origin or recent gene flow between the Limousin and Charolais cattle breeds. whereas other studies {{indicated that a}} closer genetic relationship exists between Limousin, Gasconne, Aubrac, Bazadais, Salers, and Blonde d'Aquitaine cattle.|$|E
5|$|Data on nesting {{success rates}} is limited; <b>one</b> <b>study</b> of 35 nests found 28 (80%) {{resulted}} in the fledging {{of at least one}} young currawong. Causes of failure included nest collapse by gale-force winds and rain, and harassment and nest raiding by pied currawongs. The incidence of brood parasitism is uncertain. A pair of grey currawongs have been observed feeding a channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) chick on one occasion.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} studies, it is {{not known}} whether {{increased}} fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness, and there is a similar lack of data for the use of heated humidified air. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> has found chest vapor rub to provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In <b>one</b> <b>study</b> synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of dugong {{predation}} {{was identified}} in <b>one</b> <b>study</b> that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly {{to those of}} known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.|$|E

5|$|For some people, aspirin {{does not}} have as strong an effect on {{platelets}} as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> has suggested {{women are more likely}} to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.|$|E
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions.

25|$|The Mishneh Torah was {{strongly}} opposed {{almost as soon}} as it appeared. Major sources of contention were the absence of sources and the belief that the work appeared to be intended to supersede study of the Talmud.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to translate the refined version of the Passion Scale (Marsh et al. 2013) in Chinese and test its validity and reliability. To do so, we first translated the Passion Scale in Chinese using back-translation procedures (Vallerand 1989). After a pilot study suggesting that the Passion Scale in Chinese was acceptable, university students completed an online questionnaire. This questionnaire contained the Passion Scale toward <b>one’s</b> <b>studies,</b> the passion criteria (for e.g. “my studies are passion for me”), as well as the level of flow and positive and negative emotions experienced when engaging in <b>one’s</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R
