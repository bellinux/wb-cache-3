5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found to}} be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

50|$|Indirect {{costs are}} costs {{that are not}} {{directly}} accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function <b>or</b> product). <b>Indirect</b> costs may be either fixed <b>or</b> variable. <b>Indirect</b> costs include administration, personnel and security costs. These are those costs which are {{not directly related to}} production. Some indirect costs may be overhead. But some overhead costs can be directly attributed to a project and are direct costs.|$|R
5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Ohio {{was ranked}} #1 in the Midwest and 4th {{in the nation}} for biotech {{industry}} strength by Business Facilities magazine. As of 2008, there were over 1,100 biotech related firms operating in the state, employing 1.4 million residents overall in direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> related fields, including healthcare, with $2.5 billion in investment in 2007, making it an international leader. Ohio had three city-regions in the top 30 biotech locations in the country, with Cleveland-Akron ranked #20, Columbus #22, and Cincinnati #28.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 36 sports, 51 {{disciplines}} and 364 medal events were contested in these Games. Basque pelota {{was the only}} sport dropped from the last games. Golf (after being added to the Olympic program for 2016) also made its Pan American Games debut. Canoe slalom, the only Olympic discipline never to have been held at the Games, also made its debut, meaning {{for the first time}} the entire Olympic sports program was contested. Furthermore, both canoe disciplines had C-1 events for women for the first time. Women's baseball and women's rugby sevens also made their debuts, with men's softball returning to the program, after last being contested in 2003. A total of 19 sports (the most ever) were direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> (such as opportunities to gain qualification times) qualifiers for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's {{territory}} lay {{in what is}} now Scotland {{south of}} the River Forth, a multi-ethnic region during the late 12th century. North of the Forth was the Gaelic kingdom of Scotland (Alba), which under its partially Normanised kings exercised direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> control over most of the region to the south as far as the borders of Northumberland and Cumberland. Lothian and the Merse were the heartlands of {{the northern part of the}} old English Earldom of Northumbria, and in the late 12th century the people of these regions, as well as the people of Lauderdale, Eskdale, Liddesdale, and most of Teviotdale and Annandale, were English in language and regarded themselves as English by ethnicity, despite having been under the control of the king of the Scots for at least a century.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E

5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special eye protection, <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.|$|E

5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on {{blue and white}} panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that {{a significant portion of the}} population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient <b>or</b> <b>indirect</b> object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|Like many ex-Army officers, {{he tended}} to see air power in the {{tactical}} role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for neglecting strategic bombing while over-focusing on close air support for the army. However the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct <b>or</b> <b>indirect)</b> were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. The two men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel like Kesselring. Interdiction and close air support were operations that suited the Luftwaffe's pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient in power for use in strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; Britain and France.|$|E
