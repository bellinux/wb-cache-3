5|$|Carbon dating on ash mounds {{associated}} with Neolithic cultures in South India {{date back to}} 8000BCE. Artefacts such as ground stone axes, and minor copper objects {{have been found in}} the region. Towards the beginning of 1000BCE, iron technology spread through the region; however, there {{does not appear to be}} a fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India. The region was in the middle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean and East Asia. Trade with Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, Jews and Chinese began from the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BC to c. 4th century AD). The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the Asian continent in the East and the West.|$|E
5|$|During {{the offseason}} that followed, the new Red Sox {{ownership}} (led by John W.

However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, rather ironically as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} after this first wave of {{destruction}} a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to {{have been involved in}} an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> embargo imposed on Assyria. In general, {{in the second half of}} 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.|$|E

5|$|Lazica {{had been}} a Byzantine client state since 522, when its king, Tzath I, had {{rejected}} Persian hegemony. However, during the rule of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), a series of heavy-handed Byzantine measures made them unpopular. In particular, the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly by the magister militum (general) John Tzibus, which was regulated from the newly constructed fortress of Petra, drove Gubazes to seek once again {{the protection of the}} Persian shah, Khosrau I (r. 531–579).|$|E

5|$|After a long tenure on Monday nights, Keibler and Christy Hemme, {{were moved}} to SmackDown! on August 25, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> that brought Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle to Raw. On SmackDown! Keibler participated in {{lingerie}} matches and bikini contests. After a short absence, Keibler began a short feud with Jillian Hall, {{which led to the}} two having a match on Velocity, which Keibler lost. This would be Keibler's final match with WWE. Keibler then asked for time off to appear on Dancing with the Stars. During this time, Keibler's WWE.com profile was moved from SmackDown! to RAW, though she never made an appearance on the brand before leaving the company. Keibler's final mention on WWE programming occurred on the March 6, 2006 episode of RAW, where she was insulted by Candice Michelle for placing third on Dancing with the Stars during Michelle's unveiling of her Playboy magazine cover. After completing her stint on Dancing with the Stars, Keibler officially parted ways with WWE in July 2006 to move on to other endeavors.|$|E

5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2016–17 season, the Hawks {{extended}} Hardaway a qualifying offer, {{making him}} a restricted free agent (giving the Hawks the right to match any offer that he signed). On July 6, 2017, Hardaway received a four-year, $71 million offer sheet from the Knicks; Atlanta had 48 hours to match the offer or lose Hardaway. The contract of $16.50M, $17.32M, $18.15M and $18.97M has a player option in year 4 and includes a 15% bonus of outstanding year 1 through 3 salary in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade.</b> The Hawks declined to match the offer, and Hardaway signed with the Knicks on July 8. Hardaway began the season in the starting lineup. On October 29, 2017, he scored a game-high 34 points in a 114–95 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. On November 8, 2017, with Kristaps Porzingis sidelined, Hardaway posted his first NBA career double-double with a game-high 26 points and 11 rebounds against the Orlando Magic.|$|E
5|$|The first Labor {{party in}} South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, born out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>trade</b> union {{association}} that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL {{combined with the}} Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union, later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP morphed into the Australian Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E
