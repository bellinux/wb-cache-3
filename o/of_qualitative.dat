5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} in the health sciences has had to overcome many prejudices {{and a number of}} misunderstandings, but today qualitative research is as acceptable as quantitative research designs and is widely funded and published. Writing the proposal <b>of</b> a <b>qualitative</b> study, however, can be a challenging feat, due to the emergent nature <b>of</b> the <b>qualitative</b> research design and the description of the methodology as a process. Even today, many sub-standard proposals at post-graduate evaluation committees and application proposals to be considered for funding are still seen. This problem has led the researcher to develop a framework to guide the qualitative researcher in writing the proposal <b>of</b> a <b>qualitative</b> study based on the following research questions: (i) What is the process <b>of</b> writing a <b>qualitative</b> research proposal? and (ii) What does the structure and layout <b>of</b> a <b>qualitative</b> proposal look like? The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss the process <b>of</b> writing the <b>qualitative</b> research proposal, as well as describe the structure and layout <b>of</b> a <b>qualitative</b> research proposal. The process <b>of</b> writing a <b>qualitative</b> research proposal is discussed with regards to the most important questions that need to be answered in your research proposal with consideration of the guidelines of being practical, being persuasive, making broader links, aiming for crystal clarity and planning before you write. While the structure <b>of</b> the <b>qualitative</b> research proposal is discussed with regards to the key sections of the proposal, namely the cover page, abstract, introduction, review of the literature, research problem and research questions, research purpose and objectives, research paradigm, research design, research method, ethical considerations, dissemination plan, budget and appendices...|$|R

In this presentation researchers address how the distance-based connection could change the nature <b>of</b> the <b>qualitative</b> inquiry itself. Using an ongoing qualitative study exploring efficiency and retention in online environments as an example, presenters will involve the attendees in an interactive discussion about possibilities and limitations of a case study conducted in a distance-based University setting. Presenters will discuss the topics of the online-based IRB process, distance-based data collection, and distance-based researchers’ collaboration.
