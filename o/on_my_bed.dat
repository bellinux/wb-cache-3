2500|$|Indian bantamweight boxer Akhil Kumar's {{bed in the}} Games village {{collapsed}} when he sat on it. [...] "I {{sat down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> to rest but suddenly it gave way. After that I noticed {{that part of it}} has no plywood", he said ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse came to Burbank's studio one hot day, fanning {{himself with}} a big turkey wing. [...] "He sat down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> and, not noticing, put his hat down {{on a sheet of}} sticky flypaper I had placed there. To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with his other hand, and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|E

60|$|The {{composing}} {{influence of}} the fresh air in the garden had by this time made me readier to lie down and rest than to occupy my mind in reflecting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> difficulties. Little by little I grew too drowsy to think--then too lazy to go <b>on</b> walking. <b>My</b> <b>bed</b> looked wonderfully inviting as I passed by the open window of my room.|$|R
60|$|He mocked me {{with the}} {{senseless}} refrain in an ear-jangling falsetto. Without doubt I had bawled the nonsense out <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way to <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{last one}} day Checco {{came to me}} and threw himself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|My head reeled, for by {{the faint}} night-lamp, I saw {{stretched}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> the old phantom--the NUN.|$|E
60|$|No! I {{lie down}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and I {{discover}} {{that there is}} no rest for me that night.|$|E
60|$|I {{have never}} in my life {{experienced}} a gloomier or more distressing camp <b>on</b> the trail. <b>My</b> <b>bed</b> was dry and warm, but I could not forget our tired horses grubbing about in the chilly night on that desolate marsh.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, I am in earnest, dear. There is Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt {{is almost}} {{the richest man in}} the whole world. Now, if I were <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dying <b>bed,</b> I could say to you that not even he has two in his drawing-room. Why, he hasn't even one--I wish I may die in my tracks if it isn't true.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he said decidedly, 'not after this. When I {{spoke to}} my father that Sunday evening, he {{unlocked}} his desk and gave me this, which I had not seen since I remember playing with it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>bed.</b> You will wear it, dearest. You will let me have the pleasure of knowing you have it on.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then we parted, and {{too tired}} even to wonder any more, I threw myself down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> and slept.|$|E
60|$|On this {{particular}} occasion I made my barricade stronger than usual; sat down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> {{and opened the}} packet from home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be quiet, you ass!... Squattez-vous on the floor, then!... I swear you aren't {{going to}} sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed!...</b> Mind the tooth-glass," [...] etc.|$|E
60|$|Thus I mused, {{and thus}} I questioned, tossing and turning <b>on</b> <b>my</b> inhospitable hard <b>bed,</b> until merciful sleep laid her quieting {{hands on the}} strings of my brain, and hushed their weary jangling.|$|R
5000|$|Horton began {{gymnastics}} {{at the age}} of four in 1990. [...] "I was a wild child", Horton said, [...] "I once {{climbed a}} pole in the middle of Target {{all the way to the}} ceiling. I used to do back flips <b>on</b> <b>my</b> parents' <b>bed</b> and I rode a garage door to the top when I was 3 years old." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tucker died in Monaco in 1939, in {{the company}} of his family. His daughter, Oriole, reported, [...] "Father's {{attitude}} towards communism never changed one whit, nor about religion... In his last months he called in the French housekeeper. 'I want her,' he said, 'to be a witness that <b>on</b> <b>my</b> death <b>bed</b> I'm not recanting. I do not believe in God!" ...|$|R
60|$|They're back. Dan {{is lying}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> I'll try {{and tell you}} his story as near as I can, in his own words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go into my room, lieutenant," [...] he {{suggested}} urgently. [...] "Throw yourself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> We will {{get something to}} ease you in a minute." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{gave up the}} struggle. In dull, stupid, obstinate despair, I threw myself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> {{and fell}} from sheer fatigue into a broken, uneasy sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, every {{thought that}} your heart has thought, Since the world came us between, The birds {{of the air}} to my heart have brought, With no word heard or seen." [...] 'Twas thus in a dream we spoke and said Myself and my love unseen, But I woke and sighed <b>on</b> <b>my</b> weary <b>bed,</b> For the spell of the juice of the bean! ...|$|R
60|$|By {{good fortune}} my {{money-box}} {{was not the}} weightiest of my grandfather's French trunks--not the brass-bound friend-in-need of my younger days, and it contained little but paper. I hoisted it <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and, as I had lately seen the porters do at the railway station, contrived to push under it and raise it <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> shoulder. Its edge drove in <b>on</b> <b>my</b> collar-bone till I thought it must snap. Thus laden, I staggered cautiously down the staircase, pushed slowly across the room, and, so, out into the passage and towards the rounded and dusky oblong of the open door.|$|R
6000|$|OEdip. Call louder, {{till you}} burst your airy forms!-- Rest <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hand. Thus, armed with innocence, I'll face these {{babbling}} dæmons of the air; In spite of ghosts, I'll <b>on.</b> Though round <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> the furies plant their charms, I'll break them, with Jocasta in my arms; Clasped {{in the folds}} of love, I'll wait my doom; And act my joys, though thunder shake the room. [...] [Exeunt.|$|R
60|$|When I got home, I threw myself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> {{and enjoyed}} a {{delightful}} sleep, and when I awoke felt cool and fresh, and very happy.|$|E
60|$|I {{arranged}} {{that this}} letter, which I took great pleasure in writing, {{should be left}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and discovered so soon as my flight was known.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} be quiet now, my dear fellow, after your dose; talking will only excite you. Settle {{yourself}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> and I'll be back in an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR SIR,--Walter {{who takes}} this will explain my wishes. Will you {{enable him to}} deliver my letter to Captain Medwin, and will you publish it? you are to give him ten pound for it; I will settle it with you. I am <b>on</b> <b>my</b> death <b>bed,</b> do not fail to obey my wishes. I send you my {{journals}} but do not publish them until I am dead.|$|R
60|$|I had {{suffered}} an accident which required a ticklish operation. One morning, {{a week after}} I had come off the table, I lay <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hospital <b>bed,</b> weak and weary. The sunburn of my face, what little of it could be seen through a scraggly growth of beard, had faded to a sickly yellow. My doctor stood at <b>my</b> bedside <b>on</b> the verge of departure. He glared disapprovingly at the cigarette I was smoking.|$|R
60|$|Above me, a steep black wall {{of granite}} rose sheer and {{straight}} towards the open heaven. Below me, I could hear, though I could not see, the lake of liquid fire hissing and bubbling with horrible noises in its eternal cauldron. Around, {{the floor was}} composed of solid dark green obsidian, as hard and transparent and sharp as bottle-glass. I must lie as best I could, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> uneasy <b>bed,</b> and brave it out for ten hours somehow.|$|R
6000|$|She yawned. Throwing herself without {{ceremony}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> she added, [...] "It seems Mademoiselle {{was nearly}} crushed to a jelly in a hubbub at the theatre some weeks ago." ...|$|E
60|$|I left Jacky peeking {{still and}} I went to bed. After {{a long time}} Aunt Tommy came {{up to my room}} and sat down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> in the moonlight.|$|E
6000|$|In {{darkness}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> alone [...] I {{seemed to}} see you in a vision, [...] And hear you say: [...] "Why this derision Of one drawn to you, though unknown?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad to hear}} you'll thank me, Mr. Glegg. It's little thanks I get {{for what}} I do for folks i' this world. Though there's never a woman o' your side o' the family, Mr. Glegg, as is fit to stand up with me, and I'd say it if I was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dying <b>bed.</b> Not but what I've allays {{conducted}} myself civil to your kin, and there isn't one of 'em can say the contrary, though my equils they aren't, and nobody shall make me say it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{cleared away}} ashes and rubbish, and marked out the very spot where Rima's {{separate}} bower {{had been for}} my habitation, which I intended to make small. In five days it was finished; then, after lighting a fire, I stretched myself out in <b>my</b> dry <b>bed</b> of moss and leaves with a feeling that was almost triumphant. Let the rain now fall in torrents, putting out the firefly's lamp; let the wind and thunder roar their loudest, and the lightnings smite the earth with intolerable light, frightening the poor monkeys in their wet, leafy habitations, little would I heed it all <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dry <b>bed,</b> under <b>my</b> dry, palm-leaf thatch, with glorious fire to keep me company and protect me from my ancient enemy, Darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "All I {{could think}} clearly {{was that the}} thing had to be carried through; the fixed idea still ruled me. And soon, for the money I had was almost exhausted. I looked about me at the hillside, with {{children}} playing and girls watching them, {{and tried to think}} of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world. After a time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of strychnine, and went to sleep in <b>my</b> clothes <b>on</b> <b>my</b> unmade <b>bed.</b> Strychnine is a grand tonic, Kemp, to take the flabbiness out of a man." ...|$|R
