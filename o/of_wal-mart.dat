25|$|Rationalization is also {{observable}} in {{the replacement}} of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case <b>of</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted considerable criticism for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations, due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the characteristics}} of the dormitory labour regime in China's post‐socialist period and the collusion of this regime in the process of the ‘Wal‐Martization’ of global toy production. This collusion has shaped labour relations and CSR labour practices in China. This paper focuses on three factories, located in the industrial zone of Shenzhen, South China, that supply toys to Wal‐Mart. It begins with an examination of the dormitory labour regime supporting China's exports and then investigates the ‘Wal‐Martization’ of the global toy industry. The effect <b>of</b> <b>Wal‐Mart's</b> bargain‐driven business model on the dormitory labour regime has reshaped China as ‘the world's workshop’ and changed its position in the international division of labour. An analysis of the nature and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Wal‐Mart's</b> corporate social responsibility (CSR) model, which is based on providing only the ‘legal minimum,’ and its impact on factory labour relations in China will follow. 本文试图揭示中国后社会主义时期宿舍劳动体制的逻辑， 并分析其与国际玩具行业生产的“沃尔玛化”是如何重塑中国劳动关系和改造企业社会责任的劳动实践。 本文来源于作者对中国深圳工业区三家沃尔玛玩具供应商工厂的研究。 首先， 我们试图将中国出口加工业区的宿舍劳动体制概念化， 并呈现世界玩具行业“沃尔玛化”的特质， 讨论沃尔玛“天天平价”的商业模式与中国宿舍劳动体制是如何相互结合、共同铸就中国“世界工厂”的地位以及在世界劳动分工体系中的位置。 最后我们对沃尔玛“合法最低主义”的企业社会责任模式进行批判并讨论其对于中国工厂劳动关系的影响。Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
