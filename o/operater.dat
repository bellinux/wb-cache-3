Therefore this study aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice of planting greenhouse operators in Yazd in regard with health hazards associated with pesticide use in 2012 - 2013. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study, which its population consisted of active nursery operators in Yazd. In this randomized study, 250 samples were selected out of 2233 greenhouse operators and then knowledge, attitudes and behavior of workers were measured using a questionnaire. After the study data were collected and codified, they ere entered into SPSS software. Moreover T-test and ANOVA tests were utilized to compare the average. Results: The results of the present study revealed that out of all greenhouse operators, 134 (6 / 53 %) had received pesticideuse training were trained. Education of 74 (29 %) of the <b>operaters</b> were reported at the initial level. Experience of 104 <b>operaters</b> (9 / 41 %) was revealed 6 - 10 years. 73 (2 / 29 %) of <b>operaters</b> aged between 25 and 35 years.

Finally the linear sta-bility problem is solved by numerical means, and quantitative results confirming the heuristic prediction are obtained. It is shown that the destabilization is {{not strong enough to}} maintain an unstable disturbance, and that the significant destabilization effects of Navier’s slip bound-ary condition are restricted to small values of the Reynolds number.

The factors leading to difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be predicted. Aims: To develop a scoring method that predicts difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Settings and Design: Bidirectional prospective study in a medical college setup. Materials and Methods: Following approval from the institutional ethical committee, cases from the three associated hospitals in a medical college setup, were collected using a detailed proforma stating the parameters of difficulty in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Study period was between May 10 and June 12. Preoperative, sonographic and intraoperative criteria were considered. Statistical Analysis Used: Chi Square test and Receiver <b>Operater</b> Curve (ROC) analysis. Results: Total 323 patients were included. On analysis, elderly patients, males, recurrent cholecystitis, obese patients, previous surgery, patients who needed preoperative Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), abnormal serum hepatic and pancreatic enzyme profiles, distended or contracted gall bladder, intra-peritoneal adhesions, structural anomalies or distortions and the presence of a cirrhotic liver on ultrasonography (USG) were identified as predictors of difficult LC.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the stress paths and consolidation history on the results of dynamic penetration tests and on the deformation behaviour of a sand, and the implications of the results on settlement predictions in granular material. For this purpose, specimens of saturated Leighton Buzzard sand were prepared in the laboratory inside a triaxial chamber 435 mm in diameter x 660 mm high, by sedimentation in water. After prestressing through different stress paths, dynamic penetration tests were performed on the specimens, penetration from each blow was recorded, and pore water pressure developed under the tip and at two different levels {{along the side of the}} penetrometer with elapsed time was measured by connecting the transducers inside the penetrometer to a system which enable a desk-top computer to store the results on cartridges with two channels. The results can be processed at any time using the same computer. Attempts to measure the acceleration and the velocity of the penetrometers were made by fixing an accelerometer inside the penetrometer and connecting it to the same system to be recorded and processed. High speed photography was used to find the elapsed time required for the penetrometer under each blow. The scale effect on the penetration resistance was examined by running tests using different sized penetrometers. In the second phase of testing a large number of stress path tests were carried out on the same sand having the same density under computer control in Bishop Wesley cell, following the stress paths used in the large triaxial chamber. At the end of each stress path a standard increment of sigmav' = 100 kN/m 2, sigmah' = 30 kN/m 2 was applied to simulate the stress increase on an element of soil beneath a foundation. Vertical strains under this standard increment were used to calculate a tangent deformation modulus (Mt) where Mt = Different available laboratory methods were tried to find the value of the coefficient of earth pressure at rest (KO) for the same sand at same density.

40|$|The {{condition}} of {{a fishing boat}} is very different between her departure and arrival, i. e., between outward and homeward voyage, during fishing operation, before and after transshipping of fish from catching boat to fish carrier, and therefore her motions are also different. This paper deals with the rolling, pitching and heaving motions of the response oscillation of the ship under various sea conditions. A series of field measurements were carried out on board three bull trawlers (No. 97 Choyo Maru, Nos. 23 and 51 Tokai Maru; 140 G. T.). The variation of each oscillation was recorded continuously for about 12 minutes in the 4 channel data recorder, while the sea conditions were observed by naked-eyes. The characters of oscillation such as rolling, pitching and vertical accelerations were obtained by the method of statistical analysis of the stochastic processes. Accordingly, the several substantial results are: 1) Although {{it is assumed that}} measured values of respective rolling, pitching and heaving motions under a certain sea condition are much the same, different values were observed. For instance, the rolling values in the bow sea under the pitching values in the head sea fluctuated under same sea condition. 2) During a fishing operation period (about 3 hours) the change of three motions is very small. 3) The rolling and heaving motions of the fishing boat in the fishing operation are greater than those in the voyage. However, the pitching is less conversely. 4) The author found a comfort index from the result of the measurment of vertical acceleration. The greater is the comfort index, the comfort becomes worse. The comfort, based on the comfort index, {{is the best in the}} fishing commander's bed and then in wireless <b>operater's</b> bed. There is a tendency that the comfort becomes worse in proportion tothe distance from the center of the ship. 以西底曳網漁船の実船試験によって,Rolling, Pitchingおよび上下加速度についての統計的動揺特性は次の通りであった。 1. 目視観測による海況階級が等しく,波と船との各出合い角度別の 3 運動の動揺特性は,Head seaのとき, 2 回の計測結果ではRollingとHeavingは周期,振巾共に相違はないがPitchingは,周期は等しいが振巾は異なった。Bow seaのときは,Rollingの振巾が 3 回の計測で各々異なった値を示した。Beam seaのときは, 3 回の計測結果が 3 運動共に相違は少なかった。スペクトラムからPitchingにはRollingの固有周期が表われる。またHeavingのスペクトラムにはPitchingのスペクトラムの変動分がRollingのそれより多く含まれている。 2. 約 2 時間 30 分の一曳網中における 3 運動の動揺特性には時間の経過に伴なう変化は認められない。従って魚の入網効果による運動の変化は無視できる。 3. 操業中と航海中との運動の平均振巾値の比較は,Quartering seaの場合,RollingとHeavingは操業中の方が大きくPitchingはわずかながら航海中の方が大であった。 4. 船の乗心地指標を乗組員の各寝台で計測された上下加速度をもって比較した場合,最も良好であったのは船橋の漁撈長の寝台で,次いで通信長および船長の寝台であった。一般乗組員の寝台問では明らかな順序はつけ難いが船首に近い程悪い傾向が認められる...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} changes of {{agriculture}} in Japan after the war, has been the mechanization of farm operations. Several kinds of small tillers, worked by kerosene engine, have gradually become popular implements of our farms. Therefore, the present writer wants to analize the changes of labor management {{that appears to be}} influenced by the mechanization. But it was difficult to take out the pure effects of machines out of the actual farm managements, for they are the farthest from being able to be treated in the laboratory experiment. When we come to survey the actual farm managements, we often come across the phenomena in which the effects of many factors are intertwined. We can not differenciate them clearly. Then, we asked the Okayama Statistical Office of Agriculture and Forestry Department to allow us to use the basic data for the survey of rice production cost. Even though the data are not always suitable for our purpose, they seem to be the best that are available. Rearranging this basic data for our purpose, we could classify the surveyed farms into three groups which are selected throughout the Okayama Prefecture. According to this classification, there are three types of farm groups; the first (A, A 1 and A 2) is the large scale farms which are possesed of a small tiller, the second (B, B 1 and B 2) is the small scale farms which are not possesed of a small tiller but hire it; and the third (C, C 1 and C 2) is the small or medium scale farms which neither are possesed of nor hire a small tiller. Analyzing the differences among these farm groups, we can find the following trends. (See table 1 - 7) 1) Speaking on the differences of farm scale among three groups, A groups (A, A 1 and A 2) are larger than any other groups. 2) Speaking on the differences of commercial crops production among three groups, A groups are most devoted to them and the farms of B groups (B, B 1 and B 2) are usually the part-time ones. 3) As far as total. working hour for rice production per unit area is concerned, A groups are the least one of these three groups but the differences of working hour among them are relatively slight. 4) The working hour of woman as a family member is shorter in A groups than in other groups. The working hour of hired men, however, is longer in A groups than in other groups. It seems to express that the changes of <b>operater's</b> role in family farm have been affected by mechanization. 5) It is certain that the farms of A groups have the convenient machines and save their labor, but only a few kinds of operations for rice production are practiced by mechanical method and most parts of this operations are practiced by hand method. Therefore, even the farmers of A groups still have to do many hand work for his farm management and sometimes they devote intensive hand practice to their rice production...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Gestão de Recursos Humanos, Faculdade de Ciências Humanas e Sociais, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 This {{thesis is}} aimed {{to examine the}} {{relationships}} between leadership, organizational culture and performance {{in the context of}} non-profit organization management. The context of non-profit organizations is specifically worth attention because these organizations have to adopt different attitude to their stakeholders and different organizational strategies, compared to the corporate organizations. That makes the question of authentic guidance, and strong organizational culture even more important for non-profit organizations. The research was applied to international non-profit organization called AIESEC, and conducted in the international ambience, involving participants from Portugal and Ukraine. AIESEC is an international non-profit organization run by students and recent graduates with the main focus on international exchange, world issues, leadership and management. Portugal and Ukraine were chosen as main countries involved in this study, as the researcher worked in AIESEC in both countries and was familiar with the reality of organization in those countries. It was hypothesized that organizational performance in non-profit organizations is influenced by leadership and organizational culture, also that culture is a mediator in this relationship. Besides that, this is study was called to reveal the nature of leadership and of current and ideal organizational cultures in AIESEC in Ukraine and Portugal. The questionnaire was sent to participants via e-mail. 252 responses were received, however, 12 of these responses were ineligible due to several reasons: participants did not understand the guidelines for the questionnaires or did not speak English fluently enough. Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ) by Avolio and Walumbwa (2007) was used to assess the leadership perception. Participants were asked to think about their team leader and judge how frequently each statement fits his or her leadership style by responding to a 16 item questionnaire. For organizational culture the questionnaire developed by Cameron and Quinn (2000) with four types of organizational culture (Clan, Hierarchy, Market and Adhocracy) was selected. Cameron and Quinn’s OCAI was used to assess how participants perceive the current organizational culture compared to the preferred one. Participants were asked to assess six key dimensions of organizational culture, providing a picture of how, in participants’ point of view, the organization operates and what values characterize it. Participants were to rate their organization by responding to six questions and distributing 100 by the four alternatives proposed to assess the current and the preferred organizational culture. As for the organizational performance, the 5 -factor scale, retrieved from Ogbonna and Harris (2000) was used to assess how participants estimate the organizational performance in terms of customer satisfaction, sales growth, market share, competitive advantage and sales volume. The participants were asked to estimate each of the above-mentioned factors on the 0 to 100 scale. The measurers selected for this research are considered reliable as Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for overall model was over high as well as for each variable separately. Good results received allows us to say that the study satisfies the validity criteria. Participants of this study were 240 students-members of AIESEC organization, divided into two groups according to the country of origin, 120 members of AIESEC in Ukraine and 120 of AIESEC in Portugal. The participants were students of different universities of Ukraine and Portugal and from different cities of Ukraine and Portugal, aged from 19 to 26 years old. The data was analyzed using SPSS program 21. 0 version and AMOS program 22. 0 version. SPSS was used for descriptive statistics, validity and reliability check, exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis. AMOS program was used during path analysis when building a research model. The hypothesis based on Obgonnad and Harris’ (2000) study was confirmed, meaning that it was found that in non-profit organizations, leadership and organizational culture influence the performance, with organizational culture being the mediator of relationship between two phenomena. The hypotheses stating the differences between leadership style and organizational culture in AIESEC in Ukraine were confirmed as well, as findings state that transparent leadership style is more videspread in non-profit organizations in Portugal than in Ukraine. This research proved that non-profit organizations in Ukraine, namely AIESEC, tend to have Market and Hierarchy types of current organizationla cultures, while non-profit organizations in Portugal are more likely to <b>operater</b> within Clan and Adhocracy current organizational culture. The expectations of ideal organizational culture of Portuguese and Ukrainian respondents corresponded with the current culture in organizations, meaning that non-profit organization members in Portugal see the Clan culture as ideal, while Ukrainian participants see it a Hierarchy type. This thesis is unique is its way as it’s the first one to combine three concepts of leadership, organizational culture and performance with the research conducted in non-profit organizations and that counts in the involvement of participants from different countries. The main limitation of the current study is the concordance between number of variables and sample size. The sample of 240 respondents is quite usual for a psychological research, however, the present study contained 69 variables included in the analysis. For this large amount of variables the sample should have included circa 700 participants. This limitation was partly solved by computing the variables. Another limitation of the study is the language level. Participants received the questionnaire in English, while none of them was a native English speaker. The implication for a future research here would be using Portuguese and Ukrainian versions of the questionnaires or selecting a sample from English-speaking countries, like the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The next limitation of this study was the form how the questionnaire was presented to participants. The questionnaire was e-mailed to the respondents, and they had to send it back when it’s complete. The direct interaction and support to participants from a researcher could improve the reliability results. The future research can also include other measures of leadership, organizational culture and performance, having two different measure for each construct would be helpful as well as it would provide a more transparent understanding of the measured phenomena. The study was able to provide cultural diversity of the results, as the research was conducted on Portuguese and Ukrainian sample. The future research can include other countries in the analysis to see a broader perspective of organizational culture, performance and leadership in non-profit organizations. Keywords: leadership, organizational culture, organizational performance, non-profit organizations, Portuguese organizational culture, Ukrainian organizational culture, Clan, Adhocracy, Hierarchy and Market culture. Este trabalho tem como objetivo estudar a relação entre a liderança, a cultura organizacional e o desempenho no contexto da gestão de uma organização sem fins lucrativos. O contexto de organizações sem fins lucrativos é especificamente merecedor de atenção porque essas organizações têm de adoptar uma atitude diferente perante as partes interessadas e estratégias organizacionais diferentes, em comparação com as organizações empresariais. Isso faz com que a questão da orientação autêntica e de uma cultura organizacional forte seja ainda mais importante para as organizações sem fins lucrativos. A pesquisa foi realizada na organização internacional sem fins lucrativos chamada AIESEC, em contexto internacional, envolvendo participantes de Portugal e da Ucrânia. A AIESEC é uma organização internacional sem fins lucrativos dirigida por estudantes e recém-formados com o foco principal no intercâmbio internacional, na situação mundial, na liderança e na gestão. Portugal e Ucrânia foram escolhidos como principais países envolvidos neste estudo, pois a autora trabalhou na AIESEC em ambos os países, estando familiarizada com a realidade organização nesses países. As hipóteses definidas estabeleciam que o desempenho organizacional nas organizações sem fins lucrativos é influenciado pela liderança e pela cultura organizacional, e que a cultura apresenta um efeito mediador dessa relação. Além disso, este estudo procurou descrever a natureza da liderança e das culturas organizacionais, reais e ideais na AIESEC, na Ucrânia e em Portugal. O questionário foi enviado aos participantes via e- mail. Foram recebidas 252 respostas, no entanto, 12 foram consideradas inelegíveis devido a várias razões: os participantes não entenderam as diretrizes para o preenchimento do questionário ou o seu domínio da língua inglesa não era suficiente. O questionário de Liderança Autêntica (ALQ) de Avolio e Walumbwa (2007) foi utilizado para avaliar as percepções face à liderança. Os participantes foram convidados a pensar sobre o seu chefe de equipa e indicar a frequência com que cada afirmação relativa ao estilo de liderança se lhes apresenta verdadeira, respondendo a um questionário de 16 itens. Relativamente à cultura organizacional, foi utilizado o questionário desenvolvido por Cameron e Quinn (2000), o OCAI, que inclui quatro tipos de cultura organizacional (Clânica, Hierárquica, de Mercado e Adocracia). O OCAI de Cameron e Quinn foi usado para avaliar o modo como os inquiridos percebem a cultura organizacional real, em comparação com a ideal. Os participantes avaliaram as seis dimensões fundamentais da cultura organizacional, obtendo-se as suas perceções acerca do modo como a organização opera e quais os valores que a caracterizam. Para avaliar a sua organização, responderam a seis perguntas, distribuindo 100 ponto pelas quatro alternativas propostas para avaliar a cultura organizacional real e ideal. Quanto ao desempenho organizacional, a escala de 5 fator, recuperado de Ogbonna e Harris (2000) foi utilizado para avaliar o modo como os inquiridos avaliam o desempenho organizacional em termos de satisfação do cliente, crescimento das vendas, quota de mercado, vantagem competitiva e volume de vendas. Os participantes atribuíam um valor cada um dos fatores mencionados acima numa escala de 0 a 100. As escalas utilizadas nesta investigação apresentaram consistência interna, dado que os valores do alfa de Cronbach eram elevados, tanto para o modelo global como para cada uma das variáveis identificadas. Estes resultados permitem dizer que o estudo satisfaz os critérios de validade. Participaram neste estudo 240 estudantes, membros da AIESEC, divididos em dois grupos, de acordo com o país de origem, 120 membros da AIESEC na Ucrânia e 120 da AIESEC em Portugal. Eram estudantes de diferentes universidades da Ucrânia e Portugal e de diferentes cidades da Ucrânia e Portugal, com idades entre 19 e 26 anos de idade. Os dados foram analisados utilizando o programa SPSS 21. 0 e o programa AMOS 22, 0. O SPSS foi utilizado para análise da estatística descritiva, validade e confiabilidade, análise fatorial exploratória e análise de correlação, enquanto o programa AMOS foi usado para realizar a path-analysis,na construção do um modelo. A hipótese baseada no estudo de Obgonnad e Harris (2000) foi confirmada, o que significa que, em organizações sem fins lucrativos, a liderança e influencia a cultura organizacional e o desempenho, sendo a cultura organizacional mediadora da relação entre a liderança e o dessempenho. As hipóteses que indicam as diferenças entre o estilo de liderança e cultura organizacional na AIESEC na Ucrânia foram confirmadas, indicando os resultados que a liderança transparente se encontra mais nas organizações sem fins lucrativos portuguesas do que nas ucranianas. Esta investigação mostrou que as organizações sem fins lucrativos na Ucrânia, ou seja, a AIESEC, tendem a apresentar uma cultura real mais direcionada para o Mercado e a Hierarquia, enquanto nas organizações sem fins lucrativos em Portugal a cultura real percebida é clãnica e adocrática. As perceções face à cultura ideal, dos inquiridos portugueses e ucranianos apresentou resultados semelhantes, o que significa que em Portugal a cultura ideal é o clã, enquanto na Ucrânia a cultura ideal é a hierarquia. Esta tese é única, pois é a primeira a estudar os três conceitos em simultâneo - a liderança, a cultura organizacional e o desempenho – no contexto das organizações sem fins lucrativos, e com o envolvimento de participantes de diferentes países. A principal limitação deste estudo consiste na adequação do número de variáveis ao tamanho da amostra. A amostra de 240 respondentes é bastante usual para uma pesquisa psicológica, no entanto, o presente estudo continha 69 variáveis incluídas na análise. Para esta grande quantidade de variáveis a amostra deveria ter incluído cerca de 700 participantes. Esta limitação foi parcialmente resolvida pela agregação em dimensões. Outra limitação do estudo situa-se ao nível de língua. Os participantes receberam o questionário em Inglês, enquanto nenhum deles tinha o Inglês como língua materna. A implicação para a investigação futura aqui seria usar dos questionários com duas versões em português e ucraniano ou a selecionar uma amostra de países de língua Inglês, como o Reino Unido, EUA, Canadá, Austrália e Nova Zelândia. Uma terceira limitação refere-se ao modo como o questionário foi apresentado aos participantes. O questionário foi enviado por e-mail aos respondentes que deviam reenviá-lo de volta após o seu preenchimento. A interação direta e apoio aos participantes por parte do investigador poderia melhorar a confiabilidade dos resultados. Em investigações futuras poder-se-á incluir outras medidas de liderança, cultura organizacional e desempenho, com duas medidas diferentes para cada constructo, no sentido de compreensão mais transparente dos fenômenos medidos. Este estudo conseguiu por em evidência a diversidade cultural dos resultados, sendo realizado com amostras portuguesa e ucraniana. A investigação futura poderá incluir outros países na análise no sentido de proporcionar uma perspetiva mais ampla da cultura organizacional, do desempenho e da liderança nas organizações sem fins lucrativos...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the structural characteristics of the Japanese Black Calf raising in the Handa Central Area of Kyushu. A large scale agricultural development project is now progressed in the area that covers 4 districts such as Shonai,Yufuin,Kokonoe and Kusu in Oita Prefecture. In this study, special attention has been focused on, (1) production cost and feed utilization, (2) profitability and productivity and (3) comparative aspects with the Japanese Brown Calf raising of the Aso district in Kumamoto Pref. The data used in this study were farm records of the Kusu and the Aso districts for the period 1976 - 80 from the Survey on Production Cost of Japanese Calves conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFFJ). The results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Almost 94 percent of beef cattle producers in 1980 followed the cow-calf system of cattle raising. But most of cow-calf operations were small scale and tota 1 number of cows has decreased since recently. 2. Cow-calf <b>operaters</b> tended to use a shorter raising period than operators in other regions up to 1 month or shorter. Calf price per kilogram was higher than Japanese Brown Calf but lower than national average level. 3. About 48 percent of the production cost per cow has been accounted for by family labor cost and it was higher than any other region. This was caused by large labor use for feed processing. 4. On feed utilization, cow-calf operators preferred to purchase crops, rice bran and wheat bran rather than commercial mixed feed. This feeding system was contrastive to other regions which largely depended on commercial mixed. The preference for crops,rice bran and wheat bran in this area seemed to be caused by their low prices. But it increased the labor hours after all, since these items were manually mixed or processed by family labor with inefficient implements. 5. In 1980, average income per cow was 148, 338 yen which was higher than the Aso district (90, 310 yen) and the national average level (147, 477 yen). But, labor earning per day was only 2, 276 yen which was higher than the Aso district (1, 512 yen) and lower than the national level (3, 936 yen). Labor earning per day in this area became small in response to large labor hours, whereas income was in the highest level. 6. Cow-calf raising in this area was found to be characterized by labor intensive and capital saving methods, whereas that in the Aso district was characterized by capital intensive and labor saving methods. In labor productivity, this area was inferior to the Aso district. In order to increase the profitability and the labor productivity, cow-calf operators should make effortsto save labor hours by the scale enlargement. Also for this, enlargement of pasture and the investment of capital in farm machineries and associated implements are necessary. 本稿では，広域農業開発事業が進められている九州高原地帯の阿蘇久住飯田地域の飯旧中央地区(大分県庄内，湯布院，九重，玖珠の 4 町) における黒毛和種子牛生産の構造的特徴を明らかにするために， (1) 子牛の生産費及び飼料構造， (2) 子牛生産の収益性及び生産性に重点をおいて分析してきた. 分析過程において同地区の黒毛和種と阿蘇地域(熊本県) の褐毛和種との比較も行なった. 資料ば 1976 - 80 年の農林水産省「和子牛生産費個表」玖珠町と阿蘇町分である. 分析結果以下のことが指摘される. (1) 1980 年現在飯田中央地区肉用牛生産農家の 94 ％が子牛生産経営であり，同地区繁殖牛頭数は大分県の約 3 分の 1 を占める. しかし戸当たり繁殖牛頭数は 2. 3 頭で零細であり，近年同地区の繁殖牛頭数は一部先進地域を除けば激しい減少傾向にある. (2) 玖珠町の子牛出荷は他地域に比べて早い傾向がある. 同町のほ育・育成期間は 249 日であり，阿蘇町より 2 か月， 大分県及び全国平均より 1 か月も短い. 一方，玖珠町は子牛単価において阿蘇町の褐毛和種と全国平均水準とのほぼ中聞に位置する. (3) 玖珠町における子午生産費構造の大きな特徴は家族労働費が非常に大きいことであるが(費用合計の 48 %) ， これは飼料構造とりわけ飼料の調理・給与・給水作業時間が多いことに起因する. (4) 玖珠町の飼料構造の特徴は，配合錦料の購入が少なく，その代わりに穀類及びぬか・ふすま類の購入が多いこと，エンシレージ及び野生草の利用が多いことである. 十分な機械設備を備えていない条件の下で，割安な穀類及びぬか・ふすま類を購入し自家混配 1, 512 円よりは高いものの全国 3, 936 円よりはるかに低い. 子午の価格差は品種間及び地域聞の収益格差のたきな要因である. (6) 玖珠町は子牛生産において労働集約的かっ資本節約的であり，阿蘇町は資本集約的かっ労働節約的であるといえる. 1980 年現在玖珠町の子牛生産の労働生産性は時間当たり 440 円であり阿蘇町 544 円より低い. 玖珠町の場合今後収益性向上のためには，規模拡大のもとに機械設備投資及び粗飼料基盤拡充による省力化で，資本装備率と土地構成を高め，労働生産性の高度化を図らなければならない. 一方，阿蘇町は固定資本の効率的運用による資本生産性の向上が粗飼料基盤の拡充とともに要請される...|$|R
40|$|On October 4, 2007, I {{presented}} a paper titled “Healing Waters, Healing Histories: Aboriginal Pilgrimage in Western Canada” at the American Communication Association Conference in Taos, NM. This paper builds {{on a previous}} conference paper, currently under review with a journal, which was an initial exploration of ideas {{about the role of}} Native Catholic pilgrimage among indigenous people in the wider context of tourism and leisure behaviour and its impacts on individual and social welfare. The current paper focused more closely on the resonance between discourses concerning spiritual ideas of ‘healing’ and ‘reconciliation’ in the pilgrimage tradition and those involved in the current political fashion for Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, such as that just launched by the Conservative government. For the conference, my main intent was to discuss the case study and theoretical context with colleagues who are much less familiar with the Canadian context but are aware of Native American conditions, politics and tourism economies. Since several other papers also dealt with ideas about discourse including issues of political and cultural texts {{in the creation of the}} sense of place (sacred, national, cultural, historical etc), I was interested in learning of other work and approaches related to the topic. The conference was relatively small with about three dozen participants, and papers were presented in colloquium style within small discussion groups. This was very helpful since each session was allotted 90 minutes, with plenty of time for discussion and questions. My session was attended by between 8 and 10 people (some wandering between sessions), one of whom was a man from Peru who had insights based on long-established indigenous/Catholic pilgrimage in that region. There were many unexpected questions dealing with residential school history, the Canadian west, and other areas where my own assumptions of established knowledge proved to need supplementing with explanation for this and future publication audiences. One person responded that she had been unaware that there actually were ongoing political, social and cultural issues concerning Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal relationships in Canada; while surprising at first, this underlines a widespread misconception about the success of Canadian mythologies of multiculturalism and consensus which is also useful to my own discussion. Following the conference I was further able to pursue some related field research in local pueblo and tourism settings, in an area where indigenous tourism and cultural enterprise is far more developed than it is in western Canada, but which shares many related sets of ideas and mythologies. One of these sites was an important pilgrimage venue, where again I located several areas of overlap with my own case study. As well as the above focus of activity, I attended several sessions related to areas of interest to the Communication Studies program, including one on social marketing, which is a topic of growing interest to a significant sector of our students as well as our centre. The presenter and I spent some time discussing a course she is developing on the topic, and I hope to pursue this connection in future. Another session was a roundtable on a collaborative electronic publishing project, which may also have interesting applications to Athabasca University as it develops a publishing program and related collaborations. Travel is a medium of communicating information and experience across time and space; aboriginal tourism involves consumption of sacred sites, traditions and contemporary cultures by outsiders. While much research addresses these phenomena, much less is known about the contemporary mobilities of aboriginal people as travellers themselves. The annual Lac Ste Anne pilgrimage in western Canada draws up to 40, 000 indigenous people each year from across western North America and beyond. The site was long a traditional ceremonial and healing place, later becoming a Catholic mission and shrine, and is currently shared with village residents, recreationists and a First Nations reserve. Pilgrims include those seeking individual healing in the context of a collective search for social reconciliation over the legacies of the residential school system. New Aboriginal event management, meanwhile, seeks to balance entrepreneurship and facility development with traditional meanings, as do others amid the rising numbers of casino <b>operaters</b> on provincial reserves. Finally, the federal government has designated the pilgrimage site a national historic site, adding layers of new stories and nationalist symbolism. The paper argues that the pilgrimage mediates vertical and horizontal dimensions of experience in its typical emphasis on healing or reconciling relationships between human, spiritual and natural worlds. It represents a ground for performance of evolving identities and relationships extending from pre-contact to the present time. Analysis moves from anthropological perspectives on ritual and cultural hybridity to communication models concerning the role of media forms in sustaining and evolving cultures. It incorporates critical theory in understanding ‘places-apart’ in relationship to the power structures of contemporary society. The goal is to assess the pilgrimage event as a hub of mobilities on several levels for aboriginal participants. Academic & Professional Development Fund (A&PDF...|$|R
