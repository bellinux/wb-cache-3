5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge {{stream of water}} swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they {{believed to be a}} flood.|$|E

5|$|When {{operating}} a full circle route, trains start through the Common Tunnel. If running clockwise, {{they pass through}} all the common stations (Tøyen, Grønland, Jernbanetorget, Stortinget, Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen). They head north on the Sognsvann Line, stopping at Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion. The Ring Line proper then splits <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trains serve Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen, before Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line. After that, the trains again enter the Common Tunnel at Tøyen.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an {{aircraft}} carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but {{had no way to}} recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty {{an aircraft carrier}} design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> CBA expired at midnight.|$|E

5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|By April, {{resistance}} against the Third Army was tapering <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On April 14, 1945 Patton {{was promoted to}} general, a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton's battle accomplishments during 1944. Later that month, Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine {{as well as the}} Ohrdruf concentration camp, and seeing the conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn the Red Army would take Berlin, feeling the Soviet Union was a threat to the U.S. army's advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague before V-E Day on May 8 {{and the end of the}} war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E

5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and the High Road. It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> church consecrated in 1904. The square tower was added after the First World War by Canon Egan as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> plane became engulfed in flames. Miller escaped physical injury, but was shaken by the accident. Again Miller escaped disciplinary action, and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Australians focused their main effort on Bougainville towards the capture of Buin in the south. The effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Nevertheless, the 31st/51st Battalion continued to undertake patrols along the Ratsua front, during which they suffered further casualties, until they were withdrawn from combat operations on 28 June. They were subsequently moved back to Torokina.|$|E
