Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the very effective sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign.

5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
