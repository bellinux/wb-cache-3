5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility <b>of</b> <b>stopping,</b> slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort. In Laos the agency began Operation Pincushion in 1962 for that reason. The operation evolved into Operation Hardnose, in which CIA-backed Laotian irregular reconnaissance team operations took place.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamp intensity, area, and aspect ratio on reaction time. Recent trends in auto body styling have begun to incorporate center high-mounted stop lamps (CHMSLs) into spoilers and trunk lids. These developments, brought on in part by technical advances in automotive lighting, have resulted in questions about the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps whose effective luminous area is long and narrow. Subjects in this study were asked to perform a computer-based tracking task to control their eye fixations, and to provide the approximate cognitive loading associated with driving, while responding to the onset <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps <b>of</b> varying characteristics. The results of this laboratory study indicate that aspect ratio and intensity <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps, as well as their interaction, influence reaction time. Specifically, subject reaction times to the onset <b>of</b> simulated <b>stop</b> lamps were longer when the stimulus intensity was low and the aspect ratio was large. These results suggest that further empirical investigation that examines intensity, area, and aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps in the context of the total rear-signaling system is required to determine whether regulation affecting the aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps or CHMSLs is warranted...|$|R

5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} {{hours of the}} {{legislative}} session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the clocks in their respective chambers {{a few minutes before}} midnight {{in order to avoid the}} constitutionally mandated deadline for the end of the session – midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and direction for the state's road-building plan for the next six years. The bill was delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he vetoed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, the bill was passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming the bill was actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin with. On July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale American support began {{during the}} Kennedy Administration {{in the early}} 1960s, {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of the US Special Forces to help out in the field. The arrival of {{helicopters}} changed the nature of the battle considerably. Helicopters enabled South Vietnamese soldiers to quickly fly to almost any point in the country, leaving little time for a retreat. Throughout 1962, the combined forces were increasingly effective in routing the Viet Cong. These tactics, combined with the use of armored personnel carriers, took a heavy toll on various fledgling Viet Cong units. The lightly armed Viet Cong had no weaponry capable <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the armored carriers and inevitably were forced to flee, taking heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Several groups {{specifically}} {{concerned with}} nuclear issues {{were established in}} the mid-1970s, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected Labor Government failed to implement its stated policy <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> uranium mining. But by the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case; CANE was disbanded in 1988.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a conceptual framework}} for the generation of activity and travel patterns {{in the context of}} more general structures and presents an integrated model system as a step toward development of an improved travel demand forecasting model system. We propose a two-stage structure to model activity and travel behavior. The first stage, the stop generation and stop/auto allocation models, consists of the choices for the number <b>of</b> household maintenance <b>stops</b> and the allocation <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> and autos to household members. The second stage, the tour formation model, includes the choices for the number of tours and the assignment <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> to tours for each individual, conditional on the choices in the first stage. Empirical results demonstrate that individual and household socio-demographics are important factors affecting the first stage choices, the generation <b>of</b> maintenance <b>stops</b> and the allocation <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> and autos among household members, and the second stage choices, the number of tours and the assignment <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> to tours.

5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E

5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1989, the Giants entered the 1990 season as a Super Bowl favorite, though most {{believed}} they stood little chance <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the 49ers. The Giants began {{the season with a}} 27–20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, then won their next nine games before losing a rematch to Philadelphia 31–13 in Week 12. The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and to the Bills at home in the regular season before defeating both teams in playoff rematches. In the Week 15 game against Buffalo, starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot. He was replaced by Hostetler, who did not lose a game. The Giants' defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (211), and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers in the regular season. After the season, six Giants were selected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E

Heading to the Cosmic Egg, the party are stopped by Hatanaka, who reveals {{himself to be}} the willing Mirage Master of Gharnef: the two are planning to perform the Opera of Shadows, summoning Medeus to consume the real world's Performa. The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find {{the pieces of the}} Fire Emblem and perform the Opera of Light to summon the power of the Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> Medeus. Collecting the Fire Emblem pieces, they learn the story of the Hero-King Marth, a warrior from ancient times who bested and sealed away Gharnef and Medeus. The group encounter and defeat Hatanaka and Gharnef, but their sacrifice coupled with the offering of Marth's soul completes the Opera of Shadows and summons Medeus. Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories restored and Medeus gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians {{and asked them}} to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage.|$|E
