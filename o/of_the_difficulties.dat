5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University examined some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{in making this}} kind of analysis, and found Kennedy {{likely to be the}} 8th-to-15th-most liberal Senator during the 108th Congress.|$|E
5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small {{foothold}} in southern Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, but many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in wolf relocation programs.|$|E

5|$|For pharmacology, Shen wrote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of {{adequate}} diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as}} the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
5|$|In light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{in raising}} capital for these {{expansions}} and despite MIT's privately endowed status, Walker {{and other members}} of the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $200,000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ($ in 2016 dollars). After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.|$|E

5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species are}} {{difficult}} or impossible to distinguish from each other using observable characteristics; laboratory incompatibility tests are often used on pure cultures to reliably determine species. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> posed by routine species identification, the use of DNA sequencing and phylogenetic approaches has become a standard method to help clarify relationships between species. Species differ in their geographical distribution and ecological position, host specificity, microscopic and macroscopic features, and also in their aggressiveness in colonizing wood hosts. The following list of Armillaria species {{is based on the}} taxonomic overviews provided by Volk and Burdsall in 1995, David Pegler in 2000, and reports of new species that have been published since then.|$|E
5|$|The Lombards under King Wacho had {{migrated}} {{towards the}} east into Pannonia, taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> facing the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy {{following the death}} of its founder, Theodoric in 526. Wacho's death in about 540 brought his son Walthari to the throne, but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by Alboin's father, Audoin, of the Gausian clan. Seven years later Walthari died, giving Audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning Lethings.|$|E

5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges.

Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking {{an end to the}} personal union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was also aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{to promote}} a {{commemorative}} coin for the exposition began around January 1892. They were strongly advocated {{by the head of}} the Company's Committee on Liberal Arts, James Ellsworth, who was particularly interested as he had recently purchased a 16th-century painting by Lorenzo Lotto of a learned man, said to be Columbus. Ellsworth wanted the portrait to be the basis of the coin. In this, he was advised by author and journalist William Eleroy Curtis, also a fair official. In April 1892, partisans had gained the support of the Director of the Bureau of the Mint, Edward O. Leech, who envisioned a coin carrying a visage of Columbus on one side, and a suitable inscription on the other. Curtis was well aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> with the Mint's failed competition for new silver coins in 1891, which had led to the issuance of the Barber coinage, designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The new coins were widely criticized, and Curtis counseled Ellsworth to gain control of the commemorative coin's design process, to ensure both a better design {{and the use of the}} Lotto portrait. No United States coin had depicted an actual person, although the goddess of Liberty had often been portrayed.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the Command {{was given}} the {{investment}} it needed. Radar and long-range aircraft enabled the Command to hunt and destroy U-boats with growing efficiency. German submarines had been sinking {{a large number of}} Allied ships in the Atlantic Gap, which was a stretch of water in the central Atlantic beyond the range of most Allied aircraft. The covering of the gap by very-long-range aircraft equipped with radar helped reduce the effectiveness of U-boats. In May 1943 the campaign reached a peak, when a large number of U-boats were sunk with little loss to Allied shipping; Coastal Command had gained the initiative and it was known by the Germans as Black May. Thereafter the suppression of German submarines was effective in the Atlantic and in their transit routes through the Bay of Biscay in 1942, 1943 and 1944. In June 1944 the Normandy landings and subsequent Operation OVERLORD liberated France and cost the Germans their air and submarine bases won in 1940. The U-boats were forced to relocate to Norway and Germany in August, restoring many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> faced by the Kriegsmarine in 1939 and early 1940. The entire strategic position, which had been the foundation of the U-boat war since June 1940 had been undermined.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his {{squadron}} {{which had}} been equipped with {{a version of the}} Bristol Blenheim. John was not enthusiastic about flying the Blenheim. The turret had been eliminated to reduce weight and increase speed, but the flying suits and cockpit were not heated, which caused discomfort to the crews over the winter period. The radios were too short-range which caused communication problems. The Blenheim's cockpit windshield was multi-faceted and difficult to clean. It was also liable to reflect light; which made cooperation with searchlights hazardous. The unit also had unspecified problems with blind-flying instruments. The squadron incurred some losses owing to the inexperience of crews flying patrols over the North Sea from RAF North Weald in Essex, a number of them a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> with the aircraft. In January 1940 604 moved to RAF Northolt and flew Blenheim's adorned in the Finnish Air Force Swastika to Finland via Sweden to assist the country after the Soviet invasion.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Hollandia in May 1944. The swampy area with its restricted anchorages proved unsuitable {{for a major}} airbase complex, although fighter strips were constructed, and it was developed as a staging area. MacArthur was compelled to press on with the Wakde-Sarmi project lest his troops become stranded without adequate air cover. A shortage of shipping meant that the operation had {{to be carried out}} by the troops in the Hollandia area, so Krueger nominated the 163rd Regimental Combat Team for Wakde, {{while the rest of the}} 41st Infantry Division captured Sarmi. However, with only days to go, doubts surfaced about the viability of construction in the Sarmi area, and Biak was substituted. In view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> involved in changing plans, and moving the troops around, MacArthur agreed to postpone both operations, Wakde until 17 May and Biak to 27 May.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1680, Charles married Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark (1656–1693), {{daughter}} of King Frederick III of Denmark (1609–1670). He {{had previously been}} engaged to his cousin, Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege, but the engagement was broken after a scandal. Charles and Ulrika were engaged in 1675 {{in an attempt to}} smooth over longstanding hostilities, but the Scanian War soon broke out. During the war, Ulrika Eleonora gained a reputation for loyalty to her future home country by exhibiting kindness to Swedish prisoners: she pawned her jewelry, even her engagement ring, to care for the Swedish prisoners of war. Her personal merits and continued charitable acts throughout her tenure endeared her to the Swedish people and eased some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> brought on by her Danish background. In the peace negotiations between Sweden and Denmark in 1679, the marriage between her and Charles XI was on the agenda, and ratified on 26 September 1679. They married in Stockholm on May 6, 1680 in a hasty and humble ceremony.|$|E
