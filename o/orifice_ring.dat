40|$|The {{gas turbine}} engine, as an {{adaptable}} source of power, {{has been used}} extensively for electric power generation, mechanical drive and jet propulsion. Driven by competition within the industry, gas turbine engine manufactures strive to produce ever more efficient products that also comply with emission regulations. The overall efficiency, as a crucial parameter governing engine performance and life cycle operating costs, depends on a high turbine inlet temperature, {{as well as an}} appropriately high pressure ratio across the compressor. The turbine components operating at elevated temperatures could experience serious problems, such as unwanted creep, oxidation or thermal fatigue, which compromise the integrity and reduce lifespan. In modern gas turbine engines, cooling air bled from the compressor is used to prevent overheating of the turbine, through the secondary air system. As much as 25 % of the compressor air bypasses combustion to be used for cooling and sealing purposes. Hot gas ingress {{is one of the most}} important and intricate problems of the secondary air system faced by engine designers. Ingress occurs when the hot gas from the mainstream is ingested into the wheel space, formed by the turbine disc and its adjacent casing. A rim seal is fitted at the periphery of the wheel-space, and a sealing flow of coolant is used to purge the cavity reducing or preventing ingress. Sufficient sealing flow is required, but an excessive use of coolant decreases overall engine efficiency. Therefore, from engine designers’ perspective the use of sealing air must be minimised. Optimisation of the rim-seal design is a crucial approach to fulfil the purpose. The double-clearance rim seal is widely employed in gas turbines, which consists of an outer-seal at the periphery of the wheel-space and an inner-seal located radially inboard. The annular cavity formed between the double-seal arrangement is known to predominantly confine the ingested hot gases, thus significantly reducing ingestion inboard of the inner seal. In order to study how double-clearance seals operate in depth, this thesis describes a new single stage turbine research facility, designed for conducting extensive and comprehensive experimental studies on ingress for different rim-seal configurations. Experimental study conducted with the new facility is reported for a variety of generic but engine-representative double-clearance seal configurations, to gain insights into the sealing effectiveness and fluid dynamics associated with different rim-seal design features. Besides being adaptable for various rim-seal configurations, the research facility was also designed to be highly versatile in respect of wheel-space geometries and gas path blading, in order to investigate the impact on ingress from the aerodynamics both inboard and outboard of the rim seal. Extensive instrumentation was incorporated into the turbine stage for the measurements of pressure, swirl velocities, gas concentration and temperature. Additionally, the facility is capable of modelling leakage flow paths found in actual gas turbines to explore novel techniques that could reduce ingress by utilising the leakage air. A parametric study is presented for a range of double-clearance rim seal configurations, characterised by various design features both on the stator side and rotor side of the turbine disc system. Gas concentration measurements were made for each configuration to assess the relative sealing performance. The sealing effectiveness was determined both in the outer wheel-space between the double clearances, and in the inner wheel-space radially inboard of the inner-seal. These measurements constitute a research database that will support the design approach at Siemens, in conjunction with the theoretical model previously developed at Bath, which treats the seal clearance as an <b>orifice</b> <b>ring</b> and uses adapted Bernoulli’s equation to correlate sealing flow rate and pressure difference across the seal. The sealing effectiveness is correlated with pressure and swirl ratio in the wheel-space to study the fluid dynamics associated with different rim-seal features, in support of rim-seal design and optimisations for secondary air systems...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the laterals of an underdrain system manufactured by Johnson Screens, a test-stand basin was built at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Two laterals were placed in the basin of which one was a blind lateral, i. e. with no orifice holes, for the leakage test. The laterals were 8 -inch conduits with 9. 25 -inch diameter vee-wire wrap around them. Eleven series of tests were conducted on the laterals, of which five test series were to assess the hydraulic performance under the backwash mode, three test series to assess the hydraulic performance under the filter mode, and three test series to determine the amount of leakage. Under the backwash mode, the flow rate from every two <b>rings</b> of <b>orifices</b> was measured using a flow-capturing apparatus. The flow rate varied from 53 GPM at the upstream point to 64 GPM at the downstream point. Two tests series were also conducted and flow velocities around the lateral were measured to determine the turbulence intensity along the lateral. The average turbulence intensities estimated at the upstream, downstream and the midpoint of the lateral were comparable. Under the filter mode, the flow rate from the <b>orifice</b> <b>rings</b> could not be measured, therefore, only the approach flow velocities were measured. The average turbulence intensities estimated at the upstream, downstream and the midpoint of the lateral were again comparable. For the leakage test, the amount of leakage exceeded the threshold during the first two series. Subsequently, the tested lateral was modified and improved by the Johnson Screens crew members. The final product was tested and the amount of leakage under 35 psi pressure with a duration of four minutes decreased to 5 GPM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} the textures of MgAl 9 Zn 1, MgAl 6 Zn 1, MgAl 3 Zn 1 and MgAl 2 Mn alloys have been studied, using {{individual}} grain orientation measurement (“ACOM”) in the SEM. Hot extruded billets, unidirectional, reverse and cross-rolled sheet metals {{as well as}} laser welding seams have been investigated. In the shaft of a partial extrudate through a circular die <b>orifice,</b> a <b>ring</b> fiber texture has formed which continuously changes into a spiral fiber texture in the bottom neck. The unidirectional and the reverse hot rolled MgAl 2 Mn specimens show an R type texture with a small asymmetrical split whereby the basal poles are tilted by about ± 12 ° from the sheet normal direction to the rolling direction. In the hot cross rolled specimens, the basal poles are slightly spread both {{in the first and}} second rolling directions. Texture in the laser welding seams is weak and distinctly {{different from that of the}} sheet material. There is almost no heat affected zone at the margins of the welding seams...|$|R
50|$|Scheme 1 {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the first step, the creation of a 13 membered <b>ring</b> <b>orifice</b> on the fullerene surface. A 1,2,4-triazine 2 is fitted with two phenyl groups and a pyridine group for reasons of solubility and reacted in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with pristine C60 fullerene 2 in a Diels-Alder reaction at high temperature and for an extended reaction time. In this reaction nitrogen is expulsed and an 8-membered ring is formed (3). This orifice is further extended by reaction with singlet oxygen in carbon tetrachloride which causes one of the ring alkene groups to oxidize to a ketone. The 12-ring is extended to a 13-ring by reaction with elemental sulfur in presence of tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene.|$|R
40|$|The Combustion Stability Tool Development (CSTD) project, {{funded by}} the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, began in March 2015 {{supporting}} {{a renewed interest in}} the development of a liquid oxygen/hydrocarbon, oxygen-rich combustion engine. The project encompasses the design, assembly, and hot-fire testing of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center 40 -klbf Integrated Test Rig (MITR). The test rig models a staged-combustion configuration by combining an oxygen-rich preburner (ORPB), to generate hot gas, with a thrust chamber assembly (TCA) using gas-centered swirl coaxial injector elements. There are five separately designed interchangeable injectors in the TCA that each contain 19 - or 27 - injector elements. A companion paper in this JANNAF conference describes the design characteristics, rationale, and fabrication issues for all the injectors. The data acquired from a heavily instrumented rig encompasses several injectors, several operating points, and stability bomb tests. Another companion paper in this JANNAF conference describes this test program in detail. In this paper, dynamic data from the hot-fire testing is characterized and used to identify the responses in the ORPB and TCA. A brief review of damping metrics are discussed and applied as a measure of stability margin for damped acoustic modes. Chug and longitudinal combustion stability models and predictions are described which includes new dynamic models for compressible flow through an orifice and a modification to incorporate a third feed line for inclusion of the fuel-film coolant. Flow-acoustics finite element modeling is used to investigate the anticipated TCA acoustics, the effects of injector element length on stability margin, and the potential use of an ORPB <b>orifice</b> trip <b>ring</b> for improving longitudinal stability margin...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThere is {{a debate}} about how the {{indirect}} hernia sac should be treated {{in order to prevent}} hernia recurrence. Recently, nonligation treatment of the indirect hernia sac has been proposed and performed successfully in patients with nondilation of the internal ring. AimsTo evaluate the feasibility of nonligation of the indirect hernia sac among patients with a dilated internal ring. Materials and methodsData were gathered from January 2005 to August 2008. Patients from two regional hospitals included 117 senior male patients with indirect inguinal hernia and medium or large internal <b>ring</b> <b>orifices.</b> The patients were divided into two groups: a ligation group and a nonligation group. Simultaneous posterior wall reinforcement with Shouldice repair was performed on both groups. ResultsIn the ligation group, high-ligation of the indirect hernia sac was performed in 60 patients with 62 hernia repairs. In the nonligation group, nonligation treatment of the hernia sac was performed in 57 patients with 60 hernia repairs. The postoperative pain intensity (p =  0. 730) and complication rate (p =  0. 560) were similar between the two groups. After a 3 -year follow up period, six patients (10 %) in the ligation group and eight patients (14 %) in the nonligation group were lost to follow-up. The recurrence rate of indirect hernia was similar in both groups (p =  0. 893). ConclusionIn senior male patients with a dilated internal ring, nonligation treatment of the indirect hernia sac is a safe procedure with no adverse influence on indirect hernia recurrence if a simultaneous posterior wall repair is performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{fullerene}} family {{consists of}} four basic groups: a) exohedral fullerenes, b) endohedral fullerenes, c) open-cage fullerenes and d) heterofullerenes. In the present thesis, three of the above categories have been studied. The principal findings are as follows: In the First Chapter, the mechanism of the Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition of photochemically generated photoenols to C 60 was investigated. For this purpose, deuterium labelled o-alkyl benzaldehydes were synthesized and primary and asecondary kinetic isotope effects were measured. These results indicate that neither the H or D abstraction step nor the [4 + 2] cycloaddition step determine {{the rate of the}} reaction. On the contrary, bond rotation over a substantial barrier around Caromatic– Ccarbonyl bond in the triplet excited state of the starting material, is probably the rate determining step. The remarkable inverse isotope effects found in most of the cases {{can be attributed to the}} smaller effective size of the C–D bonds relative to the C–H bonds which induces weaker non-bonded interactions (remote steric isotope effect). In the Second Chapter the synthesis of several cage-opened fullerenes is described. Firstly, novel derivatives bearing sulphur heteroatoms along the rim of their aperture have been isolated and subsequently, some chemical transformations of the organic addends, under acidic conditions, led to the attachment of various groups on the fullerene core. In the second part, we report the synthesis of ten new open-cage C 60 derivatives having a 16 -membered <b>ring</b> <b>orifice.</b> These compounds were formed after a regioselective addition reaction of an aromatic hydrazine or hydrazone to a diketone C 60 derivative possessing α,β-unsaturated carbonyl structure. Adducts were isolated in moderate to high yields. In the Third Chapter the chemical reactivity of aza[60]fullerene dimer (C 59 N) 2 is studied. At first, thermal reaction of (C 59 N) 2 with furan afforded the electrophilic aromatic substitution product at the 2 -position of the furan ring from the azafullerenium cation C 59 N+. Next, the photo induced electron transfer (PET) reaction between C 59 N+ and electron rich aromatics as well as simple aliphatic alkenes was studied. Concerning benzylsilanes with high oxidation potentials (> 1. 68 V) or benzylsilanes and benzylstannanes with low oxidation potentials (< 1. 50 V), the PET reaction didn’t proceed successfully. However, benzylsilanes with oxidation potentials in the rage of 1. 5 - 1. 7 V, appear suitable for the performance of this reaction. Finally, simple π-systems such as tri- and tetra-methyl ethylene as well as cyclohexene, underwent the ΡΕΤ reaction with C 59 N+ affording new azafullerene adducts. Here, we must note that these are the first examples of photochemical reactivity of such electron poor double bonds with fullerenes. ...|$|R
