5|$|In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist organization, assumed {{control of}} much of the {{southern}} part of the country and promptly imposed Shari'a law. The new Transitional Federal Government (TFG), established two years earlier, sought to re-establish its authority. With the assistance of Ethiopian troops, AMISOM peacekeepers and air support by the United States, it managed to drive out the rival ICU and solidify its rule. On 8 January 2007, as the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> Kamboni raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the Somali Army, entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The government then relocated to Villa Somalia in Mogadishu from its interim location in Baidoa, marking the first time since the fall of the Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.|$|E
5|$|The British {{flotilla}} arrived off {{the independent}} town <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> al-Khaimah on 11 November, discovering Minerva and {{a fleet of}} dhows in the harbour. The pirate fleet initially sailed out to attack the British but retreated once {{the size of the}} expeditionary force became clear. Minerva failed to make the return to port successfully and was wrecked on a sandbank, the crew setting fire to their ship to prevent her seizure by boats launched from Chiffone. Onshore, the Al Qasimi and their Bedouin allies (whose numbers are unknown, but were significantly less than 20,000) formed a series of emplaced defences around the town that were protected from offshore bombardment by sandbanks which blocked the approach of Wainwright's heavier warships. On 12 November, Wainwright deployed his smaller ships close inshore to bombard the town and provide cover for his troop dispositions offshore.|$|E
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing {{one person in the}} crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} vaccinations in adults {{and the risk of}} developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Data from the Swedish population-based Epidemiological Investigation <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> case-control study encompassing 1998 incident cases <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> aged 18 – 70 years and 2252 randomly selected controls matched for age, sex and residency were analysed. Those vaccinated within 5 years before disease onset were compared with those not vaccinated by calculating OR with 95 % CI. Results Vaccinations neither increased the risk <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> overall (OR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 9 to 1. 1) nor the risk of two major subgroups <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> (antibodies to citrullinated peptide-positive (ACPA-positive) and ACPA-negative disease). Furthermore, vaccinations did not increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> in smokers or carriers of HLA-DRB 1 shared epitope alleles, two groups with established risk factors for RA. Conclusions In this case-control study of incident cases <b>of</b> newly diagnosed <b>RA,</b> no increased risk <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> following immunisation was observed for vaccinations overall or for any specifi c vaccination. This indicates that immunological provocation of adults with commonly used vaccines in their present form carries no risk <b>of</b> <b>RA.</b> These fi ndings should be implemented among public healthcare providers in order to encourage vaccinations according to recommended national vaccination schedules...|$|R

In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages to keep people away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported to the oil fields of the nation. The liquefied natural gas terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing. Around 20,000people were affected, and damage in the country was estimated at around $4.2billion (2007USD).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{an inflammatory}} disease, {{which results in}} destruction of the joint. The presence of immune complexes (IC) in serum and synovial fluid <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> patients might contribute to this articular damage through different mechanisms, such as complement activation. Therefore, identification of the antigens from these IC is important to gain more insight into the pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>RA.</b> Since RA patients have antibodies against citrullinated proteins (ACPA) in their serum and synovial fluid (SF) and since elevated levels of citrullinated proteins are detected in the joints <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> patients, citrullinated antigens are possibly present in IC from RA patients. Methods: IC from serum of healthy persons, serum <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> patients and IC from synovial fluid <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> patients and Spondyloarthropathy (SpA) patients were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Identification of the antigens was performed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and immunodetection. The presence of citrullinated proteins was evaluated by anti-modified citrulline (AMC) staining. Results: Circulating IC in the serum <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> patients and healthy controls contain fibrinogen beta and fibronectin, both in a non-citrullinated form. Additionally, in IC isolated from RA SF, fibrinogen. and vimentin were identified as well. More importantly, vimentin and a minor portion of fibrinogen beta {{were found to be}} citrullinated in the isolated complexes. Moreover these citrullinated antigens were only found in ACPA+ patients. No citrullinated antigens were found in IC from SF of SpA patients. Conclusions: Citrullinated fibrinogen beta and citrullinated vimentin were found in IC from SF <b>of</b> ACPA+ <b>RA</b> patients, while no citrullinated antigens were found in IC from SF of ACPA-RA patients or SpA patients or in IC from serum <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> patients or healthy volunteers.
