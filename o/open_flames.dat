25|$|The {{fetus is}} even more {{susceptible}} to damage from carbon monoxide intake, which can be harmful when inhaled during pregnancy, usually through first or second-hand tobacco smoke. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the infant born to a non-smoking mother is around 2%, and this concentration drastically increases {{to a range of}} 6%–9% if the mother smokes tobacco. Other possible sources of prenatal carbon monoxide intoxication are exhaust gas from combustion motors, use of dichloromethane (paint thinner, varnish removers) in enclosed areas, defective gas hot water heaters, indoor barbeques, <b>open</b> <b>flames</b> in poorly-ventilated areas, atmospheric exposure in highly polluted areas.|$|E
500|$|Allegations {{regarding}} {{the treatment of}} Afghan detainees resurfaced in November 2009 via parliamentary testimony by Richard Colvin, the second highest-ranked member of Canada’s diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007. Colvin claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. This would be consistent with special reports by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the US Department of State. Colvin also said the torture involved beatings, whipping with power cables, the use of electricity, knives, <b>open</b> <b>flames</b> and rape. The Canadian government dismissed opposition calls for a public inquiry the next day. [...] "There has not been a single, solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces", Defence Minister Peter MacKay said in the House of Commons, with his parliamentary secretary suggesting Colvin was not credible.|$|E

500|$|The Whopper Bar is {{a concept}} from the company that upends its {{traditional}} fast food operations with a newer high end concept designed to compete with fast casual and casual dining restaurants.

The locations feature an open kitchen with a semi-circular metal counter top designed to allow customers to watch as its [...] "Whopperistas" [...] put together the order. The exposed kitchen concept allows customers to view the preparation of their foods. Decoration of the new locations is limited to plasma televisions playing looped videos of <b>open</b> <b>flames.</b> The concept {{is similar to the}} McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into malls, airports and casinos and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with work}} on open bench tops, work {{performed}} within a BSC must be performed carefully and safely. To avoid contamination {{and the risk}} of personnel exposure, the CDC advises investigators to follow best practices to reduce and control splatter and aerosol generation, such as keeping clean materials at least [...] from aerosol-generating activities and arranging the work flow [...] "from clean to contaminated". In particular, <b>open</b> <b>flames,</b> not necessary within the clean environment of a Class II or III BSC, cause disruption of the airflow inside. Once work inside a BSC has been completed, it is necessary to decontaminate the surfaces of the BSC as with other lab equipment and materials.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Battle of Hayes Pond", {{also known}} as [...] "the Klan Rout", made {{national}} news.

Approximately 500 Lumbee, armed with guns and sticks, gathered in a nearby swamp, and when they realized they possessed an overwhelming numerical advantage, attacked the Klansmen. The Lumbee encircled the Klansmen, opening fire and wounding four Klansmen in the first volley, none seriously. The remaining Klansmen panicked and fled. [...] Cole was found in the swamps, arrested and tried for inciting a riot. The Lumbee celebrated the victory by burning Klan regalia and dancing around the <b>open</b> <b>flames.</b>|$|E

30|$|For <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> ignition, {{the number}} of {{residential}} mattress/bedding-related fires decreased significantly between 1980 and 2006. This decrease in <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> ignition fires {{is associated with the}} introduction of CPSC’s child-resistant lighter regulation (16 CFR Part 1210 ([1994])) in 1994 (Smith et al. [2002]) and wider dissemination of safe behaviors regarding match and lighter storage and display around children (out of sight and out of reach) (Smith et al. [June 1991]). However, the average number of civilian deaths and injuries showed a downward trend with large year-to-year fluctuations. From Figure 1 b it appears that, 1992 onwards, the <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> ignition fires caused higher number of civilian injuries compared to those caused due to smoldering ignition fires suggesting that the, <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> ignition represents a more immediate hazard than smoldering ignition. By 2006, however, the combination of 16 CFR 1632, low smoldering cigarettes, and other factors had significantly reduced all such losses – by 93 % in {{the number of}} fires and 73 % and 68 % in the number of civilian injuries and deaths respectively.|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{ignition}} of non-fire-resistant hydraulic fluid sprays was conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Both an <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> and a hot steel surface were used as the external heat sources. With the <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> as the heat source, the minimum oil temperature and minimum spray nozzle pressure that resulted in an ignition were measured. The effects of {{the distance between the}} <b>open</b> <b>flame</b> and the nozzle and the nozzle orifice diameter on the ignitability of the hydraulic fluid sprays were examined.

The ignition of oil sprays from the impingement of oil jets onto a vertical surface was also investigated. Finally, the results are compared with those obtained for fire-resistant hydraulic fluids.
