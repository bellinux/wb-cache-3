40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} state <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> in New Zealand following the 2008 change {{in government and}} consequent shift in educational priorities. This case study examines the provision <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> in a full, co-educational primary school in a provincial area. Data gathered {{from a variety of}} stakeholders indicate that, in its recent history, the school’s provision varied considerably – from applying a structured, whole-school approach to lacking official policies and practices, to re-establishing school-wide provision. Provision was dependent on management priorities that often echoed national priorities that took the focus off <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> and talented learners. These findings suggest that if national priorities do not explicitly include gifted and talented learners along with learners with special educational needs, then these students may be left vulnerable as schools shift their focus elsewhere.

40|$|In Australia, the {{implementation}} of policies and provisions for <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> vary among the states and territories. A commonality across the country is the reports of negative attitudes towards giftedness and <b>gifted</b> <b>education,</b> as outlined in The Australian Senate Committee’s report, The Education of Gifted Children (Collins, 2001). This study was an inquiry into the attitudes of teachers in South-East Queensland state primary schools. In particular, it explored attitudes towards intellectually gifted children and their education, and factors that {{may be associated with}} these attitudes. Research was undertaken in eight schools with varied levels <b>of</b> involvement in <b>gifted</b> <b>education.</b> The study consisted of two research phases. In the first phase of research, teachers’ (N = 126) attitudes were surveyed using Gagné and Nadeau’s opinionnaire, Opinions about the <b>gifted</b> and their <b>education</b> (Gagné, 1991). This opinionnaire used a 5 -point Likert scale to measure teachers’ attitudes towards six issues in gifted education: perceived needs <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> students and support for special <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> provisions; common objections to <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> based on teachers’ ideologies and priorities; the social value <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> people in society; the rejection and isolation faced by gifted people; ability grouping; and acceleration. Additionally, a teacher profile form yielded information about teachers’ demographic characteristics and backgrounds. This quantitative data was used to test associations between attitudes and demographic variables. In the second phase of research, case studies of two teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and practices were conducted. This qualitative research included semi-structured interviews and review of school documents. From the survey research, themes emerged of positive attitudes towards <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> and <b>gifted</b> people in society. However, {{there was a lack of}} support for the provision of ability grouping and acceleration, and minimal awareness of the isolating experiences faced by gifted children. Employment at schools with a focus on <b>gifted</b> <b>education,</b> and experiences <b>of</b> in-service training in <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education,</b> were most significantly associated with positive attitudes. Case study results illustrated the differences in pedagogical beliefs that may exist between teachers with different attitudes towards intellectually gifted children and their education. Findings from this study suggest that further teacher training and involvement in <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> may assist in improving attitudes towards intellectually gifted children and their education. These results may also have implications for evaluation <b>of</b> Queensland <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> reforms and the nature of in-service training provided in schools. Findings from the case study research also suggest there may be a relationship between attitudes and pedagogical practice that warrants further investigation...|$|R

The first factor, teacher training, involves the right <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> children to be educated by specially qualified teachers.

The second factor, gifted identification, requires that giftedness and characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>gifted</b> be clearly defined. Delivery models are another contributing factor. As {{an alternative to the}} regular classroom, program prototypes for the gifted are listed, including acceleration programs, enrichment programs, and guidance programs. The use of community resources is also a factor, and a mentor program can be used to fill the gap of needs unmet in the classroom. The final factor is the importance <b>of</b> evaluating the <b>gifted</b> program.
