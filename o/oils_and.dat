In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner.

The transformation of the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas sector with the separation of independent enterprises and organizations providing services in the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas service sector is compared by the author with the trend of rapid development of the service sector in the postindustrial economy. The purpose of the study is to identify the general and specific characteristics of modern <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas services and to determine the directions for the transformation of organizational forms of entrepreneurship in the sphere under consideration. The growth of quantitative parameters of the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas services market has been analyzed. The classification of this market is proposed depending on the place of services in a single technological cycle in relation to the main oil production process. The positive consequences of the development of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas services for the development of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas production have been systematized. Basic organizational models of entrepreneurship development in <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas service are generalized and substantiated. It is shown that the main influence in the market of services is taken by vertically integrated national <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas companies, as well as by international companies that provide service support for the work of Russian <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas companies. The results of a comparative analysis of advantages and disadvantages of organizational models of entrepreneurship in the field of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas services are presented. It is proved that <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas service as an organizational form of entrepreneurship in its development reflects the general trends of the post-industrial economy.
