5|$|The three films Wilder {{appeared}} in following The Producers were box office failures: Start the Revolution and Quackser seemed to audiences poor copies of Mel Brooks films, while Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory {{was not a}} commercial success, although it later gained a cult following and an <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> Best Score, {{as well as a}} Golden Globe award nomination for Wilder.|$|E

5|$|Ran won several {{awards in}} Japan, {{but was not}} quite as honored there {{as many of the}} director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the {{selection}} of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 57th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> Best Directing that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Rans costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.|$|E

25|$|Oakie is {{probably}} most notable for {{his portrayal of}} Benzino Napaloni, the boisterous dictator of Bacteria, in Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940), for which he received an <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> Best Supporting Actor. This role was a broad parody of the fascist then-dictator of Italy, Benito Mussolini.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Morricone {{received}} his second <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> The Mission.

25|$|Weir's first {{romantic comedy}} Green Card (1990) was another casting risk.

25|$|Fearless (1993) {{returned}} to darker themes and starred Jeff Bridges {{as a man}} who believes he has become invincible after surviving a catastrophic air crash. Though well reviewed, particularly the performances of Bridges and Rosie Perez—who received an <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> Best Supporting Actress—the film was less commercially successful than Weir's two preceding films.

A {{backstage}} comedy set {{among the world}} of small-time travelling performers, it featured Giulietta Masina and Lattuada’s wife, Carla del Poggio. Its release to poor reviews and limited distribution proved disastrous for all concerned. The production company went bankrupt, leaving both Fellini and Lattuada with debts to pay for over a decade.
