50|$|Switchgear {{is often}} {{inspected}} using thermal imaging {{to assess the}} state of the system and predict failures before they occur. Other methods include partial discharge (PD) testing, using either fixed or portable testers, and acoustic emission testing using surface-mounted transducers (for oil equipment) or ultrasonic detectors used in <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchyards.</b> Temperature sensors fitted to cables to the switchgear can permanently monitor temperature build-up. SF6 equipment is invariably fitted with alarms and interlocks to warn of loss of pressure, and to prevent operation if the pressure falls too low.|$|R

5000|$|Busbars are {{produced}} {{in a variety}} of shapes such as flat strips, solid bars and rods typically copper, brass or aluminium in solid or hollow tubes. Some of these shapes allow heat to dissipate more efficiently due to their high surface area to cross-sectional area ratio. The skin effect makes 50-60 Hz AC busbars more than about 8 mm thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher current applications. A hollow section also has higher stiffness than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in <b>outdoor</b> electrical <b>switchyards.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 11 December 2006, the Electricity Commission (NZ) {{received}} an application from Transpower {{for the establishment}} of a new 220 kV gas insulated switchgear (GIS) facility adjacent to but geographically separate from the existing <b>outdoor</b> 220 kV <b>switchyard</b> at Otahuhu. This project was described as the Otahuhu substation diversity project, and included transferring approximately half of the circuits from the existing switchyard to the new GIS switchyard, to improve network resilience. The project was approved in August 2007.|$|R
5000|$|From the Harbour Bridge {{the route}} follows the Northern Busway. The cables are {{installed}} in ducts that were originally placed during {{the construction of}} the busway in 2005. [...] Cable joint bays are installed at 500-800 m intervals. The cables are deviated from the Northern Busway at Wairau Road to connect to a new grid exit point (Wairau Road) adjacent to Vector's Wairau Valley zone substation, containing a single 120 MVA 220/33 kV connecting into the Wairau Valley zone substation and supplying the southern North Shore. Vector’s work at this site includes the conversion of the existing <b>outdoor</b> 33 kV <b>switchyard</b> into an indoor switchroom. From Wairau Road, the cable route again follows the Northern Busway to Constellation Drive.|$|R
50|$|The final {{total cost}} of the project was £24,102, 800 of which £19,151,700 was for civil engineering, £445,000 on the {{bulkhead}} caissons and stage 2 civil works, £4,506,100 on the purchase and installation and commissioning of the eight generators and <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchyard.</b> Included in the civil engineering cost was £900,000 for the early completion bonus and £35,900 on expediting the programme.|$|E
5000|$|The Power House on {{the right}} bank of the Gerusoppa dam {{consists}} of four Francis-type turbines coupled to the generating units of 60 MW each.

50|$|At {{the base}} of the {{spillway}} are sluice gates designed to pass 80,000 cusecs (2265 m3/s). During construction these sluice gates were used to divert the river via a diversion channel. The upstream section of the diversion channel was unlined and followed an old natural channel of the river before reaching the spillway and sluice gate block which is curved at the exit to direct water away from the <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchyard.</b> The surfaces were finished to a high standard to ensure a smooth flow of the water during medium and high flows.|$|E

Very careful quality control has been required due to wide variation of raw material quality for construction. Author has constructed the quality control and quality assurance management system and organized the QAQC team. Continuous education and training for team staffs have been carried out to ensure the technical level of testing. All manufacturing records have been input and checked daily. Even these efforts for quality control were carried out, but some quality failures have been observed. These failures are also introduced as case studies in this report...|$|E
