40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{changes in}} retinal nerve fiber layer thickness {{as measured by}} scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) after the use <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucomatous or ocular hypertensive patients. Methods: The authors prospectively enrolled 37 eyes of 37 patients in whom IOP was reduced by more than 25 % after the use <b>of</b> <b>medication.</b> The images were obtained before and 15 to 30 days after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>medication.</b> The SLP parameters measured {{before and after the}} use <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> were compared using paired Student's t Test. Results: The mean IOP was significantly reduced from 26. 57 ± 4. 23 mmHg to 16. 54 ± 2. 92 mmHg after the use <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> (p 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: Continuity of care is {{considered}} foundational to high-quality care. Traditional {{continuity of care}} constructs may adequately characterize care quality in general populations, but may merit reconceptualization for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, interactions between multiple chronic condition patients and providers involve complex medication management; therefore care continuity measurement may be more relevant if focused on the provider subset who prescribes essential medications for chronic conditions—a construct we call continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management. Our objective was to explore conceptual distinctions between continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management and continuity of care, survey existing evidence in this area, and discuss implications of our findings for future research and intervention development. Methods: In this topical review, we discuss conceptual distinctions between continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management and continuity of care, review the limited continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management–related empirical evidence, and discuss implications for future research and interventions. Results: Continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management represents a potential conceptual and measurement advance by reflecting interpersonal continuity and management continuity, and may provide a means of identifying patients at high-risk of adverse events. Empirical evidence also establishes support for continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management as a meaningful measure of care continuity. Finally, continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management {{may also be a}} potential target for future intervention to improve care delivery among multiple chronic condition patients. Conclusion: If continuity <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> management is validated in diverse populations, correlated with patient outcomes, and responsive to change, then it may be an important target for improving the health and health care of multiple chronic condition patients...|$|R

Research has shown important racial differences in pain thresholds and perceptions, but {{little is known about}} racial variations in responses to pain <b>medications.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this study was to compare perceptions of efficacy <b>of</b> pain <b>medications</b> among African-American and Caucasian veterans with OA. METHODS: Participants (N = 202; 70 % Caucasian, 30 % African-American) were under care for OA within the VA healthcare system. Participants rated the helpfulness <b>of</b> current analgesic/anti-inflammatory <b>medications</b> (scale <b>of</b> 1 [...] not at all helpful to 10 [...] very helpful). RESULTS: The mean rating <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> helpfulness was 6. 1. African-American participants reported significantly greater ratings <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> helpfulness than Caucasians (6. 6 vs. 5. 9), controlling for demographics, disease severity, total number <b>of</b> analgesic/anti-inflammatory <b>medications</b> being taken, and the class <b>of</b> the <b>medication.</b> CONCLUSION: African Americans had somewhat more favorable perceptions <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> helpfulness than Caucasians. However, overall ratings <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> helpfulness were relatively low.

40|$|The Organizational Safety Space Model (OSSM) was {{developed}} {{as a tool to}} investigate the factors which influence the safety of industrial operations. It is applied in this study to investigate the safety <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> administration in adult critical care settings, including Intensive Care Units and High Dependency Units. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 adult critical care nurses. The participants’ views on the safety <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> administration were analyzed using OSSM. The data suggested that the safety <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> administration is subject to complex influences of many organizational factors. Socio-cultural factors, including lack of questioning culture, the perceived hierarchy of professions and the nature of nursing education, were identified as influential safety factors. Furthermore, organizational complexity and structures created tension between organizational, ethical and structural priorities on one side, and the requirements of safe management <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> in critical care a setting on the other, inevitably leading to tradeoffs among these organizational priorities. Some organizational factors are difficult to classify according to the OSSM and the model is not fully operational in identifying factors related to the safety <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> administration. While the OSSM’ theoretical framework helped to focus on the underpinning safety factors in the organization <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> administration, it remains unproven as an operational tool to understand the full complexities and interplays between the organization structures, professional differences and socio-cultural impacts on the safety <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> administration in adult critical care setting.

50|$|A {{transdermal patch}} is a {{medicated}} adhesive patch that {{is placed on}} the skin to deliver a specific dose <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> through the skin and into the bloodstream. Often, this promotes healing to an injured area of the body. An advantage of a transdermal drug delivery route over other types <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> delivery such as oral, topical, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. is that the patch provides a controlled release <b>of</b> the <b>medication</b> into the patient, usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> or through body heat melting thin layers <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> embedded in the adhesive. The main disadvantage to transdermal delivery systems {{stems from the fact that}} the skin is a very effective barrier; as a result, only medications whose molecules are small enough to penetrate the skin can be delivered by this method. A wide variety of pharmaceuticals are now available in transdermal patch form.|$|R

5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration <b>of</b> <b>medications</b> to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The first likely {{description}} of the disease was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The condition was described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation.

5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>medications</b> {{available}} including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to {{work as well as}} immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E

5|$|About {{two weeks}} after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500people in 18shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400people in shelters elsewhere. Many others were either {{residing}} with relatives or staying at their damaged properties. The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000litres (20,000gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies. The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>medications</b> or emergency medical equipment. About 60FEMA personnel worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their stay on the island, the group assisted 163people, mostly for minor issues. Overall, there were about 100FEMA workers involved on the island, although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects <b>of</b> <b>medications.</b> Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use <b>of</b> <b>medications.</b> Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
40|$|Medication {{reconciliation}} is the “process <b>of</b> comparingthe <b>medications</b> {{that the}} patient has been taking prior {{to the time of}} admission or entry to a new setting with the medications that the organization is about to provide. ” 1 The primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> reconciliation is to reduce the frequency <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> errors that could result in harm to patients. 2 Medication reconciliation has been shown to improve the accuracy <b>of</b> recorded <b>medication</b> and allergy information, medica-tion adherence, and medication knowledge; it has also been associated with reductions in the incidence of preventable adverse drug events, frequency of physician visits, and frequency of hospital readmissions. 3 Admission drug histories obtained by pharmacists, one component <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> reconciliation, have been associated with reductions in in-hospital mortality. 4 The Safer Healthcare Now! campaign has identified medication reconciliation as a targeted intervention for improving patient safety in acute and long-term health care institutions. 5 Implementation of a process for medication reconcil-iation has been challenging for some institutions. There is no single model <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> reconciliation that is the “gold standard ” and, because of distinct models of care delivery, each institution generally develops its own method <b>of</b> performing <b>medication</b> reconciliation. 2 One of the questions that arises during implementation <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> reconciliation models is, Which health care professional (or professionals) should have responsibility for medication reconciliation? Many advocate that pharmacists should be responsible for medication reconciliation 6 - 8 since, after all, medication safety is (or should be) our domain, and pharmacists have the most appropriate training to carry out this function. However, medication reconciliation can be time-consuming, and many hospitals have limited pharmacy resources; as a result, some believe that successful systems <b>of</b> <b>medication</b> reconciliation develop and incorporate cooperation and collaboration among multiple health care professionals. 2 Elsewhere in this issue of CJHP (see pag...|$|R
