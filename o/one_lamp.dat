25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in <b>one</b> <b>lamp</b> leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Russian {{engineer}} Pavel Yablochkov {{invented a}} lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high voltage AC line. Instead of changing voltage, the primary windings transferred {{power to the}} secondary windings which were connected to one or several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design, used to keep the failure of <b>one</b> <b>lamp</b> from disabling the entire circuit. In 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|The Enigma was an {{electro-mechanical}} {{rotor machine}} {{used for the}} encryption and decryption of secret messages. It was developed in Germany in the 1920s. The repeated changes of the electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard implemented a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which turned plaintext into ciphertext and back again. The Enigma's scrambler contained rotors with 26 electrical contacts on each side, whose wiring diverted the current to a different position on the two sides. On depressing a key on the keyboard, an electric current flowed through an entry drum at the right-hand end of the scrambler, then through the set of rotors to a reflecting drum (or reflector) which turned it back through the rotors and entry drum, and out to cause <b>one</b> <b>lamp</b> on the lampboard to be illuminated.|$|E

The total cost came to £10,480-12s-8d, which was significantly {{more than the average}} cost of between [...] £4,000 and £6,000 at the time. The light apparatus was specifically designed for the remoteness of the location. Instead of the usual central burner system with <b>one</b> <b>lamp,</b> sixteen lamps were used arranged in four, each with their own mirror behind it. The lamps were mounted on a frame with a square base that completed a revolution powered by a massive clockwork every two minutes, thus achieving a beam every 30 seconds. The reason behind the arrangement was redundancy; even if one of the lamps failed, the other three pointing in the same direction would still produce a, albeit somewhat weaker, beam. The light mechanism was also reasonably simple to repair should the need arise. It was the first revolving light apparatus in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Intercepted Morse coded {{messages}} {{had been}} enciphered by the Germans’ Enigma, an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine that implemented a polyalphabetic cipher. The main model {{in use in}} 1940 had three rotors that set an electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard. Pressing a key caused <b>one</b> <b>lamp</b> to light and the right-most rotor to advance by one letter position. This changed the electrical pathway so that pressing the same key again caused a different letter to light up. At one of the 26 positions, a notch on the right-most rotor engaged with the middle rotor so that the two rotors advanced together, and similarly the middle rotor would engage with the left-most rotor, giving a very long period before the sequence repeated (26 [...] 26 [...] 26 = 17,576). The ring on the rotor that contained the notch and so caused the next rotor to advance, could be set {{to any one of}} the 26 positions. The three rotors were selected from a set of five, giving 60 different ways of mounting rotors in the machine. However, because the Germans laid down the rule that no rotor should be in the same position on successive days, if the previous days's rotors and their positions were known, this number was reduced to 32.|$|E

50|$|The switch used {{to control}} a 3-way lamp is usually a rotary switch or a pull-chain switch. Although it is {{referred}} to as a 3-way switch, it has four positions, off, <b>lamp</b> <b>one</b> (low), <b>lamp</b> two (medium), and <b>lamps</b> <b>one</b> and two (high). When properly connected to a 3-way socket containing a 3-way bulb, this switch will first power one filament, then the other filament, then both, then return to the off position. To do this, the switch must be capable of operating two different circuits. Internal to the switch there are two sets of switch contacts that are not connected electrically, but which are connected mechanically {{in such a way that}} they operate together as shown in this table.|$|R
