40|$|An optical {{instrument}} {{we refer}} to as the “biaxial orientation device” has been developed for finding the optical plane, acute bisectrix, and <b>obtuse</b> <b>bisectrix</b> in biaxial crystals by means of optically aligning conoscopically formed melatopes and measuring the angular coordinates of the melatopes, where the angular values allow for determination of the optical plane containing the optical axes using a vector algebra approach. After determination of the optical plane, the instrument allows for the sample to be aligned in the acute bisectrix or <b>obtuse</b> <b>bisectrix</b> orientations and to be transferred to a simple mechanical component for subsequent grinding and polishing, while preserving the orientation of the polished faces relative to the optical plane, acute bisectrix, and <b>obtuse</b> <b>bisectrix</b> during the grinding and polishing process. Biaxial crystalline material samples prepared in the manner are suitable for accurate spectroscopic absorption measurements in the acute bisectrix and <b>obtuse</b> <b>bisectrix</b> directions as well as perpendicular to the optical plane...|$|E
