The player can attack other racers {{to take away}} a Shine Sprite from them, and racers with the fewest Shine Sprites are {{eliminated}} from the game <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> single player, if the human player is eliminated from the round, the game ends {{and the results are}} randomized.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the decline}} <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> wives as being portrayed solely as housekeepers, the {{portrayal}} of mothers as the primary physical care takers of children {{has been on the}} decline.

5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> discrete steps.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is, within two films Wall Street and Wall Street. Money Never Sleeps, to explore {{characters}} from different levels of capitalism’s characteristics and ideological positions, what kind of society and ideological patterns the two films reflect and in which ways do the films promote and/or criticize capitalism. Theories on ideology and ideology critique are applied and used in a discourse analysis in order to compare characters of different levels of capitalism’s ideologies and characteristics <b>over</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the films and describe what kind of society and ideological patterns the two films reflect. The outcomes show that characters’ ideologies and characteristics actually change <b>over</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> the films. And the outcomes also show that the two films generally promote capitalism by creating same model of story under different societies and ideological patterns...|$|R

5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Friedman's {{views from}} an interventionist {{to a more}} {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|Christian's group {{remained}} undiscovered on Pitcairn until 1808, {{by which}} time only one mutineer, John Adams, remained alive. Almost all his fellow mutineers (including Christian), and their male Polynesian companions, had killed each other <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> varying conflicts. The only survivors of these conflicts were Adams and Ned Young, who had subsequently died of asthma in 1800. No action was taken against Adams.|$|E

He observed that the rationale for justifying censorship of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E

McGrattan made headlines midway through the 2007–08 campaign when he fought teammate and goaltender Ray Emery – himself a noted fighter – in practice.

5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E
5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks.

5|$|The {{bank has}} gained its funding from {{different}} sources, {{and the main}} contributors have shifted <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank started to get most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales {{as a source of}} finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed 'Grameen Bank Act' which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for any aspect of the running of the bank.|$|E
5|$|The eyewall {{may vary}} <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} eyewall {{replacement}} cycles, particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one {{at the end of}} the cycle, at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{closely related}} white stork, the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, {{generally}} wading slowly {{in shallow water}} stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees—most commonly deciduous but also coniferous—which {{can be seen from}} long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days,with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.|$|E

5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes <b>over</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
