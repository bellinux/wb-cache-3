25|$|The {{fact that}} radon {{is present in}} indoor air has been known at least since 1950s and {{research}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> on human health started on early 1970s. The danger of radon exposure in dwellings received more widespread public awareness after 1984, {{as a result of}} a case of Stanley Watras, an employee at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Mr. Watras set off the radiation alarms (see Geiger counter) on his way into work for two weeks straight while authorities searched for the source of the contamination. They were shocked to find that the source was astonishingly high levels of radon in his basement and it was not related to the nuclear plant. The risks associated with living in his house were estimated to be equivalent to smoking 135 packs of cigarettes every day.|$|E
2500|$|Cardiovascular {{systems are}} {{regulated}} by the autonomic nervous systems, which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. [...] A distinct balance between these two systems is crucial for the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. [...] Chronic stress has been widely studied <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> of the body resulting in an elevated heart rate (HR), reduced HR variability, elevated sympathetic tone, and intensified cardiovascular activity. [...] Consequently, stress promotes an autonomic imbalance {{in favor of the}} sympathetic nervous system. [...] The activation of the sympathetic nervous system contributes to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and increased incidence of arrhythmias. [...] An imbalance in the autonomic nervous system has been documented in mood disorders; It is commonly regarded as a mediator between mood disorders and cardiovascular disorders.|$|E

2500|$|Since its inception, {{the impact}} of the {{stimulus}} has been a subject of disagreement. Studies <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>effects</b> have produced a range of conclusions, from strongly positive to strongly negative and all reactions in between. In 2012, the IGM Forum poll conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found 80% of leading economists agree unemployment was lower at the end of 2010 {{than it would have been}} without the stimulus. Regarding whether the benefits of the stimulus outweighed its costs: 46% [...] "agreed" [...] or [...] "strongly agreed" [...] that the benefits outweighed the costs, 27% were uncertain, and 12% disagreed or strongly disagreed. IGM Forum asked the same question to leading economists in 2014. This new poll found 82% of leading economists strongly agreed or agreed that unemployment was lower in 2010 than it would have been without the stimulus. Revisiting the question about the benefits outweighing the costs, 56% strongly agreed or agreed that it did, 23% were uncertain, and 5% disagreed.|$|E

The parliamentarians and the Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto had also congratulated prime minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Armed Forces thanking for making its [...] "bold decision" [...] in spite of whatever the economical outcomes were. Political scientist and geostrategist Javed Hashmi was clearly heard saying: [...] "Yes! Yes!.... We have done it.", while he was tapping his parliament desk.
