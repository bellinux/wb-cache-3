40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study and}} {{measurements of the}} electrical conductance in a PbSe and PbS spherical Nano-crystal 3 D matrix layer was carried out focusing on its dependences of Nano-crystal size distribution and size gradient along the layer thickness (z-direction). The study suggests a new concept of conductance enhancement by utilizing a size gradient along the layer thickness from mono-layer to the next mono-layer of the Nano-crystals, {{in order to create}} a gradient of the energy levels and thus improve directional conductance in this direction. A Monte Carlo simulation of the charge carriers path along the layer thickness of the Nano-crystals 3 D matrix using the Miller-Abrahams hopping model was performed. We then compared the conductance characteristics of the gradual size 3 D matrix layer to a constant-sized 3 D matrix layer that was used as a reference in the simulation. The numerical calculations provided us with insights into the actual conductance mechanism of the PbSe and PbS Nano-crystals 3 D matrix and explained the discrepancies in actual conductance and the variability in measured mobilities published in the literature. It is found that the mobility and thus conductance are dependent on a critical electrical field generated between two adjacent nano-crystals. Our model explains the conductance dependents on the: Cathode-Anode distance, the distance between the adjacent nano-crystals in the 3 D matrix layer and the size distribution along the current direction. Part of the model (current-voltage dependence) was validated using a current-voltage measurements taken on a constant size normal distribution nano-crystals PbS layer (330 nm thick) compared with the predicted I-V curves. It is shown that under a threshold bias, the current is very low, while after above a threshold bias the conductance is significantly increased due to increase of hopping probability. <b>Once</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> probability the current tend to level-off reaching the maximal conductance available through the sequential hopping and nano crystals based layer behaves as a resistor under bias...|$|E

5000|$|Earthquakes {{occur as}} a {{consequence}} of gradual stress increases in a region, and <b>once</b> it <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> stress that <b>the</b> rocks can withstand a rupture generates and the resulting earthquake motion is related to a drop in the shear stress of the system. Earthquakes generate seismic waves when the rupture in the system occurs, the seismic waves consist of different types of waves that are capable of moving through the Earth like ripples over water. The causes that lead to slow earthquakes have only been theoretically investigated, by the formation of longitudinal shear cracks that were analysed using mathematical models. The different distributions of initial stress, sliding frictional stress, and specific fracture energy are all taken into account. If the initial stress minus the sliding frictional stress (with respect to the initial crack) is low, and the specific fracture energy or the strength of the crustal material (relative to the amount of stress) is high then slow earthquakes will occur regularly.In other words, slow earthquakes are caused by a variety of stick-slip and creep processes intermediated between asperity-controlled brittle and ductile fracture. [...] Asperities are tiny bumps and protrusions along the faces of fractures. They are best documented from intermediate crustal levels of certain subduction zones (especially those that dip shallowly — SW Japan, Cascadia, Chile), but appear to occur on other types of faults as well, notably strike-slip plate boundaries such as the San Andreas fault and [...] "mega-landslide" [...] normal faults on the flanks of volcanos.|$|R
30|$|It must {{be noted}} that the {{intrinsic}} structure of the directed network and the filtration we use significantly influence how the resulting persistence barcode is read. In the usual undirected persistent homology on finite metric spaces, since the threshold filters only through distances between vertices, higher dimensional simplices are always created as the threshold scans through all distances, and holes of any dimension eventually get filled in. This means that all but one 0 -dimensional bar in the barcode must die. In contrast, our construction of the simplicial complex limits the simplices to maximally connected subnetworks built up from actual directed edges connecting vertices. Hence, 1 -dimensional simplices are introduced only when corresponding directed edges are present, and <b>once</b> <b>the</b> threshold <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> edge weight, no additional simplices can be constructed. This then means that in the barcode, the topological features of the entire directed network are encoded by the bars that never die. We will refer to these bars as perpetual. We note that perpetual bars indeed represent the Betti numbers after computing homology {{at the end of the}} filtration. As we are using a similar filtration (see Sect.  3.4) implemented by jHoles [34] to compute persistent homology for weighted undirected networks, the Betti numbers computed by jHoles and the perpetual bars in our barcode have the same interpretation.|$|R

40|$|Current {{models of}} fault growth examine the {{relationship}} of fault length (L) to vertical displacement (D) where the faults exhibit the classic fault shape of gradually increasing vertical displacement from zero at the fault tips to a maximum displacement (Dmax) at {{the middle of the}} fault. These models cannot adequately explain displacement length observations at the Krafla fissure swarm, in Iceland's northern volcanic zone, where I observe that many of the faults with significant vertical displacements still retain fissure-like features, with no vertical displacement, along portions of their lengths. I have created a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the Krafla region using airborne LiDAR and measured the displacement/length profiles of 775 faults, with lengths ranging from 10 s to 1000 s of metres. I have categorised the faults based on the proportion of the profile that was still fissure-like. Fully-developed faults (no fissure-like regions) were further grouped into those with profiles that had a flattened appearance (large regions of constant vertical displacment), those with a classical fault shape and those that show regions of fault linkage. I measured the Dmax/L ratio of each identifiable original fault within the linked fault profiles, evidencing {{that the majority of the}} original faults had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> D/L prior to linkage. I suggest that a fault can most easily accommodate stress by displacing regions that are still fissure-like, and that a fault would be more likely to accommodate stress by linkage <b>once</b> it has <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> displacement for its fault length. My results demonstrate that there is a pattern of growth from fissure to fault in the Dmax/L ratio of the categorised faults and propose a model for this growth. I suggest it is possible to better understand how faults grow in their earliest stages of development and that the proposed model can be incorporated as an early stage of fault growth for current models which only model behaviour of a fault once it has acquired the classical D/L profile. The range in the distribution of the published Dmax/L data is mainly attributed to tectonic setting, rock type and resolution limiting the choice of sample rate and fault length range. Using the LiDAR data I have examined the effect that data resolution has on the interpretation of the D/L relationship. I have resampled the LiDAR point data to produce two additional DEMs of 10 m and 30 m resolution, from which I have measured 90 and 40 fault profiles respectively. I have compared (Dmax) /L for all of these fault profiles with those of the published data. I have shown that by varying resolution the interpretation of the (Dmax) /L relationship gives trends for each resolution that together account for the spread in results of the combined published data for the length of faults measured. I have proposed that it may be possible to identify whether a measured fault is a single structure or if it is actually a segmented structure, when measured at a higher resolution, based on its location in the Dmax/L published distribution. The currently available surface displacement data in post-rifting Krafla and interrifting Askja are limited either to single point time series of displacement or regional displacement maps that are averaged over time and do not provide details of changes in rate through time. I have created a 24 -epoch InSAR time series from ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 satellite SAR images over the 16 -year period between 1992 - 2008. Using this I have extracted time series at 39 locations, both along- and across-axis at Krafla and Askja, and have identified trends in displacement rates over time. I have produced cumulative displacement profiles, based on the trends in displacement rate, both along- and acrossaxis and identifed key periods of displacement behaviour in the NVZ. I suggest that Krafla has three possible major sources of surface displacement: the shallow magma chamber under the Krafla caldera provides a decaying surface deflation between 1992 and 1999 and two possible deeper sources further north, the first between the Krafla and Fremrinamar fissure swarms creating uplift between 1992 and 1999 and the second beneath the Theistareykir volcanic centre between 2004 and 2008. In Askja I observe that the displacement rate in the caldera, previously thought to be a slowly decaying inflation, incurred a significant increase in rate to 30 mm/yr in 1996 - 2004 followed by a decrease in rate to 10 mm/yr. ...|$|R
