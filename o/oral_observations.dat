The purpose of this study to find out how advertising branding Gudang Garam International of "Survivor" version disguise the dangers of cigarettes on television. Advertising is simply defined as a message that offers a product aimed at the public via a media (Kasali, 1995 : 9). Today, advertising activities is recognize by many, especially industry, as something important. In the science of marketing communications, advertising is an investment to maintain a sustainable relationship between the company and its customers (Widyatama, 2007. 25). In the delivery of those ads contained messages that aim to introduce the brand or product branding by the company. Basically, the brand is a trade name given to a product or service (Klimchuk, 2007. 28). Branding is also responsible for creating memories to the community for these products into the minds of potential consumers. After the brand into the consumer's mind will arise awareness of the existence of a product. At the end of the branding was established patterns of thought on the potential consumers that the products are in accordance with the needs of consumers. In this study, researchers used qualitative research methods to generate descriptive data in the form of words written or <b>oral</b> <b>observations</b> of the researchers of audiovisual works {{in the form of an}} ad to be understood throughly. While analysis of this research uses semiotic analysis which refers to the theories of Charles Sanders Peirce on the understanding of the elements of meaning that is Icon, Index and Symbol. The data collection techniques used in this study is the documentation on the video ads Gudang Garam International of "survivor" version. The results of this study indicate that the branding on this ads intended to disguise the dangers of tobacco products through the jungle as a depiction of an icon, a man's activity as an index that is characterized as an adventurous young professionals, and a powerful symbol of the tiger and aneagle fly. Result of the above, can be recommended to further researchers in conducting studies relating to television advertising branding...|$|E

Having examined the strength of the relationship between overall language exposure estimates and the language proficiency measures in each language, we then turn our attention to the relationship between each of the proficiency measures and, first, the amount of current language input to which the children are exposed, and second, the children's current amount of output in each language. Next we investigate the relationship between the child's stronger language and several variables related to language use, including the language the child finds easier to speak, the language the child prefers reading in and the language used with friends in the school playground...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{revealed}} that the filaments of cytokeratin express different antigenic sites in the basal and suprabasal cell compartment of the skin and oral mucosa. It has been demonstrated that the keratin polypeptide subunit of molecular weight 67, 000 dalton (67 K) is a valuable marker of the suprabasal cells, since the normal basal cells remain unlabeled by antibodies against this large polypeptide. In the present study, {{the distribution of the}} 67 K polypeptide has been investigated on human and guinea pig keratinocyte suspensions, purified basal cells of guinea pigs, normal human abdominal skin and normal human buccal mucosa, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. The results of this investigation confirmed ultrastructurally that the 67 K-antigen expression is lacking in the epidermal basal cell compartment. However, it could be shown that 67 K polypeptide is a component of the tonofilaments in the upper Malpighian cell layers of the skin and <b>oral</b> mucosa. These <b>observations</b> suggest that keratinocyte differentiation is accompanied by modifications of antigenic determinants of the keratin filaments...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{ability is}} a {{fundamental}} part of children’s literacy development, as is observed in the Swedish curriculum with its requirement that teaching should help pupils to develop a multifaceted oral ability. The teacher is responsible for supporting this development in various ways. The aim {{of the study is}} therefore to ascertain how teachers use questions in their interaction with pupils and how the subsequent conversation creates the conditions for developing <b>oral</b> skills. Systematic <b>observation</b> combined with transcriptions of audio recordings was applied to analyse question types and dialogue as used by two teachers in compulsory school. The observations were made in grade 5 and 6 during lessons in civics, geography and Swedish. The results of the study show that closed questions with open, guiding questions occurred most frequently. The ensuing dialogue was usually short, but when support was given it created conditions for the development of oral skills in the pupils.  The results underline the importance of teachers reflecting on which questions to ask in the classroom and how the interaction regarding questions supports the development of pupils’ oral abilities...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{candidiasis}} is {{a significant}} health problem {{in terms of both}} morbidity and economic outlay. Infections are predominantly caused by the commensal C. albicans, and affect immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-positive and AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients and chemotherapy patients. The molecular and cellular immune mechanisms involved in protection from and responses to oral candidiasis are overlapping, but distinct from those associated with other manifestations of the disease, including systemic, vaginal and gastric candidiasis. In <b>oral</b> candidiasis, clinical <b>observations</b> and experimental mouse models suggest a critical role for cell-mediated immunity. In mice, CD 4 + T-cells and the p 40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23 are strict prerequisites for resistance; however abrogation of IFN-gamma does not confer susceptibility. Here, we discuss this apparent inconsistency, and review the experimental evidence that clarifies which immune pathways are specifically involved in resistance and responses to candidiasis of the oral cavity. We also highlight deficiencies in the literature, particularly concerning the putative roles of some relatively new elements in immunobiology: interleukin- 23, interleukin- 17 and T helper (Th) 17 cells...|$|R
