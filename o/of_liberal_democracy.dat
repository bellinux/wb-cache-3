25|$|The {{first three}} years of his {{administration}} were characterised by an economic boom, technological development, political stability and efficient delivery of basic needs to the people.

25|$|Until 2002, the UDF spanned a {{somewhat}} wide ideological spectrum on the centre-right. A tongue-in-cheek characterisation of UDF's membership {{is that it}} was the union of everybody on the right that was neither far-right nor a Chirac supporter. However, the UDF suffered for its lack of cohesion, in contrast to the RPR. The economic policies proposed by UDF's leaders ranged from left-leaning, in favor of social justice, to strongly laissez-faire economics. Such divergences led the laissez-faire advocates <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Democracy,</b> such as Alain Madelin, to split out of UDF on 16 May 1998. This departure followed the elections of UDF politicians for the presidents of 4 regional councils with the votes of FN elects. Indeed, the Liberals refused to condemn these alliances.|$|E

50|$|One notable feature <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> is {{that their}} opponents (those groups who wish to abolish <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy)</b> rarely win elections. Advocates use this as an {{argument}} to support their view that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is inherently stable and can usually only be overthrown by external force, while opponents argue {{that the system is}} inherently stacked against them despite its claims to impartiality. In the past, it was feared that democracy could be easily exploited by leaders with dictatorial aspirations, who could get themselves elected into power. However, the actual number <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> that have elected dictators into power is low. When it has occurred, it is usually after a major crisis has caused many people to doubt the system or in young/poorly functioning democracies. Some possible examples include Adolf Hitler during the Great Depression and Napoleon III, who became first President of the Second French Republic and later Emperor.|$|R
25|$|However, {{while some}} {{former members of}} Criterion were {{attracted}} into the Iron Guard, the Credința writers were still critical of totalitarianism. Before a fascist government was formed by the minor National Christian Party, Credința hosted contributions from Alexandru Mironescu, the physicist and center-nationalist author. These documented the encroachment <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> in Europe, defended political freedoms, and honored Romanian peacemaker Nicolae Titulescu. Although situated to the left, Credința and Floarea de Foc were largely anti-communistic, and Tudor's own news digests took a highly critical view of the Soviet Union. In one such piece, he expressed alarm about {{the outcome of the}} Moscow Trials. However, according to files kept by the Siguranța Statului police force, Tudor still intended to collaborate with communist agent Scarlat Callimachi on the anti-fascist review Munca ("The Labor").|$|E
25|$|Though Hauerwas is most {{well known}} for his work related to ethics and {{political}} theology, he has written widely on a diverse range of subjects, such as philosophical theology, political philosophy, the philosophy of social science, law, education, bioethics, and medical ethics. Hauerwas {{is known for his}} fierce criticism <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy,</b> capitalism, and militarism. He is also a critic of both Christian fundamentalism and liberal Christianity. He is commonly cited {{as a member of the}} evangelical left. Hauerwas's work draws from a number of theological perspectives, including Methodism, Anabaptism, Anglicanism, and Catholicism. Among his most important contributions to modern theology are his advocacy of and work related to virtue ethics and postliberal theology. Hauerwas's book, A Community of Character: Toward a Constructive Christian Social Ethic, was named as one of the one hundred most important books on religion in the 20th century by Christianity Today.|$|E
500|$|Ljotić was staunchly anti-Semitic. He {{is said to}} have {{advocated}} the extermination of Jews for years prior to the outbreak of World War II. He claimed in his speeches that a [...] "Great Director" [...] was behind all of the world's problems and referred to [...] "a collective personality consisting of a people without land, language, a stable religion... a people without roots... the Jews." [...] Ljotić claimed that the supposed Jewish conspiracy began during the French Revolution and was involved in every significant historical event since then. He also claimed that Jews and Freemasons were responsible for the Russian Revolution. In his writings, Ljotić portrayed Jews as being responsible for the advent <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy,</b> Freemasonry and Communism, and, as such, enemies of both Zbor and the Yugoslav state. Ljotić advocated [...] "liquidating the influence of Masons, Jews, and every other spiritual progeny of Jews" [...] as the only way of preventing the outbreak of war in Yugoslavia. He also attributed the political unpopularity of Zbor to the [...] "subversive influence" [...] of Serbian Jews on education and the media. Nevertheless, Ljotić's antisemitism largely lacked racialist ideology due to its incongruity with Christian belief. Despite Ljotić's efforts and those of Zbor, antisemitism in Serbia did not reach the levels seen in other regions of Europe and the Jewish community there was largely spared from harassment and violence until the arrival of German troops in April 1941.|$|E
50|$|Belief in a {{distinction}} between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by libertarians, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights lists {{both positive and negative}} rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions <b>of</b> most <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and unemployment benefits.|$|R
40|$|The European Union is best {{understood}} as a liberal power – as an actor that is composed <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> whose interests, identities and institutions motivate and constrain its policy. The conceptualization of the EU as a liberal power helps to overcome three shortcomings of alternative notions such as civilian power or Normative Power Europe: First, norms are not only understood as driving forces but also as constraints on foreign policy; second, liberal power Europe emphasizes the contested nature of norms and conflicts between norms and thus {{draws attention to the}} politics of EU external relations; third, it encourages an engagement with the vast literature on the distinctive policies <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> in international relations and foreign policy analysis.

40|$|Transparency is {{important}} for liberal democracies; however, the value of transparency is difficult to articulate. In this article we articulate transparency as an instrumental value for providing what we call ensurance and assurance to liberal democratic citizens. Ensurance refers to the property <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> which prevents it from sliding into authoritarianism and assurance is the property whereby citizens are assured that ensurance exists. Looking at the rise of bulk data collection and use afforded by information communication technologies, this paper focuses on the way that technologies disrupt relations {{between the state and}} its citizens, and suggests Value Sensitive Design as a methodology to protect key aspects <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies.</b> Bulk data collection makes the achieving of ensurance and assurance more difficult due to two types of opacity which arise {{as a result of the}} practice: technical opacity—the difficulty for citizens to understand the technology behind bulk data collection; and, algorithmic opacity—opacity which results from properties inherent to algorithms which guide the collection and processing of bulk data. Design requirements will be suggested to respond to the disruptions caused by ICTs between <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> and their citizens which threaten the necessary value for <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> <b>of</b> representativeness. </p...|$|R
