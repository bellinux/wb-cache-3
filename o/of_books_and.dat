5|$|Paris {{is a city}} <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 {{percent of}} French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements.

It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.|$|E
5|$|Rabearivelo {{struggled}} {{throughout his}} life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience.

He has been the subject of a significant number <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the University of Antananarivo. Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo's elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African.|$|E

This prompted a critical analysis of both works in The New York Review of Books in June 2012 by former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E
