40|$|Eugene Meyer was {{a highly}} {{respected}} financier and government official when he was appointed Governor of the Federal Reserve Board in 1930. Through his force of character, he dominated economic policy making during {{the last years of}} Hoover’s administration. He initially found that sizable foreign short-term claims had put the Fed in a precarious position. After reductions in interest rates reduced foreign claims relative to the Fed’s gold reserves, he developed a plan for expansion. His initial plans were constrained by the weak institutional structure of the Fed and the lack of free gold. He obtained legislation creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and section 3 of the 1932 Glass-Steagall Act, temporarily allowing use of government securities as collateral for Federal Reserve notes, overcoming the free gold problem. However, when the 1932 <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> failed to produce an immediate expansion of bank credit, the Federal Reserve Bank governors were able to end additional expansionary policies. Suffering from poor health, political stalemate, and possible sensing Hoover’s ultimate defeat, Meyer’s expansionary efforts effectively came to an end in August 1932. Thus, in spite of strong leadership favoring expansion, the Fed was unable to pursue a sustained expansionary policy. This failure was the direct result of the increased decentralization of power due {{to the creation of the}} <b>Open</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Policy</b> Conference in 1930. Foreign claims on the dollar, particularly French claims, were always a serious concern, at times imposing a dominate constraint on policy. The free gold issue was viewed as a real constraint within the Fed. The 1932 <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> was not a disingenuous ploy to forestall other legislation. It was the direct result of Meyer’s desire to counter the deflationary forces depressing the economy. Central Banking, Economic History...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the Southeast Asian Development Model (SEADM), as practised in parts of Southeast Asia, {{reflected}} an overwhelming emphasis on growth as a goal while neglecting issues of equity and justice.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit {{the debate over}} the role of the banking panics in 1930 - 33 in precipitating the Great Contraction. The issue hinges over whether the panics were {{illiquidity}} shocks and hence in support of Friedman and Schwartz (1963) greatly exacerbated the recession which had begun in 1929, or whether they largely reflected insolvency in response to the recession caused by other forces. Based on a VAR and new data on the sources of bank failures in the 1930 s from Richardson (2007), we find that illiquidity shocks {{played a key role in}} explaining the bank failures during the Friedman and Schwartz banking panic windows. In the recent crisis the Federal Reserve learned the Friedman and Schwartz lesson from the banking panics of the 1930 s of conducting expansionary <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy</b> to meet demands for liquidity. Unlike the 1930 s the deepest problem of the recent crisis was not illiquidity but insolvency and especially the fear of insolvency of counterparties. ...|$|E

This is not surprising because the poor tax administration process in Nigeria (Makinde, 2005; Otusanya, 2010; Adebisi & Gbegi, 2013) has created loopholes for SMEs to evade tax payments. As a result, entrepreneurs worry less about tax payment, {{and as a result}} plough back the income into their business.

These include {{changes in the}} State infrastructure, the economy, the <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policy,</b> democracy {{and the introduction of}} legislation to support these changes. Family and childcare have attracted important attention and concern during these changes from the State authority to meet the future challenges and the needs and satisfaction of children, as well as their parents. No comprehensive research has been conducted in the field of childcare in the State to support, enhance and provide insight into the authority decision-making or policies towards childcare and welfare. Therefore, this study represents the first research in this field and also represents part of the State’s policy to cover this omission. The research aims to open, promote and explore issues of childcare for children with special needs. These issues include care agencies’ practices and values, partnership with parents, services provided, care policies and social barriers. Extensive fieldwork was carried out to provide the data and information needed, with a framework based on systems and family theories to meet the aims and objectives of the research. The main services provided by the care agencies are education and social skills programmes; this reflects the parents’ wishes. The research also provides the various changes needed within the profession to meet the future challenges. On the basis of this research, a number of conclusions have been drawn. Entering into partnerships with parents of children with special needs is still in its early stages in the State. There is a need to promote and encourage this partnership. There is also a need to develop mutual understanding and share experiences with parents. The research has also revealed that the social barriers are the main obstacles for integrating children with special into society...|$|E

40|$|The thesis aims to {{illustrate}} how Food Aid, Free Trade Agreements, and Agricultural Dumping are closely related.

Where macro analyses allows the debate {{to have a more}} theoretical nature, the micro analyses of the case study on Agricultural Dumping in Mozambique shows a more practical side of the debate. By the use of these two analytical tools, the thesis illustrates how Agricultural Dumping is a negative effect of Food Aid, enabled through Free Trade Agreements. As <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> and low domestic protection are part of these agreements, local agricultural markets in sub- Saharan Africa become unable to compete with subsidised imported agricultural goods.

40|$|Mexico’s {{experience}} of liberalization is a canary in the mineshaft for other agricultural {{economies in the}} Global South. Mexico’s political and economic ties to the United States mean that it is subject, {{perhaps more than any}} other country in the world, to the direct political-economic intervention of its powerful northern neighbor. The effects of such interventions have unequivocally hurt the poorest people in the country: those who work on the land in rural areas. Following <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies,</b> we have seen increases in raw measures of economic change in foreign direct investment, aggregate GDP per capita, and export volumes. For example, Mexico’s overall exports increased 7 -fold between 1981, the year before liberalization, and 2001. 1 Imports have matched this rise, with a 6. 7 -fold increase from 1981 to 2001. 2 At an aggregate level, then, it would seem as if Mexico has profited from liberalization.

Inflation targeting, employment, equilibration of the balance of payments, growth targets for monetary aggregates, the stabilization of exchange rates, GDP, or asset prices—these and similar goals for monetary policy are discussed in more or less detail in presentday textbooks. When it comes to the means by which these ends are to be reached, the discussion stops altogether and gives way to a description of the technicalities of <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>policies,</b> discount rates, reserve requirements, and so on. In the present article, we will neglect these technicalities of monetary policy and focus on ultimate means and ends. The rationale for this procedure is twofold. On the one hand, ends such as inflation targeting and growth rates of monetary aggregates are not ultimate, but intermediate ends. The tacit understanding is that they are more or less closely related to the attainment of the ultimate end—the reduction of scarcity (increase of “prosperity ” or “wealth”). Our approach allows us to sidestep the discussion of the validity of this tacit understanding. We will directly addres...|$|R

In particular, the Dollar and Kraay paper is notable for having no theoretical structure supporting the specification of the equations. It is unclear how much significance therefore can be attached to the correlations uncovered. In addition, there are the well-known difficulties of drawing conclusions from large cross section samples as well as the attendant problems of data quality. Finally, the identification of poverty with the income of the lowest quintile does not map into either an absolute or relative measure of poverty. There are thus grounds for an initial scepticism.
