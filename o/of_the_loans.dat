UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated {{to such an extent that}} talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans.</b> Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E

25|$|While Normandie rarely was {{occupied}} at over 60% of her capacity, her finances were such {{that she did}} not require government subsidies every year.

There were two competing designs for this ship, one conservative, one radical. The conservative one was basically Normandie with two funnels, possibly a bit larger as well. The radical one was from Normandies designer, Vladimir Yourkevitch, and was super-streamlined with twin, side-by-side funnels just aft of the bridge. The more conservative design won, but the outbreak of World War II killed the plan.|$|E

Some of the shuttered companies included FTI, payroll and finance services, non-auto (RV, boat and aircraft) loans and the subprime/non-conforming mortgage companies. The independent auditor, Ernst and Young, resigned in 2006. NetBank's mortgage operations suffered greatly. NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions on the open markets. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> that NetBank sold did not meet the underwriting guidelines and NetBank was forced to repurchase these loans from the other banks. Since the loans that did not meet the underwriting guidelines were often past-due loans, NetBank was forced to repurchase a many failed loans that it had written. This loss of capital was very harmful to the company's equity position and was the first clue to the bank's poor financial position.|$|E

Because of this, on 7 August 1965,the then Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.

However, unemployment remained a challenge, therefore Sharif imported thousands of privatised Yellow-cab taxis to many young Pakistanis, but this program came at a cost. Few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loans</b> were repaid {{by the government and}} Sharif found it difficult to privatise these taxis at low rate, since the young and poor could not afford at higher price. However, Sharif indeed privatised these taxis at low rate and his steel industry was forced to pay the remaining cost. During his first and second term, Sharif intensified his policies of industrialisation and privatisation of major industries that were nationalised by former Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Undoing what was previously done in the 1970s remained a challenge for Sharif but, despite the economical slow down, Sharif reverted major policies of Bhutto and under short span of time, 90% of the industries were industrialised and privatised by him. This radical move had a positive impact on country's economy and the economy progressed at an appropriate level. Sharif policies were also continued by Benazir Bhutto, who nationalised only those industries that needed a government bail out plan, and by Pervez Musharraf and Shaukat Aziz in the 2000s who managed to privatised all of the major industries by the end his term in 2008.|$|E
