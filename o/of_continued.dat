5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature.

5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred.

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{agreement}} between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities were obliged to keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was not worth the expense <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25March 1959 following the departure of the last coal wagon.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{the common}} law {{protected}} habitation and sources of wealth and food in a largely agricultural society, the Industrial Revolution, especially the Luddism resulting from workers' perceived threats to their livelihood, required new legislation to match the circumstances. The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise machine-breaking – the destruction of textile-making machinery – as early as 1721. Initially the punishment was transportation to the Colonies {{but as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> opposition to mechanisation the Frame-Breaking Act of 1812 made the death penalty available.|$|E

5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted a policy <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> modernization {{with an eye}} to eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

5|$|Crimewave is a 1986 American comedy film {{directed}} by Sam Raimi, written {{by him and}} the Coen brothers, and starring Louise Lasser, Paul L. Smith, Brion James, Sheree J. Wilson, Edward R. Pressman, Bruce Campbell, and Reed Birney, with Campbell also serving as a producer. Following the commercial success of The Evil Dead (1981), Raimi and Campbell decided to collaborate on another project. Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served {{as one of the}} editors on The Evil Dead, and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot for the film, because <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> interference by the studio.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a video game classic, and is included in multiple top ten lists.

5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E

5|$|Expressions {{of sympathy}} and {{solidarity}} from the European film community manifested in renewed assurances <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> {{support from the}} production's German partners, ARTE, and the French National Film Centre (whose support was conditional on the film having 51% of its dialogue in French). New French financing was secured from production company Mezzanine Film, and in Hungary, the Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation (MMKA) and the Minister of Culture pledged to back the production if a guarantee could {{be made that the}} film would be finished safely. A compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby a quarter of the shoot would take place in Eastern Europe rather than Corsica and fewer shooting days would be allotted. This allowed the original €5 million budget to be reduced by €700,000 to the amount available. With the funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule, the film's producers forged a new co-production contract in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Fool's Gold Loaf is a {{sandwich}} {{made by the}} Colorado Mine Company, a restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with the contents of one jar of creamy peanut butter, one jar of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. The sandwich's connection to Elvis Presley {{is the source of}} its legend and prolonged interest. According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E
5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he felt a twinge in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> pain in his shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E
40|$|Losses {{disguised}} as wins (LDWs) appear to reinforce gambling persistence. However, {{little research has}} examined this phenomenon with real gamblers in natural gambling settings. We aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between within-session outcome size and subsequent gambling persistence. Account-based gambling data of individuals playing LDW games over a randomly selected day (2, 035, 339 bets made by 8636 individuals) was examined. We used a logistic mixed effects model {{to examine the relationship between}} the outcome of the previous bet (loss, LDW and real wins) and the odds <b>of</b> <b>continuing</b> betting in a game session. The odds <b>of</b> <b>continuing</b> betting in a game session were positively associated with the outcome of the previous bet. Compared to LDWs, losses lowered the odds <b>of</b> <b>continuing</b> a game session. In contrast, real wins implied greater odds <b>of</b> <b>continuing</b> a game session compared to LDWs. It is concluded that LDWs increase the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>continuing</b> betting compared to losses, but decrease the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>continuing</b> to gamble compared to real wins. As LDWs increase the number of bets made within a gambling session, and hence within-session gambling persistence, LDWs may potentially play an etiological role in the development of gambling problems over time...|$|R

5|$|In 1944, {{under the}} control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was {{deployed}} operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese. TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up to expectations, and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, without loss to the pilots of STAG-1.|$|E
5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and {{a structure that}} looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May, the Germans {{continued}} to attack Soviet {{positions in the}} north in localized offensives and by then, the Luftwaffe had gained air superiority over the Kharkov sector, forcing Timoshenko to move his own air assets forward in order to effectively counter the bolstered Luftflotte 4. The Luftwaffe won air superiority over their numerically superior, but technically inferior opponents. The air battles depleted the Soviet fighter strength, allowing the German strike aircraft the chance to influence the land battle even more. Nonetheless, the Soviet forces pushed on, disengaging from several minor battles and changing the direction of their thrusts. However, in the face <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> resistance and local counterattacks, the Soviet attack ebbed, especially when combined with the invariably heavy air raids. By {{the end of the}} day, the 28th Army could no longer conduct offensive operations against German positions.|$|E
