Another way to save the grated coconut residue is to saute them as serundeng.

The fundamental objectives of this study were to examine the methods for skim <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> production and comparison of its quality with normal <b>coconut</b> <b>milk.</b> The results of this study indicated that the UHT skim <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> can be prepared by separating fat through a cream separator, adding CMC and Montanox 60 at 0. 6 and 0. 6 %w/v respectively, two-stage homogenizing at 1, 500 / 500 psi, and then UHT sterilizing at 140 °C for 4 s (Fo ≈ 5 min). It appeared that the remaining fat content in skim <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> was less than 1 %. The addition of the CMC and Montanox 60 could obviously raise the stability of <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> emulsion and caused the increase of viscosity of the skim <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> specimen.

40|$|Background <b>Coconut</b> <b>milk</b> is an {{essential}} ingredient of the Indonesian cuisine. In view of its saturated fatty acid content, <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> has frequently been blamed {{as a cause of}} cardiovascular disease. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine any association between <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> intake and vascular disease among adults. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 - 2012 on adults aged 25 - 65 years. Self-reported health and nutritional data were collected by means of questionnaire-based interviews, with the aid of 3 -D food models. Medical data comprised blood pressure and anthropometry (waist circumference and body mass index), neurological status, ECG, blood glucose and lipid profile. Data analysis was done using multiple logistic regression. Results A total of 4, 187 respondents fullfilled the inclusion criteria. Frequent <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> intake (> 3 times/week) significantly increased the risk of vascular disease by 1. 3 -fold compared with infrequent <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> intake (< 2 times/week) (OR= 1. 33; 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 1. 60; p= 0. 002) after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and stress.

50|$|<b>Coconut</b> <b>milk</b> is {{traditionally}} made by grating the white inner flesh of a brown coconut and mixing the shredded coconut meat {{with a small}} amount of water in order to suspend the fat present in the grated meat. The grating process can be carried out manually or by comminution, a process that uses a more modern grating machine to facilitate the grating. <b>Coconut</b> <b>milk</b> exists in two grades: thick and thin. Thick <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> contains 20-22% fat while thin <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> contains 5-7% fat. Thick milk is prepared by directly squeezing grated coconut meat through cheesecloth. Thin milk is produced by soaking the squeezed coconut meat in water and further squeezing the meat until a thinner liquid forms. Thick milk contains soluble, suspended solids, which makes it a good ingredient for desserts and rich and dry sauces. Because thin milk does not contain these soluble solids, it is mainly used in general cooking. The distinction between thick and thin milk is not usually made in Western nations due to the fact that fresh <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> is uncommon in these countries and most consumers buy <b>coconut</b> <b>milk</b> in cartons or cans.|$|R
