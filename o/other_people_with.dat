25|$|In Asian folklore, foxes are {{depicted}} as a familiar spirit possessed of magic powers. Similar to Western folklore, foxes {{are depicted}} as mischievous, usually tricking <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> <b>with</b> the ability to disguise as an attractive female human. However, there are other depictions of foxes as a mystical, sacred creature, that can either bring wonder or ruin. Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale {{can be a good}} or a bad omen.

50|$|Negative affectivity {{increases}} {{the accuracy of}} social perceptions and inferences.

25|$|Self-esteem {{may make}} people {{convinced}} they deserve happiness. Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since {{the development of}} positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones. For Erich Fromm, love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those {{who are capable of}} loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for teaching professions.|$|E
25|$|Authority {{over what}} was to become known as Beek {{airfield}} (vliegveld Beek), was officially transferred to the Dutch government on 1 August 1945. It was decided to keep it open rather than re-open the pre-war debate over the location of an airport in the Maastricht area. The first civilian aircraft landed on 26 September 1945 and were operated by the Regeeringsvliegdienst, a government service with the purpose of carrying government officials and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> urgent business, because the war had left many roads and railroads heavily damaged. The service used six de Havilland Dragon Rapides made available by the British government.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as group homes) with <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence {{of this type of}} support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the Texas State Schools. The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.|$|E

25|$|Many {{patients}} who have had the surgical procedure report their improvements on social media websites such as structured patient databases and YouTube. Such stories are only anecdotal evidence of efficacy, and do not constitute a scientific proof of {{the efficacy of the}} treatment since, for example, those who have had a positive result are more prone to post their cases than those who had little or no improvement, and the reported improvements in patients' condition {{can be attributed to the}} placebo effect. Patients' reasons for not publishing negative results may include embarrassment about the money spent in the procedure without effect and the negative reaction they expect from <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> MS. Caution has been recommended regarding patients' self-reports found on the web.|$|E
25|$|After {{the liberation}} of Norway on 8 May 1945, the Norwegian Civil Aviation Board started to {{initiate}} operations of civilian airliners. For 1945, the task {{was given to the}} Royal Norwegian Air Force, who used surplus aircraft to operate a limited number of routes. At the same time, Thomas Olsen and Thomas Falck started mobilizing among shipowners and other businesspeople to raise capital for DNL, {{while at the same time}} trying to ensure the employment of military pilots, navigation officers and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> aviation competence. Egil Gløersen was sent to the United States to study the operations of United Airlines and Northwest Airlines. On a meeting on 17 July, Norway's nine largest shipping companies agreed to raise NOK15 to 20 million in share capital, and the company to join IATA.|$|E
25|$|A {{biography}} of Rollo, {{written by the}} cleric Dudo of Saint-Quentin in the late 10th Century, claimed that Rollo was from Denmark. One of Rollo's great-grandsons and a contemporary of Dudo was known as Robert the Dane. However, Dudo's Historia Normannorum (or Libri III de moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum) was commissioned by Rollo's grandson, Richard I of Normandy and– while Dudo likely had access to family members and/or <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> a living memory of Rollo– this fact must be weighed against the text's potential biases, as an official biography. According to Dudo, an unnamed king of Denmark was antagonistic to Rollo's family, including his father– an unnamed Danish nobleman– and Rollo's brother Gurim. Following the death of Rollo and Gurim's father, Gurim was killed and Rollo {{was forced to leave}} Denmark. Dudo appears to have been the main source for William of Jumièges (after 1066) and Orderic Vitalis (early 12th century), although both include additional details.|$|E

25|$|Supportive {{psychotherapy}} is {{also used}} in an inpatient or outpatient setting by a trained professional that focuses on areas such as coping skills, improvement of social skills and social interactions, communication, and self-esteem issues. People with SPD {{have a tendency to}} miss differences that causes an inability to pick up environmental cues and limits their experience. The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships. Their aloofness may limit their opportunities to refine the social skills and behavior necessary to effectively pursue relationships. Socialization groups may help people with SPD. Educational strategies in which people who have SPD identify their positive and negative emotions also may be effective. Such identification helps them to learn about their own emotions and the emotions they draw out from others and to feel the common emotions with <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> whom they relate. This can help people with SPD create empathy with the outside world.|$|E
