40|$|Most Escherichia coli {{promoters}} studied so far form stable <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> with sigma 70 -RNA polymerase {{which have}} relatively long half-lives and, therefore, {{are resistant to}} a competitor challenge. A few exceptions are nevertheless known. The analysis {{of a number of}} promoters in Bacillus subtilis has suggested that the instability of <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> formed by the vegetative sigma A-RNA polymerase may be a more general phenomenon than in Escherichia coli. We show that the main early and late promoters from the Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 form unstable <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> that are stabilized either by the formation of the first phosphodiester bond between the initiating nucleoside triphosphates or by DNA supercoiling. The functional characteristics of these two strong promoters suggest that they are not optimized for a tight and stable RNA polymerase binding. Their high activity is probably the consequence of the efficiency of further steps leading to the formation of an elongation complex...|$|R

The DNA migration retardation assay was demonstrated to be suitable for the detection and quantitation of <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> by the correspondence in the properties of <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> in solution and retarded complexes observed in gels. These included, on the ara promoter, heparin resistance, lifetime, DNAseI footprinting, exonuclease III footprinting, permanganate footprinting and disappearance upon transcription, and on the gal promoter, the correspondence between the kinetic parameters Kd and k 2 obtained with established techniques and those obtained with the migration retardation assay. On the pBAD promoter we obtained kinetic parameters of Kd = 0. 3 nM and k 2 = 1 minute− 1.

2500|$|For pol II-transcribed genes, {{and unlike}} {{bacterial}} RNA polymerase, promoter melting requires hydrolysis of ATP and is mediated by TFIIH. [...] TFIIH is a ten-subunit protein, including both ATPase and protein kinase activities. While the upstream promoter DNA {{is held in}} a fixed position by TFIID, TFIIH pulls downstream double-stranded DNA into the cleft of the polymerase, driving the separation of DNA strands and the transition of the preinitiation complex from the closed to open state. TFIIB aids in <b>open</b> <b>complex</b> formation by binding the melted DNA and stabilizing the transcription bubble.|$|E
2500|$|After binding to the DNA, the RNA {{polymerase}} switches from {{a closed}} complex to an <b>open</b> <b>complex.</b> [...] This change involves {{the separation of}} the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the transcription bubble. [...] Ribonucleotides are base-paired to the template DNA strand, according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions. [...] Supercoiling plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA. [...] Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils. [...] Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.|$|E
40|$|A cryptic promoter, {{designated}} P alpha, initiates transcription {{within the}} O(R) region of bacteriophage lambda. Transcription from P alpha proceeds {{in the direction}} of the cI repressor gene from sites 46 and 48 bp preceding the PRM transcription start site. P alpha is likely to compete with both PR and PRM for formation of <b>open</b> <b>complexes,</b> since it is only active when PR is mutated and can be suppressed by mutations that increase PRM activity. In addition, transcription initiation at P alpha is blocked by lambda repressor. Kinetic analysis of relative abundance of the products of in vitro transcription indicated that P alpha was approximately 1 / 3 as strong as PRM. However, a P alpha mutation had little effect on KBkf (the association rate constant) for PRM. These observations can be explained by the finding that <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> formed at P alpha are relatively unstable (half-life = 20 to 25 min). Dissociation of RNA polymerase from P alpha allows additional <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> to form at PR or PRM, and thus the apparent strength of P alpha decreases with increasing preincubation times...|$|R
40|$|An {{activated}} transcription {{system was}} constructed using substantially purified liver factors, Hela TFIID and GAL 4 -VP 16. The system {{was used to}} study the relationship between RNA polymerase II large subunit phosphorylation and other ATP-dependent processes occurring during activated transcription. When C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase activity was inhibited, activator dependent <b>open</b> promoter <b>complex</b> formation proceeded normally. These <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> could function to produce RNA {{in the absence of}} CTD phosphorylation, although the level of RNA produced was changed somewhat. The results demonstrate that RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation is not generally required for the formation of activator-dependent, functional <b>open</b> promoter <b>complexes.</b> Taken together with prior results the experiments suggest that a requirement for CTD phosphorylation may be situation-dependent and thus serve a regulatory function...|$|R
40|$|The sigma(S) subunit of RNA {{polymerase}} is {{the master}} regulator of the general stress response in Escherichia coli and is required for promoter recognition of many stationary phase genes. We have analysed <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> of Esigma(S) RNA polymerase, using sigma(S) derivatives carrying single cysteine residues at nine different positions to which the reagent FeBABE has been tethered. All holoenzymes but one formed transcriptionally active <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> at three different promoters (osmY, galP 1 and lacUV 5). The chemical nuclease FeBABE can cleave DNA in proximity to the chelate. The overall cutting pattern of Esigma(S) <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> {{does not depend on}} the nature of the promoter and is similar to that obtained with Esigma(70), but extends towards the downstream part of the promoter. The strongest cleavages are observed with FeBABE positioned on cysteines in regions 2. 2 to 3. 1. In contrast to sigma(70), region 2. 1 of sigma(S) appears to be far from DNA. Region 4. 2 of sigma(S) appears less accessible than its counterpart in sigma(70) and FeBABE positioned in the turn of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in region 4. 2 reacts only weakly with the - 35 promoter element. This provides a structural basis for the minor role of the - 35 sequence in sigma(S) -dependent promoter recognition...|$|R
2500|$|Transcription {{elongation}} {{involves the}} further addition of ribonucleotides {{and the change}} of the <b>open</b> <b>complex</b> to the transcriptional complex. [...] RNAP cannot start forming full length transcripts because of its strong binding to the promoter. Transcription at this stage primarily results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in {{a process known as}} abortive transcription. [...] Once the RNAP starts forming longer transcripts it clears the promoter. [...] At this point, the contacts with the -10 and -35 elements are disrupted, and the σ factor falls off RNAP. [...] This allows the rest of the RNAP complex to move forward, as the σ factor held the RNAP complex in place.|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, RNA {{polymerase}} makes {{contacts with}} the promoter region. [...] However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. [...] Once the <b>open</b> <b>complex</b> is stabilized, RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA strand to establish a DNA-RNA heteroduplex (~8-9 bp) at the active center, which stabilizes the elongation complex. [...] In order to accomplish RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [...] "scrunching" [...] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex. During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a [...] "stressed intermediate." [...] Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. [...] Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough, RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. However, promoter escape {{is not the only}} outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription. [...] The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [...] Scientists have coined the term [...] "abortive initiation" [...] to explain the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition. [...] The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} {{potassium}} permanganate as a probe to detect DNA duplex unwinding in vitro, in <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> between E. coli RNA polymerase and DNA fragments carrying the E. coli galactose operon regulatory region. This zone contains 3 overlapping promoters which specify transcription initiation at 3 distinct startpoints.

This has allowed us to compare duplex unwinding in <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> at the 3 different promoters, and to show that the extent of the unwinding is similar in each case. Further, the pattern of DNA modification by potassium permanganate suggests a model for discrimination between the upper and lower strands.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{formation}} of <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> between purified RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli and DNA fragments carrying the galP 1 promoter, a promoter with an extended - 10 region. Unusually, these complexes are formed readily at low temperatures. This low-temperature opening is unaffected by deletions of either upstream or downstream promoter sequences. We conclude that low-temperature open-complex formation is due to specific base sequences in and just upstream of the extended - 10 region. In contrast, <b>open</b> <b>complexes</b> are not formed at low temperatures with DNA fragments carrying the E. coli cysG promoter, which also has an extended - 10 region. This demonstrates that an extended - 10 sequence alone is not sufficient for low-temperature opening. Additionally, we report the temperature dependence of a hybrid galP 1 -cysG promoter, the related galP 2 and galP 3 promoters and a derivative of galP 1 with an improved - 10 hexamer sequence...|$|R
