5|$|Breckinridge {{intended}} to begin practicing law in Lexington, Kentucky, but he enlisted for {{service in the}} War of 1812 instead. After the war, he opened his practice and {{was elected to the}} Kentucky House, where he led an unsuccessful attempt to oust Gabriel Slaughter after he ascended to the governorship upon the death of George Madison. He served as Speaker of the House from 1817 to 1819, and was appointed as Adair's Secretary of State in 1820. He moved to Frankfort, the state capital, so that he could attend to the duties <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> but fell ill with a fever in August 1823 and died in office on September 1.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke decided not to run for {{re-election}} in 1883. He was losing too much support due to his ties with the Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> Frank told Lee {{that he had}} not yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War {{provided}} a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare, and Mallory was {{in position to}} provide support for many of them. His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name, but he encouraged the development of several other weapons. For example, he favored the use of rifled guns, {{as opposed to the}} smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy. The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Office</b> of Ordnance and Hydrography, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke. The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Nina asks Thomas {{to reconsider}} choosing {{her to play}} the role. When he forcibly kisses her, she bites him before running out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and discovers, much to her surprise and that of her overprotective mother Erica, {{that she will be}} portraying the lead.

50|$|A fiscal conservative, Husted cut <b>his</b> <b>office’s</b> {{budget by}} $14.5 million {{during his first}} term and reduced the size <b>of</b> <b>his</b> staff by one-third. After running a surplus {{for the first six}} years <b>of</b> <b>his</b> two terms as Secretary of State, he made the {{unprecedented}} request to have 100% <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office’s</b> taxpayer funding cut for the remainder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> term, opting instead to spend down <b>his</b> <b>office’s</b> savings.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the death}} of the last Stuart monarch, Queen Anne, Welton refused to take the oath of {{allegiance}} to the new Hanoverian king George I in October 1714. He was therefore deprived <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> on 3 March 1715.|$|R
5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> of lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand the power <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> marking {{a turning point in}} post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding {{in the back seat}} of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E
5000|$|Pomponius Rufus {{is known}} {{primarily}} from inscriptions. Although a cursus honorum is lacking for this individual, several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> are documented from military diplomas and an inscription {{from the northern}} precinct of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.|$|R
50|$|The Bourbon Restoration {{government}} stripped him <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> and dignities, and {{he became}} mayor of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre in April 1816. He recovered the title of Peer in 1832, following the July Revolution of 1830. He died in Bursard, Orne.|$|R
50|$|With {{the coming}} to power of the Nazis, Boden's career was {{initially}} ended. He was relieved <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> and retired. Despite being prosecuted and defamed by the Nazis and bombed twice in 1942 and 1944, the family survived the reign of terror.|$|R
5|$|Bush twice invoked , {{which allows}} a President to {{temporarily}} transfer the powers and duties <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> to the Vice President who then becomes Acting President. On June 29, 2002, Bush underwent a colonoscopy and chose to invoke Section 3 of the amendment, making Vice President Dick Cheney the Acting President. The medical procedure began at 7:09am. EDT and ended at 7:29am. EDT. Bush woke up twenty minutes later, {{but did not}} resume his presidential powers and duties until 9:24am. EDT after the president's doctor, Richard Tubb, conducted an overall examination. Tubb said he recommended the additional {{time to make sure}} the sedative had no after effects. On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 in response to having to undergo a colonoscopy, again making Vice President Cheney the Acting President. Bush invoked Section 3 at 7:16am. EDT. He reclaimed his powers at 9:21am. EDT. In both cases, Bush specifically cited Section 3 when he transferred the Presidential powers to the Vice President and when he reclaimed those powers.|$|E
5|$|By 1665, he was {{collecting}} information for his county history, The Antiquities of Berkshire; and in 1672 he published The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, a lavish folio with illustrations by Wenceslaus Hollar, {{for which he}} had conducted years of research. An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the King of Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and the Elector Palatine. Ashmole performed the heraldic and genealogical work <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the power}} {{struggle}} after Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev {{emerged as the}} country's new leader. In a secret speech he gave in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his domestic policies largely loosened the government's grip over the country. Khrushchev put more resources into the production of consumer goods and housing. Almost immediately, Armenia underwent a cultural and economic rebirth. Religious freedom, to a limited degree, was granted to Armenia when Catholicos Vazgen I assumed the duties <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> in 1955. One of Khrushchev's advisers and close friends, Armenian Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, urged Armenians to reaffirm their national identity. In 1954, he gave a speech in Yerevan where he encouraged them to republish the works of writers such as Raffi and Charents. The massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops literally overnight and replaced in 1962 with that of Mother Armenia. Contacts between Armenia and the Diaspora were revived, and Armenians from abroad began to visit the republic more frequently.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{increased}} <b>his</b> <b>office's</b> {{focus on}} Native American issues. He worked {{the night shift}} with tribal police officers, conducted leadership training for Native American youth, and implemented a new statewide community based prosecution strategy. His focus resulted {{in an increase in}} prosecutions. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office's</b> high-profile prosecutions include a 17-person drug conspiracy in Pine Ridge known as Operation Prairie Thunder.|$|R
50|$|His {{best man}} was Henry Hermand (1924-2016), a {{businessman}} who loaned €550,000 to Macron {{for the purchase}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances. Hermand also let Macron use some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> on the Avenue des Champs Élysées in Paris for his movement En Marche!.|$|R

5|$|He {{was elected}} unopposed in 1796, {{but did not}} stand for the borough in 1802. Though a friend of Pitt's government, he rarely {{attended}} the House; George Rose commented in a letter that Villiers's loss would have {{no impact on the}} Tories. While a member of parliament, in 1798, he married Lord Boringdon's daughter, Theresa, who would bear him ten children over the next two decades. After leaving Parliament, Villiers continued his presence at Court, and carried messages from the Princess Royal in Stuttgart to the king. In 1803, the duties <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> as paymaster were extended, and on 9 May, he was reappointed as Paymaster and Inspector-General of Marines, with a salary of £1,000 p.a. In the same year, he was commissioned a captain in the Watford Volunteer Cavalry. Villiers was prepared to intercede with the king on behalf of Pitt to fulfill the latter's desire for a more comprehensive ministry, which, however, was frustrated; and to bring Pitt's friends into the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Danny Greene and his {{childhood}} friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen at the Cleveland docks. Meanwhile, the members are exploited by corrupt union boss, Jerry Merke {{and the leadership}} of the ILA union urges Greene to run against him. Meanwhile, Sneperger can't pay a gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia Capo John Nardi. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the union leader out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> and is later elected union president. He improves the working conditions at the docks while continuing his dealings with Nardi.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} {{the activities and}} scope <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> building a parallel state. This soon started a conflict with Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor of reducing the funds for social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading them to vote for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E
