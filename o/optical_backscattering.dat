40|$|Abstract- Unmanned {{underwater}} vehicles (UUVs) {{are increasingly}} being used as efficient and cost-effective Intelligent Preparation of the Operational Environment (IPOE) platforms by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), which seeks to provide Bat-tlespace on Demand to the US Navy warfighter. One such UUV, the Teledyne/Webb Slocum Electric Glider, was utilized during four US Naval exercises {{in the past year}} to provide environmental data in support of Navy operations. Folding Slocum Glider missions into tactical operations has numerous benefits: the Slocum Glider (1) provides high-resolution optical and physical data in shallow coastal environments in real-time, (2) maintains a low profile when surfaced, (3) is piloted remotely with minimal manpower, (4) can be dep-loyed over-the-horizon, and (5) reduces the amount of time an asset spends off-mission for the sake of IPOE measurements. Environ-mental data include sound velocity profiles, water clarity, and current velocity. The scientific payload for the Slocum Gliders in the NAVOCEANO glider inventory consists of a CTD probe and an <b>optical</b> <b>backscattering</b> sensor. Sound velocity profiles are derived from the CTD, water clarity is inferred from the backscattering data, and depth-averaged currents are determined by offsets between sub-surface dead-reckoning position estimates and actual surface Global Positioning System (GPS) position fixes. One issue pertaining to the optical data {{is that many of the}} optical products utilized are based on beam attenuation and not <b>optical</b> <b>backscattering.</b> Conse-quently, <b>optical</b> <b>backscattering</b> data from the NAVOCEANO Slocum glider data must be converted to beam attenuation to be utilized for algorithms that create optical products.

Data are provided by filtration techniques, <b>Optical</b> <b>BackScattering</b> (OBS) measurements and in situ laser diffraction particle sizing. The concentration of suspended particles increased from reef to land. A bottom nepheloid layer occurred over the entire lagoon. and was more distinct on the nearshore area. Small particles were more abundant in the bottom nepheloid layer than in the overlying water column. The concentration of suspended particles showed more variability over space than over time. Conversely. the particle size distribution of suspended particles showed more variability at a given location over a month (time variability) than at a given moment over the lagoon (space variability). Analysis showed that aggregates represented a large fraction of suspended particles. Microscope visualization and chemical analysis of a sample suggest {{the inclusion of a}} transparent exopolymeric matrix. The relative abundance of aggregates over suspended particle volume concentration was found to increase as tire quantity of suspended particle decreased. The spatial distribution of the relative abundance of aggregates suggests more aggregates proximal to coral reefs. The high concentration of aggregates at low turbidity and the spatial distribution of the relative abundance, infer that aggregation is induced by the presence of organic ligands.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Summertime, wind-driven {{upwelling}} off the Oregon coast delivers nutrient rich {{water to}} the surface that fuels the autotrophic production of particulate organic carbon (POC). This POC can be transported horizontally by fluid motions and vertically by sinking to the bottom {{where it can be}} entrained in the benthic boundary layer (BBL). POC can be transformed during transport by heterotrophic metabolism, thus changing its concentration and composition. To better understand the dynamics of POC within the water column of this highly variable system, we developed a semi-automated filtration system that, when coupled to a towed profiling/sampling vehicle, allowed us to collect POC samples at higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. During late May of 2009 we used this system to collect around 400 POC samples from two cross-shelf transects off the central Oregon coast spanning the ranges between BBL and surface mixed layer, and shelfbreak to shoreline. These samples were collected in conjunction with in-situ measurements of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, <b>optical</b> <b>backscatter,</b> and beam attenuation coefficients. Analyses of both the optical and bulk measurements indicate the presence of three distinct particle pools. The first pool is rich in POC and shows elevated fluorescence and beam-c relative to <b>optical</b> <b>backscatter.</b> The second pool is elevated in both fluorescence and <b>optical</b> <b>backscatter,</b> and is rich in POC relative to beam-c. The third pool is depleted in POC and shows proportionately elevated backscatter. Using variations in the optical properties of these three particle pools, we created multiple POC – beam-c calibrations, which allowed us to derive high-resolution POC distributions within the water column. This derived distribution indicates a decoupling between sediment and carbon in the BBL, and an unanticipated elevation of POC in the mid water column...|$|R

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>backscatter</b> sensors (OBS) {{have been}} used to {{estimate}} in situ concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in aquatic systems for about 20 years. The logical next step is to use the differential responses to varying sizes and composition of the particles across a range of wavelengths to characterize discrete mixtures of sediments. To do this, we examined the response of the backscatter coef®cients in the optical range 442 ± 671 nm to de®ned mixtures of suspended quartz and carbonate sands in a turbulent jet. We found positive linear responses of the backscatter coef®cient to the amount of suspended sand at all wavelengths. The regressions differed among the wavelengths for mixture constituents, but analyses of error propagation indicated that concentration prediction using mixture component calibration curves was problematic. When the colour of the sand was changed, the response of backscatter to concentration at some of the wavelengths changed and errors in prediction of mixture concentration were low. Thus, the differential <b>optical</b> <b>backscatter</b> response of sediment components can provide a means to estimate suspended sediment concentrations in the ®eld from individual calibration equations when the components are different colours.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative {{identification}} of brain tumors and tumor margins {{has been limited}} by either {{the resolution of the}} in vivo imaging technique or the time required to obtain histological specimens. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a high-resolution, real-time intraoperative imaging technique to identify an intracortical melanoma. INSTRUMENTATION: OCT is a new, noncontact, high-speed imaging technology capable of resolutions on the micrometer scale. OCT is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging, except that reflections of infrared 1 ight, rather than sound, are detected. OCT uses inherent tissue contrast, rather than enhancement with dyes, to differentiate tissue types. The compact, fiberoptic-based design is readily integrated with surgical instruments. METHODS: A portable handheld OCT surgical imaging probe has been constructed for imaging within the surgical field. Cadaveric human cortex with metastatic melanoma was harvested and imaged in two and three dimensions.

Articular surfaces of horse intercarpal joints, featuring both intact tissue and spontaneously healed chondral or osteochondral defects, were imaged ex vivo with arthroscopic ultrasound and laboratory OCT devices. Quantitative ultrasound (integrated reflection coefficient (IRC), apparent integrated backscattering coefficient (AIB) and ultrasound roughness index (URI)) and optical parameters (optical reflection coefficient (ORC), optical roughness index (ORI) and <b>optical</b> <b>backscattering</b> (OBS)) were determined and compared with histological integrity and mechanical properties of the tissue. Spontaneously healed tissue could be quantitatively discerned from the intact tissue with ultrasound and OCT techniques. Furthermore, several significant correlations (p< 0. 05) were detected between ultrasound and OCT parameters. Superior resolution of OCT provided a more accurate measurement of cartilage surface roughness, while the ultrasound backscattering from the inner structures of the cartilage matched better with the histological findings. Since the techniques were found to be complementary to each other, dual modality imaging techniques could provide a useful tool for the arthroscopic evaluation of the integrity of articular cartilage.
