[...] The multiplayer they praised for being more pleasingly simple than recent Call of Duty games and pointed <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was sure to bring considerable nostalgia to players of the original, but nonetheless criticized it for feeling limited and shallow. They also noted that the remaster inadvertently felt clichéd and overfamiliar, due to the original having inspired numerous sequels and imitations, but praised the modern-day setting as feeling surprisingly fresh again. Metro summarized their review by saying [...] "One of the most influential video games of all time gets the remaster it deserves, and is still impressively entertaining after all these years." ...|$|E

"Wind It Up", the album's lead single, {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics {{for its use}} of yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music, but was moderately successful, peaking inside the top 10 in the US and the UK. The title track was well received and was a major success, reaching the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

[...] IGN's Diana Steenbergen also praised Beaver, calling Bobby [...] "a valuable member of the team" [...] that [...] "broadens [...] tight-knit unit, reminding them that there is more to family than just blood ties". She found the actor to be [...] "fantastic as the broken Bobby" [...] in the fifth season, [...] "despondent over his situation and feeling useless". Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver has done an outstanding job portraying his journey. Not solely a surrogate father figure and keeper of random supernatural knowledge, this season Bobby has run the gamut of sacrifice, loss, anger, and determination to keep fighting." [...] After watching Bobby confess his suicidal thoughts to Dean in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", she felt that [...] "Beaver conveys all of Bobby's vulnerability and also the shame that comes from being reprimanded by Dean for wanting to give up".|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} cases, Yamazaki would usually {{come up with}} the twist of the case first; he would think of {{something}} shocking or a surprising event, as well as the setting and set-up of the episode. He would then figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> could logically have happened, which he said was the most compelling method, story-wise; if it were done in the other direction – starting with how the case would work logically and then adding a twist - he found that it would not [...] "ring true". He found that coming up with ways of resolving these mysteries was very difficult compared to coming up with the set-up. He worked towards including story developments that would [...] "keep [...] guessing", and puzzles that [...] "appeal to their curiosity". He tried to create scenarios that make the player interested, which resulted in the bombing in the first episode and how the second episode's murderer appears to be a mythical creature. Among scrapped ideas for the episodes were a case of an [...] "ethereal murder" [...] where the suspect remembers killing someone but there is no body and no evidence of it even happening, and a case where a doll has been killed. He noted that these ideas, while having an impact and sounding interesting, were unrealistic and would not work. Yamazaki took inspirations from several different kinds of stories, including books, movies and television; the second episode in particular was inspired by the works of the author Natsuhiko Kyogoku.|$|E

Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've got such a classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10.

[...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money".

2500|$|The {{contrast}} {{between them is}} perhaps most forcibly realised when Gloucester dies in Act 3, Scene 2. Margaret makes a speech in which she points <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is unfair to accuse Suffolk of the murder simply because Suffolk and Gloucester were enemies, as she and Gloucester's wife were enemies too, so if Suffolk is a suspect, so should she be one as well; [...] "Ay me unhappy,/To be a queen, and crowned with infamy" [...] (70–71). Again, she is turning events to focus on herself. Henry however, completely ignores her, calling out sorrowfully; [...] "Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man" [...] (72). This situation is repeated during the Cade rebellion, but this time they ignore one another. After the rebels deliver their terms to Henry, he tells Buckingham he will speak with Cade, but Margaret is concerned only with herself and Suffolk (whose head she is now carrying). Speaking to the head she ignores Henry's problems and exclaims, [...] "Ah barbarous villain! Hath this lovely face/Ruled like a wandering planet over me,/And could it not enforce them to relent,/That were unworthy to behold the same?" [...] (4.4.14–17). Henry however ignores this, and continues {{to deal with the}} rebel demands, saying simply, [...] "Lord Saye, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head" [...] (4.4.18).

2500|$|On March 5, 1985, ABA {{founder and}} President Merl Mennenga {{with the loss}} of {{membership}} and tracks (in part because of rising insurance cost of liability), the ABA on the verge of bankruptcy and personal burnout and exhaustion-and possibly with the Pico Rivera incident on his mind, announced he had sold the ABA to Bernie Anderson and Jamie Vargas, two wealthy ABA track operators, for a reported $250,000 (paid out over several years) and resigned as owner and President of the ABA. Vargas was a computer consultant from Louisiana who ran the first track in Louisiana. Anderson owned a magazine subscription sales service who founded Rebel Racing, a regional BMX bicycle firm he started in 1980 and sold in 1982. He at one time operated the first successful track in Texas. Both men had sons who raced at the time. The new owners installed Walt Ehnat, who had just previously been a partner with Gary Ellis Sr. in running four tracks in the Seattle, Washington area (including one in Tacoma, Washington) as the new president. They reversed some questionable programs like having three separate point seasons in a year (as opposed to having one continuous season for about a year) meaning a racer would race for the lowest number he could get not once but three times). However, they decided to hold the remaining Pro Spectaculars despite the immediate financial gain it would cause by canceling them; the damage it would cause with their relations with the pros far out weighed in their view of any immediate financial benefit. They tried to stave off bankruptcy by paying off other debts, although declaring bankruptcy would have also helped the ABA immediately. As canceling the remaining Pro Spectaculars would have been bad policy regarding the pros, the new management felt that declaring bankruptcy would have put out a false impression to track operators around the country that the USBA would exploit. Despite all efforts and the Internal Revenue Service at the door and a reported liability to twenty creditors of $700,000 to $750,000. Most of the financial hemorrhaging was inflicted by the losses over Bicycles and Dirt magazine. Anderson and Vargas filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 25, 1985. Bankruptcy protection was not the end as many think, it simply allows a company to keep functioning while a disinterested third party, in this case the Federal courts to work <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would pay it debts. As predicted, the USBA tried {{to take advantage of the}} situation, with some success, by playing on the fears of track operators. Some tracks worried about the solvency of the ABA changed their affiliation to the USBA. The USBA tried to fan a stampede by calling individual track operators and citing the precarious position of the ABA with the publicly published court papers outlining the debts incurred by the ABA under Merl Mennenga. It attempted to generate among ABA track operators a sense of impending doom facing the ABA over its financial dire straits in order for them to change their affiliations to the point of harassment. [...] The father of pro racer Gary Ellis, Gary Ellis Sr., who ran the ABA-affiliated River Valley BMX track in Sumner, Washington, was a prized target for conversion. Rod Keeling, the founder and President of the USBA, went so far as to have a face-to-face meeting with Ellis to convince him to jump ship. Such a defection of a high-profile track operator would have been a large propaganda feather in Keeling's cap. He was not successful, in large part according to Mr. Ellis was that Keeling stressed the problems of the ABA, without stating how joining the USBA would be advantages to Mr. Ellis and BMX as a whole. However, Gary Ellis Sr. was of the opinion that bankruptcy was good for the ABA since it removed most of the top management that got the ABA into dire straits in the first place: ...|$|E
