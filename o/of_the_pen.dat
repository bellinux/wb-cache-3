5|$|In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park; however, {{some had}} died en route. The {{remaining}} elk {{were kept in}} a wired cage between Arden and Southfields. By 1935, some of the animals were still alive. However, by 1942, all of the elk had died.

5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> shell.

40|$|Odorant pens {{are used}} by medical {{practitioners}} and researchers to assess olfactory dysfunction. Despite their routine use, there are currently no data on the gas-phase odorant concentrations released from <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> tips or whether these concentrations scale linearly with the aqueous-phase concentrations inside <b>the</b> <b>pens.</b> <b>The</b> commercially available Sniffin’ Sticks odor threshold test containing n-butanol was chosen for evaluation. <b>The</b> gas-phase concentration <b>of</b> n-butanol at <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> each <b>pen</b> was measured directly in {{a new set of}} pens via proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Measurements were additionally made on <b>the</b> same <b>pens</b> after 6 months and two older pen sets, namely a 3 -year-old (used) and 4 -year-old (new) set. Furthermore, application-related tests were made to determine <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pens</b> during routine use and under stress. These data demonstrate that the gas-phase n-butanol concentrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threshold <b>pens</b> are linear over the entire set, both for brand-new pens and 6 months later; this reflects the expected performance that was previously only assumed. Furthermore, the application–simulation tests demonstrated a good performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pens</b> when used according to their intended protocol. Measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older <b>pen</b> sets suggest that storage conditions are more critical than usage for <b>pen</b> stability. <b>The</b> present findings confirm that <b>the</b> n-butanol odorant <b>pens</b> are an appropriate tool for threshold testing, provided they are stored and handled correctly...|$|R

5|$|Over time {{he became}} {{increasingly}} involved in various dissident organizations. In December 1959 {{he became a}} vice president of the Union of Polish Writers (Związek Literatów Polskich, ZLP). He also published in the magazine Świat (1951–1969). In 1962 he was the last president of the literary discussion society, Klub Krzywego Koła. In 1966 he was a vice president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PEN</b> Club. While in the late 1940s and 1950s he focused mostly on journalistic activity, later he turned to writing popular history in book format. In the 1960s he wrote his most famous works, historical books about history of Poland – the Kingdom of Poland in the times of the Piast dynasty, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and the era of elected kings (the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). His book on Jagiellonian Poland was recognized as the best book of the year by the readers.|$|E
5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) {{are called}} {{to the scene of}} an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} using a ball point within a writing {{instrument}} {{as a method of}} applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century.

50|$|A single Pass {{involves}} rotating a pen 0.5 {{times from}} one finger slot to another. When performing the Pass Normal on <b>the</b> palm-side <b>of</b> hand, <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> goes downward. When performing a Pass Normal on <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand, <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> goes upward. A small combination <b>of</b> Passes involving <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> rotating fully around the hand, starting and ending in the 12 slot, {{is called a}} Fingerpass, with the Fingerpass Normal being constructed out of Pass Normals. This short combo is consistently considered the hardest fundamental to master because Passes between the little finger and the ring finger are often difficult to make smooth. A Pass combo similar to a Fingerpass was performed by the character Boris Grishenko in the James Bond film GoldenEye, using only three fingers instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> usual four.|$|R

25|$|In 1963, in the {{aftermath}} of constitutional amendments by the Greek Cypriots which were rejected by the Turkish Cypriots, intercommunal violence broke out. Nicosia was divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot quarters by the Green Line, named after the colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> used by the United Nations officer to draw the line on a map of the city. This resulted in the ceasing of Turkish Cypriot participation in the government, and following more intercommunal violence in 1964, a number of Turkish Cypriots moved to the Turkish quarter of Nicosia, causing serious overcrowding.|$|E

Other poets included in this volume are Bedo Brwynllys, Dafydd Llwyd, Llywelyn ap Morgan, Dafydd ap Gwilym and Ieuan ap Howel. The assumption that this manuscript was written by Howel Davi is challenged by evidence, such as slips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> that occur in poems of Davi's composition, that suggest the scribe was copying these poems. With the exception of two sections (42 and 43), which are an attempt at transcription by an unskilled hand, the entire manuscript {{appears to be the}} work of one scribe (Peniarth MS 67).|$|E

25|$|They seem to {{have drawn}} on {{the map of the}} world {{published}} in Florence in 1489 by Henricus Martellus, in which provincia boëach appears as the southern neighbour of provincia ciamba. Book III of Marco Polo’s Il Milione described his journey by sea from China to India by way of Champa (= Southern Vietnam), Java (which he called Java Major), Locach and Sumatra (called Java Minor). After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing Java (which he did not visit himself). The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward Sumatra, but by a slip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen</b> the name “Java” was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa. Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise misplaced far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the Terra Australis.|$|E

25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pen.</b> Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E
