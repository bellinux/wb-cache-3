25|$|These {{conclusions}} can {{be generalized}} to treat cases with arbitrary Norton or Thévenin drives, arbitrary loads, and general two-port feedback networks. However, the results do depend upon the main amplifier having a representation as a two-port – that is, the results depend on the same current entering and leaving the input terminals, and likewise, the same current that leaves one <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> must enter the other <b>output</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> remains at battery voltage.|$|E
25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the spark gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave. Depending on how the spark gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so {{there are more than a}} hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the spark gap appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers from the top of the coil.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} sense are used, {{depending}} on where the power supply output is measured. In local sense, the supply simply measures the voltage at its <b>output</b> <b>terminals,</b> where the leads to the load connect. This method has the problem of not accounting for the voltage drop due to resistance of the leads, which {{is proportional to the}} amount of current drawn by the load. That is, the supply might be producing the correct voltage at its <b>output</b> <b>terminals,</b> but there will be a lower voltage at the input terminals of the load.|$|R
500|$|There {{is also a}} twin-T {{topology}} {{which has}} practical applications where it is desirable to have the input and output share a common (ground) terminal. [...] This may be, for instance, because the input and output connections are made with co-axial topology. [...] Connecting together an input and <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> is not allowable with normal bridge topology {{and for this reason}} Twin-T is used where a bridge would otherwise be used for balance or null measurement applications. [...] The topology is also used in the twin-T oscillator as a sine wave generator. [...] The lower part of figure 1.11 shows twin-T topology redrawn to emphasise the connection with bridge topology.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reported}} hazard of {{this practice}} is that arcs from the high voltage terminal often strike the primary winding of the coil. This momentarily creates a conductive path for the lethal 50/60Hz primary current from the supply transformer to reach the <b>output</b> <b>terminal.</b> [...] If a person {{is connected to the}} <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> at the time, either by touching it or allowing arcs from the terminal to strike his body, then the high primary current could pass through the conductive ionized air path, through the person's body to ground, electrocuting him.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the very}} first VSC-HVDC scheme {{installed}} (the Hellsjön experimental link commissioned in Sweden in 1997) until 2012, most of the VSC HVDC systems built {{were based on the}} two level converter. [...] The two-level converter is the simplest type of three-phase voltage-source converter and {{can be thought of as}} a six pulse bridge in which the thyristors have been replaced by IGBTs with inverse-parallel diodes, and the DC smoothing reactors have been replaced by DC smoothing capacitors. [...] Such converters derive their name from the fact that the voltage at the AC output of each phase is switched between two discrete voltage levels, corresponding to the electrical potentials of the positive and negative DC terminals. When the upper of the two valves in a phase is turned on, the AC <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> is connected to the positive DC terminal, resulting in an output voltage of +½ Ud with respect to the midpoint potential of the converter. [...] Conversely when the lower valve in a phase is turned on, the AC <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> is connected to the negative DC terminal, resulting in an output voltage of -½ Ud. [...] The two valves corresponding to one phase must never be turned on simultaneously, as this would result in an uncontrolled discharge of the DC capacitor, risking severe damage to the converter equipment.|$|E
40|$|A {{battery charger}} for {{incorporation}} into an electric-powered vehicle is disclosed. The charger includes a ferroresonant voltage-regulating circuit for providing an output voltage {{proportional to the}} frequency of an input AC voltage. A high frequency converter converts a DC voltage supplied, for example, from a rectifier connected to a standard AC outlet, to a controlled frequency AC voltage which is supplied to the input of the ferroresonant circuit. The ferroresonant circuit includes an output, a saturable core transformer connected across the output, and a first linear inductor and a capacitor connected in series across the saturable core transformer and tuned to resonate at the third harmonic of the AC voltage from the high frequency converter. The ferroresonant circuit further includes a second linear inductor connected between the input of the ferroresonant circuit and the saturable core transformer. The output voltage from the ferroresonant circuit is rectified and applied across a pair of <b>output</b> <b>terminals</b> adapted {{to be connected to}} the battery to be charged. A feedback circuit compares the voltage across the <b>output</b> <b>terminals</b> with a reference voltage and controls the frequency of the AC voltage produced by the high frequency converter to maintain the voltage across the <b>output</b> <b>terminals</b> at a predetermined value.

2500|$|The {{oscillating}} {{magnetic field}} of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding (L2), by Faraday's law of induction. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits {{is limited to the}} energy originally stored in the capacitor C1, so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude ("ring up") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero ("ring down"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance (C2), the sum of the parasitic capacitance between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode E. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> is much larger than the primary voltage.|$|E
2500|$|The 50/60Hz {{currents}} {{in the primary}} circuit of a Tesla coil are lethally dangerous, and require standard safety precautions used with other kilovolt electrical devices. [...] However, the high voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the <b>output</b> <b>terminal</b> pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. [...] The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10 – 20kHz. [...] It is thought {{that the reason for}} this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell's membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to transmit an impulse. [...] At radio frequencies, there is insufficient time during a half-cycle for enough ions to cross the membrane before the alternating voltage reverses. [...] The danger is that since no pain is felt, experimenters often assume the currents are harmless.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a high-efficiency single-input {{multiple}} output (SIMO) dc–dc converter. The proposed converter can boost the voltage of a low-voltage input power source to a controllable high-voltage dc bus and middle-voltage <b>output</b> <b>terminals</b> and low voltage <b>output</b> <b>terminals.</b> The high-voltage dc bus can take as the main power for a high-voltage dc load or the front terminal of a dc–ac inverter. Moreover, middle-voltage <b>output</b> <b>terminals</b> can supply powers for individual middle-voltage dc loads or for charging auxiliary power sources (e. g., battery modules). and low voltage can be used for charging battery. In this study, a coupled-inductor based dc–dc converter scheme utilizes only one power switch with the properties of voltage clamping and soft switching, and the corresponding device specifications are adequately designed. As a result, the objectives of high-efficiency power conversion, high stepup ratio, and various output voltages with different levels can be obtained. Also a series forward flyback converter is integrated to this converter for producing isolated output. Some experimental results via a kilowatt-level prototype are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SIMO dc–dc converter in practical applications [...] Keywords-High efficient,High voltage gain,; Flyback converter,series- forward flyback converter,SIMO converter I...|$|R
