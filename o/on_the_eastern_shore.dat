5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>shore</b> of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Shore</b> of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>shore,</b> disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E

The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise.|$|E

5|$|On September 19, Tropical Storm Isabel {{passed through}} extreme western Maryland, though its large {{circulation}} produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state. About 1.24million people lost power throughout the state. The worst of its effects came from its storm surge, which inundated areas {{along the coast}} and resulted in severe beach erosion. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Shore,</b> hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, primarily in Queen Anne's County from tidal flooding. Thousands of houses were affected in Central Maryland, with severe storm surge flooding reported in Baltimore and Annapolis. Washington, D.C., sustained moderate damage, primarily from the winds. Throughout Maryland and Washington, damage totaled about $945million (2003USD, ($ USD), with only one fatality due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Shore</b> of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean low water. Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} rapidly {{organized and}} attained tropical storm status with winds of 50mph (80km/h) just six hours after forming, upon {{which it was}} named Danielle. In response to an approaching trough, Danielle initially moved to the northeast. However, the trough outran the system, and a developing high pressure system to its north resulted in Danielle executing a tight, anticyclonic loop on September 23 to the 24th. The storm strengthened as it turned to the northwest, and reached a peak of 65mph (105km/h) winds on September 25 while just off the northeastern coast of North Carolina. Danielle turned to the north-northwest, and made landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Shore</b> of Virginia late on the 25th. It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26.|$|E
