25|$|Westbrook was {{reportedly}} offered {{the role of}} Natalie Buxton in the ITV prison series Bad Girls, but she declined because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> rebuilding operation. Dannielle Brent went on to play Natalie Buxton. Westbrook also turned down a small role in Footballers Wives {{and the role of}} money grabber Suzie Samson in ITV soap opera Crossroads. Emma Noble went on to portray Suzie Samson.|$|E
25|$|Kudrow {{attended}} Portola Middle School in Tarzana, California. In 1979, {{at the age}} of 16, she underwent rhinoplasty {{to reduce}} the size <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> She graduated from Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles where then N.W.A. member Eazy-E also attended. Kudrow received her Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Vassar College, intending to follow in her father's footsteps and research headaches. Kudrow worked on her father's staff for eight years while breaking into acting, earning a research credit on his study on the comparative likelihood of left-handed individuals developing cluster headaches.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{attempting}} {{to capture a}} realistic portrayal of the three, Utamaro idealizes their likenesses. [...] To many viewers, the faces in this and other portraits of the time seem little individuated, or perhaps not at all. Others emphasize the subtle differences that distinguish the three in {{the shapes of the}} mouths, noses, and eyes: [...] Kita has plump cheeks and an innocent expression; her eyes are almond-shaped, and the bridge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> high; [...] Hisa has a stiffer, proud expression, and the bridge of Hisa's nose is lower and her eyes rounder than Kita's; [...] Toyohina's features fall in between, and she has an air of being older and more intellectual.|$|E

500|$|Her mother {{started taking}} her to acting auditions. At once, Connelly was {{selected}} for a supporting role as the aspiring dancer and actress Deborah Gelly in Sergio Leone's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America. The role required performing a ballet routine. During the audition, Connelly, who had no ballet training, tried to imitate a ballerina. Her performance, and the similarity <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> to Elizabeth McGovern's, who played the character as an adult, convinced the director to cast her. Connelly described the movie as [...] "an incredibly idyllic introduction to movie-making". While Once Upon a Time in America was being filmed, Connelly made her first television appearance, in the episode [...] "Stranger in Town" [...] of the British series Tales of the Unexpected.|$|E
500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, {{by the time of}} this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E
2500|$|A {{profile in}} The New Yorker {{described}} Palin's oratorical style as [...] "simultaneously chatty and urgent," [...] {{and noted that}} [...] "she reinforces her words with winks and nods and wrinklings <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> that seem meant to telegraph intimacy and ease." [...] The article's author, Philip Gourevitch, characterized Palin as being [...] "high-spirited, irrepressible, {{and not in the}} least self-conscious." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Prince got up {{and went}} into her back-place, trying her 'ardest to {{remember}} wot she'd done with that broom. She couldn't find it anywhere, and at last she came back and sat staring at Joe for so long that 'e was 'arf frightened out of his life. And by-and-by she gave a 'orrible smile and sat rubbing the side <b>of</b> <b>'er</b> <b>nose</b> with <b>'er</b> finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thanks!" [...] {{said the}} girl sharply. Then she smiled maliciously. [...] "I daresay mother would, though; she’s fond <b>of</b> poking <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> into other people’s business." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} silence was only broken by the little angry sounds <b>of</b> Barbara blowing <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Princess Batcheat: A damsel in distress. Batcheat is the {{daughter}} of King Chattergy, ruler of Gup, and the fiancée of Prince Bolo. She is somewhat foolish; sentimental; reckless; and completely infatuated with Bolo, who is the only person to think her beautiful; all other characters have low opinions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> teeth, and singing voice. Most references (including, in one passage, those of the narration) to any of these, conclude [...] "... there's no need to go into that", and no exact description is given of Batcheat's face at all. Her name if pronounced [...] "Baat-cheat", is translated as [...] "conversation". When Princess Batcheat is captured by Chupwalas during an excursion to the border between Gup and Chup, they plot to sew her mouth shut and rename her Khamosh, meaning [...] "silent", but never carry this out.|$|E
2500|$|Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub {{his nose}} (which is being irritated by his glasses), {{realizes that the}} woman who {{allegedly}} saw the murder had impressions in the sides <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> indicating that she wore glasses, but did not wear them in court out of vanity. Other jurors, including Juror 4, confirm that they saw the same thing. Juror 8 adds {{that she would not}} have been wearing them while trying to sleep and points out that on her own evidence, the attack happened so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10, and 4 change their vote to [...] "not guilty", leaving only Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, which is ultimately why he wants the boy to be guilty. He finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of him and his son, but then breaks down crying and changes his vote to [...] "not guilty", making the vote unanimous. The jurors then leave the room to reveal their verdict to the court.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{physician}} Thomas Bond, {{disagreed with}} Brown's {{assessment of the}} killer's skill level. Bond's report to police stated: [...] "In each case the mutilation was inflicted by {{a person who had}} no scientific nor anatomical knowledge. In my opinion he does not even possess the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer or any person accustomed to cut up dead animals." [...] Local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, who was the first doctor at the scene, and City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy, also thought that the killer lacked anatomical skill and did not seek particular organs. In addition to the abdominal wounds, the murderer had cut Eddowes' face: across the bridge of the nose, on both cheeks, and through the eyelids of both eyes. The tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and part of one ear had been cut off. The Royal London Hospital on Whitechapel Road preserves some crime scene drawings and plans of the Mitre Square murder by the City Surveyor Frederick Foster; they were first brought to public attention in 1966 by Francis Camps, Professor of Forensic Medicine at London University. Based on his analysis of the surviving documents, Camps concluded that [...] "the cuts shown on the body could not have been done by an expert." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am not afraid!" [...] he piped.... Even his prized semi-bass {{voice had}} deserted him.... He {{rushed to the}} back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair and leaned over, confused, determined. Hastily he kissed her. The kiss landed on the tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cold <b>nose.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{very glad}} it's you, Sir!" [...] was Debby's cordial greeting, as she shook a {{drop off the}} end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> and nodded, smiling.|$|E

60|$|The {{reason why}} {{there had been}} space for this tete-a-tete can only be known by looking into the back kitchen, where Totty had been {{discovered}} rubbing a stray blue-bag against <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> {{and in the same}} moment allowing some liberal indigo drops to fall on her afternoon pinafore. But now she appeared holding her mother's hand--the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> round <b>nose</b> rather shiny from a recent and hurried application of soap and water.|$|R
6000|$|... "The place stinks like a den of skunks," [...] Mrs. Davis observed, pausing from dabbing the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> with a powder-puff. [...] "Dearest, we'll {{just have}} to wash them." ...|$|E

60|$|She stopped short, {{covered her}} face with both hands, and bending forward till she hid her {{confusion}} on her knees, went into an uncontrollable giggle, the only evidences of which, however, were the convulsive movements <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and an occasional squeak in the region <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>nose.</b>|$|R
