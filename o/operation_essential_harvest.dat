5|$|Macedonia is {{recognized}} {{under the name}} The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by NATO, though they note that Turkey recognizes the name Macedonia. The country joined the Partnership for Peace in 1995, and commenced its Membership Action Plan in 1999, {{at the same time}} as Albania. Participating in the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo, it received aid from NATO in dealing with refugees fleeing from Kosovo. In August 2001, NATO intervened in the 2001 insurgency, during which a rebel Albanian group, the National Liberation Army, fought government forces.

5|$|Though the {{campaign}} was criticized for high civilian casualties, including bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11June, Milošević further accepted UN resolution 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} canonical models {{for a number of}} logics of qualitative probabilities by introducing a conservative infinitary rule into their axiomatizations.

These operations capture some basic laws for stochastic processes into this new logic's semantics and are given a complete axiomatization. The paper also presents qualitative probabilistic versions of the modal logic techniques of unravelling and filtration. All the constructs and arguments in this paper are suitable to be combined with their counterparts for other propositional, e. g. modal logics, and can possibly be incorporated in proofs of completeness and decidability of logics containing both qualitative probabilistic and other propositional operators for application pur [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Battery {{electric}} vehicles (BEV) are envisioned {{to play a}} significant role in the future of personal mobility. A key challenge in the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) powered vehicles to BEV is the limited driving range of the latter, which makes an energy-efficient <b>operation</b> <b>essential.</b> In this work, we analyze how vehicle-to-x (V 2 X) communication, in particu-lar traffic-light-to-vehicle communication (TLVC), can help the drivers of BEVs save energy and thus increase driving range. Furthermore, we analyze factors impacting energy consumption which are relevant to the design of V 2 X applications for BEV. Our results indicate that TLVC can significantly reduce the energy consumption of BEV, up to 20 % in our setup. The actual result, however, is highly dependent on a combination of traffic situation, communication range, auxiliary consumer power demand, road gradient and minimum speed requirement. I...|$|R
