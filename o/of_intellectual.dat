5|$|The League of Nations had devoted serious {{attention}} {{to the question of}} international intellectual co-operation since its creation. The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation <b>of</b> <b>intellectual</b> work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee. The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions <b>of</b> <b>intellectual</b> life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection <b>of</b> <b>intellectual</b> property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.|$|E

The topics covered include the definitions <b>of</b> <b>intellectuals,</b> the debates on whether intellectuals constitute a universal class, and the role <b>of</b> <b>intellectuals</b> in the society, in particular intellectuals’ involvement in politics. The article then moves on to the literature on intellectuals’ political consciousness, and makes a call for a shift from a moralistic mission to an analytical approach, while suggesting a shift <b>of</b> the <b>intellectual</b> from an “independent variable” to a “dependent variable. ”</span...|$|R

5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars <b>of</b> <b>intellectual</b> giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing.

Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>intellectual</b> disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed by the lack <b>of</b> <b>intellectual</b> companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton {{kept in touch with}} Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
