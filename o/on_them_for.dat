As a result, several of Sora's enemies use his friends as bait to use the Keyblade for their purposes. During the first game, it is discovered that Sora {{was not meant to}} wield the Keyblade, which only chooses him in the absence of its intended owner, Riku. However, Sora's greater strength of heart causes the Keyblade to reject Riku in favor of Sora.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> {{a long period of time}} before asking them to participate.|$|E

On the {{recommendation}} of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 hard disk recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record them properly. The band felt less pressure <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> the new album, due to {{the success of}} International Velvet and because they no longer feared being dropped by the label.|$|E

Major east-west thoroughfares in Omaha include Fort, Ames, Maple, Blondo, Dodge, Pacific, Center, L, Q and Harrison streets. Major north-south thoroughfares in Omaha include North and South 24th streets, 30th street, Saddle Creek Road, and 72nd, 84th, 90th, and 120th streets. South 10th Street is important in South Omaha.|$|E
5|$|Burghs had unique layouts and {{economic}} functions. They were typically {{were surrounded by}} a palisade or possessed a castle, and usually had a marketplace, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross (market cross), beside houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. The foundations of around 15 burghs {{can be traced to}} the reign of David I and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from international trade they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general, burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands than nationally or internationally, relying <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} {{to make it}} appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E

5|$|Most of the burghs were on {{the east}} coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, {{including}} Aberdeen, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. Although in the southwest Glasgow was beginning to develop and Ayr and Kirkcudbright had occasional links with Spain and France, sea trade with Ireland was much less profitable. In addition to the major royal burghs this era saw the proliferation of lesser baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts; excluded from international trade, they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, relying <b>on</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> food and raw materials. The wool trade was a major export {{at the beginning of}} the period, but the introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the trade and it began to decline as an export from the early 15th century and despite a levelling off, there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-16th century Low Countries. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large scale cloth production and only poor quality rough cloths seem to have been significant.|$|E
