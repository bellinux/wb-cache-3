40|$|It {{is widely}} thought that {{grounding}} is a hyperintensional phenomenon. Unfortunately, the term ‘hyperintensionality’ {{has been doing}} double-duty, picking out two distinct phenomena. This paper clears up this conceptual confusion. We call the two resulting notions hyperintensionalityGRND and hyperintensionalityTRAD. While {{it is clear that}} grounding is hyperintensionalGRND, the interesting question is whether it is hyperintensionalTRAD. We argue that given well-accepted constraints on the logical form of grounding, to wit, that grounding is irreflexive and asymmetric, grounding is hyperintensionalTRAD only if one endorses a sentential <b>operator</b> <b>view</b> of grounding. We argue that proponents of the sentential <b>operator</b> <b>view</b> will need to distinguish two importantly different kinds of hyperintensionalityTRAD—weak and strong—and we offer them a way to do so...|$|E

Hybrid systems, i. e., {{dynamical}} systems combining discrete {{and continuous}} dynamics, {{have a complete}} axiomatization in differential dynamic logic relative to differential equations. Differential invariants are a natural induction principle for proving properties of the remaining differential equations. We study the equational case of differential invariants using a differential <b>operator</b> <b>view.</b> We relate differential invariants to Lie’s seminal work and explain important structural properties resulting from this view. Finally, we study the connection of differential invariants with partial differential equations {{in the context of}} the inverse characteristic method for computing differential invariants. ...|$|E

Results indicate that three physiological measurements can be used in combination to measure well-being to some extent, but that subjective data needs to be incorporated to support the individual perspective (due to that the meaning of data is subjective). By using these devices, physiological data can be measured and evaluated in real-time, which increases the possibility of studying operator emotion (or memory constructs).

30|$|We {{adopted the}} {{theoretical}} framework forwarded by Jacobs et al. [17], who defined relational thinking {{as a form}} of reasoning that entails looking at numbers and expressions holistically and noticing relations among them. The central feature of relational thinking hinges on understanding the meaning of the equal sign (“=”; [12, 22]), which indicates a relationship of equality between numbers or expressions [8, 17]. To engage successfully in relational thinking, students must first consider the number sentence as a whole, and then uncover relevant components and numerical relationships [32]. Without accurate conceptions of the equal sign in both canonical (e.g., 3 [*]+[*] 4 [*]=[*] 7) and noncanonical (e.g., 3 [*]+[*] 4 [*]=[*] 2 [*]+[*] 5) contexts, there is nothing upon which relational thinking can be based. Because misconceptions about the equal sign have been well documented [4, 5, 11, 19, 26, 27, 38], relational thinking is often compromised, even at the middle-school level, where the <b>operator</b> <b>view</b> remains prevalent [19, 21, 42].|$|E
40|$|Given {{a random}} vector View the MathML source, we address the {{question}} of linear separability of View the MathML source, that is, the task of finding a linear <b>operator</b> <b>View</b> the MathML source such that we have View the MathML source with statistically independent random vectors View the MathML source. As this requirement alone is already fulfilled trivially by View the MathML source being independent of the empty rest, we require that the components be not further decomposable. We show that if View the MathML source has finite covariance, such a representation is unique up to trivial indeterminacies. We propose an algorithm based on this proof and demonstrate its applicability. Related algorithms, however with fixed dimensionality of the subspaces, have already been successfully employed in biomedical applications, such as separation of fMRI recorded data. Based on the presented uniqueness result, {{it is now clear that}} also subspace dimensions can be determined in a unique and therefore meaningful fashion, which shows the advantages of independent subspace analysis in contrast to methods like principal component analysis...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have considered segmentation in the tourism context and these efforts have {{enabled us to}} understand the bases that tourism destinations can use to segment markets and the bases that are more accurate predictors of future tourist behaviour. To date, all studies have used tourist data to profile the tourists travelling to a destination and most studies have used quantitative data. Addressing a key gap in the literature, this research sought to understand how tourist operators actually segment their market. Twelve tourism operators (activity operators, accommodation providers, destination marketing organisations and other stakeholders) were interviewed in one regional Australian tourism destination. Results indicated that different segmentation bases were used by different tourism operators. Activities sought, location, age, and trip purpose were the variables most frequently used by tourism operators to describe tourists. A tourist <b>operator</b> <b>view</b> is important because tourist operators can describe the tourists that are currently using their services. Given that different tourist operators attract different tourists, insights from these tourism operators can be compared with tourist data, thus enabling researchers {{to determine if they}} are adequately describing the tourists travelling to a destination.

30|$|Difficulties {{with the}} equal sign and {{relational}} thinking more broadly are {{not confined to}} the early grades. At the sixth-grade level, {{it has been shown that}} a majority of students have trouble finding the missing number that would make a noncanonical expression, such as 8 [*]+[*] 4 [*]=[*]□[*]+[*] 5, true [11, 19, 31]. In fact, Falkner et al. [11] found that of the 145 participating sixth graders, none correctly placed the number 7 in the box in the above expression (similar results were revealed by Li et al. [23]). Further, Knuth et al. [22] asked students from the sixth to the eighth grade to name and define the equal sign in the expression  3 [*]+[*] 4 [*]=[*] 7. The authors found that only 32 % of the sixth graders, 43 % of the seventh graders, and 31 % of the eighth graders offered a relational definition of the equal sign. Such difficulties with the equal sign may be due to the almost exclusive use of canonical equations in student textbooks [7, 28]. In an evaluation of four middle-school textbooks, McNeil et al. [28] concluded that the infrequent use of noncanonical equations may be responsible for reinforcing students’ <b>operator</b> <b>view</b> of the equal sign at the middle-school level [28].|$|E

The phenomena are covered from different angles including the main algorithms, protocols and application programs, the content, the <b>operator</b> <b>view,</b> legal issues, the economic aspects and the user point of view. Most papers are based on literature review including the latest sources on the web, some contain limited simulations and a few introduce new ideas on aspects of the phenomena under scrutiny. Before presenting the papers we will try to give some economic and social background to the phenomena. Overall, the selection of papers provides a good overview of the two phenomena providing light into {{what is happening in the}} Internet today. Finally, we provide a short discussion on where the development is taking us and how we should react to these new phenomena. Acknowledgements My interest in Peer-to-peer traffic and applications originates in the discussions that took place in the Special Interest Group on Broadband networks hosted within the TEKES NETS program during 2003. In particular, I would like to thank Pete Helenius of Rommon for his insights. The Broadband group organised an open seminar in Dipoli on November 20 th that brought the topic into a wider discussion involving people from both the networking side as well as the content business. I would also like to acknowledge the inspiring discussions with Juha Oinonen and Klaus Lindberg of CSC and Funet on the subject of peer-to-peer traffic and applications. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{characterizes the}} {{benefits}} of averaging techniques widely {{used in conjunction with}} stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, this work sharply analyzes: (1) mini-batching, a method of averaging many samples of the gradient to both reduce the variance of a stochastic gradient estimate and for parallelizing SGD and (2) tail-averaging, a method involving averaging the final few iterates of SGD in order to decrease the variance in SGD's final iterate. This work presents the first tight non-asymptotic generalization error bounds for these schemes for the stochastic approximation problem of least squares regression. Furthermore, this work establishes a precise problem-dependent extent to which mini-batching can be used to yield provable near-linear parallelization speedups over SGD with batch size one. These results are utilized in providing a highly parallelizable SGD algorithm that obtains the optimal statistical error rate with nearly the same number of serial updates as batch gradient descent, which improves significantly over existing SGD-style methods. Finally, this work sheds light on some fundamental differences in SGD's behavior when dealing with agnostic noise in the (non-realizable) least squares regression problem. In particular, the work shows that the stepsizes that ensure optimal statistical error rates for the agnostic case must be a function of the noise properties. The central analysis tools used by this paper are obtained through generalizing the <b>operator</b> <b>view</b> of averaged SGD, introduced by Defossez and Bach (2015) followed by developing a novel analysis in bounding these operators to characterize the generalization error. These techniques may be of broader interest in analyzing various computational aspects of stochastic approximation. Comment: 34 pages; corrected minor typo...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{tourism is}} a widely used term that has {{accumulated}} considerable attention from researchers and policy makers {{over the past two}} decades. However, there is still an apparently wide gap between theory and practice in the area. Recent scholarly research has tended to focus on niche areas of alternative tourism rather than address the broader issues and vagaries and paradoxes that appear to plague the broader notion of sustainable tourism. As such, {{there is a need for}} a new and pragmatic analysis of sustainable tourism as an overarching idea and how this manifests in practice. The Business of Sustainable Tourism fulfils this need by offering a fresh perspective on sustainable tourism as an umbrella concept with inherent tensions. It presents a way of thinking about tourism based on the notion of finding common ground using the dialectic tradition of philosophy. Dialectics focusses on resolving opposing viewpoints by recognising they have common elements that can be combined into a rational and practical solution over time. As part of this approach, the book examines the strongly apparent tensions within alternative tourism as well as the paradox of continuing growth and other mass tourism related issues. It is divided into three parts, Part I includes chapters discussing the general concept of sustainable tourism, its history, current status and possible futures; Part II includes a range of destination case studies exploring how sustainable tourism has been applied and Part III includes perspectives from the tourism <b>operator</b> <b>view.</b> Given the international content and challenging themes, the book will be appealing internationally to students, researchers and academics in the fields of tourism, geography, sustainability and social science...|$|E
