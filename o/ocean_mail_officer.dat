Other railways slowly replaced their 'singles' with 4-4-0 locomotives that offered better traction {{at the cost of}} ultimate speed.

One 115 class, No. 673, survives at the National Railway Museum, York. Other railways adopted the steam-powered sander, leading to a resurgence of interest in the 'single' for fast express passenger work in the 1880s and 1890s. William Dean of the Great Western built fifty examples of the standard gauge GWR 3031 Class Achilles class from 1893-1899.
