40|$|The sediments of a core of. 1. 55 {{m length}} {{taken on the}} {{windward}} side of the Cross Bank, Florida Bay, are clearly subdivided into two portions, as shown by grain size analysis: silt-sized particles predominate in the relatively homogeneous lower {{two thirds of the}} core. This is succeeded abruptly by a thin layer of sand, containing fragments of Halimeda. They indicate a catastrophic event in the Florida Bay region, because Halimeda does not grow within Florida Bay. Above this layer, the amount of sand decreases at first and then continuously increases right to the present sediment-water-interface. The median and skewness increase simultaneously with the increase in the sand and granule portion. We assume that the changing grain size distribution was determined chiefly by the density of the marine flora: during the deposition of the lower two thirds of the core a dense grass cover acted as a sediment catcher for the fine-grained detritus washed out of the shallow basins of the Florida Bay, and simultaneously prohibited renewed reworking. Similar processes go on today on the surface of most mud banks of Florida Bay. The catastrophic event indicated by the sand layer probably changed the morphology of the bank {{to such an extent that}} the sampling point was shifted more to the windward side of the bank. This side is characterized by less dense plant growth. Therefore, less detritus could be caught and the material deposited could be reworked. The pronounced increase in skewness in the upper third of the core certainly indicates a strong washing out of the smaller-sized particles. The sediments are predominantly made up of carbonates, averagely 88. 14 percent. The average CaCO 3 -content is 83. 87 percent and the average MgCO 3 -content amounts to 4. 27 percent. The chief carbonate mineral is aragonite making up 60. 1 percent of the carbonate portion in the average, followed by high-magnesian calcite (33. 8 percent) and calcite (6. 1 percent). With increasing grain size the aragonite clearly increases at the cost of high-magnesian calcite in the upper third of the core. Chemically, this is shown by an increase of the CaCO 3 : MgCO 3 -ratio. This increase is mainly caused by the more common occurrence of aragonitic fragments of mollusks in the coarse grain fractions. The bulk of the carbonates is made up of mollusks, foraminifera, ostracods, and - to a much lesser extent - of corals, worm-tubes, coccolithophorids, and calcareous algae, as shown by microscopic investigations. The total amount of the carbonate in the sediments is biogenic detritus with the possible exception of a very small amount of aragonite needles in the clay and fine silt fraction. The individual carbonate components of the gravel and sand fraction can be relatively easy identified as members of a particular animal or plant group. This becomes very difficult in the silt and clay fraction. Brownish aggregates are very common in the coarse and medium silt fraction. It was not always possible to clarify their origin (biogenic detritus, faecal pellets or carbonate particles cemented by carbonates or <b>organic</b> <b>slime,</b> etc.). Organic matter (plant fragments, rootlets), quartz, opal (siliceous sponge needles), and feldspar also occur in the sediments, besides carbonates. The lowermost part of the core has an age of 1365 +/- 90 years, as shown by 14 C analysis...|$|E
30|$|Membrane {{cleaning}} involves physical cleaning, backwashing, chemical cleaning, {{removal of}} <b>organic</b> films, <b>slimes,</b> and biological fouling. It contributes to 5 – 20 % {{of the operating}} cost. Chemical cleaning agents are commercially available and they are included in six categories: alkalis, acids, metal chelating agents, surfactants, oxidation agents, and enzymes. The most effective combination is enzyme–anti-precipitant–dispersant and bactericidal agent with an anionic detergent for cellulose acetate RO membranes. Another noteworthy combination is chelating agent surfactant with alkali for polyamide RO membranes (Matin et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Material balance {{equations}} {{were given}} to describe the adsorption of gold cyanide on activated carbon in either batch or continuous counter-current CIP systems. Kinetic and equilibrium parameters estimated from batch tests were shown to predict the behaviour of a small scale continuous plant accurately. A parametric sensitivity analysis of this model was conducted in order to explain the factors which influence the efficiency of a CIP plant. Insufficient mixing, large diameters of the carbon particles, the presence of competitive adsorbates, high temperature and pH values, insufficient regeneration of the carbon, a deficiency of dissolved oxygen {{and the presence of}} insoluble <b>organics</b> and fine <b>slime</b> particles all act to increase the concentration of gold in the barren solution.

30|$|Biofouling can be {{effectively}} reduced by two different pretreatment techniques that are disinfection and pH adjustment. Chlorination and ozonation are some chemical disinfectants while UV, sand filtration, electrical treatment, and ultrasound technique are physical disinfection agents. The problem with chlorination is that surviving bacteria will utilize sodium metabisulfite for nutrition after dechlorination {{and therefore it}} is not an ideal choice to prevent biofouling. Intermittent or shock dosing chlorination is an excellent alternative to plants which operate without chlorine. Shock dosing is also performed by using sodium bisulphite (NaHSO 3) with kill rates up to 99 % for seawater microflora. Membrane surface modification is the best technique for the prevention of biofouling as it increases membrane hydrophilicity, decreases surface roughness, and may restrict microbial adhesion by electrostatic repulsion. Hybrid organic/inorganic RO membranes are promising in dealing with biofouling since deposited inorganics such as photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO 2), SiO 2, Zeolite A, and silver nanoparticles are excellent in reducing microorganism populations. The last option to handle biofouling once it has already occurred is membrane cleaning which contributes to 5 – 20 % of the operating cost. Membrane cleaning involves physical cleaning, backwashing, chemical cleaning, removal of <b>organic</b> films, <b>slimes,</b> and biological fouling.|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{and iron}} removal from a bauxite ore by Bacillus polymyxa has been demonstrated. Within {{a period of}} 7 days, the above {{organism}} could remove all the calcium and about 45 % of iron from the ore {{in the presence of}} 2 % sucrose in a Bromfield medium. The highest removal of calcium and iron corresponded with the maximum in extracellular polysaccharide production by the organism. Scanning electron microscopy of the biobeneficiated bauxite surfaces indicated tenacious attachment of the bacteria onto the ore particle. Some calcium and iron removal was observed even in the presence of bacterial metabolites such as polysaccharides, <b>organic</b> acids and <b>slime.</b> However, the calcium removal in the absence of microorganism (by metabolites alone) was found to be 50 % of that obtained in its presence. These observations clearly indicate that both a direct mechanism through bacterial attachment to the ore and an indirect mechanism through leaching with metabolites are involved in the biobeneficiation proces...|$|R
