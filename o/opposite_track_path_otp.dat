With <b>Opposite</b> <b>Track</b> <b>Path</b> (<b>OTP),</b> used on DVD-Video, the lower layer starts at the ID and the upper layer starts at the OD, where the other layer ends, they share one lead-in and one lead-out.

5000|$|There are {{two modes}} for dual-layer orientation, {{parallel}} track path (PTP) and <b>opposite</b> <b>track</b> <b>path</b> (<b>OTP).</b> In PTP mode, used for DVD-ROM, both layers start recording at the inside diameter (ID) with the lead-in and {{end at the}} outside diameter (OD) with the lead-out. Sectors are sequenced {{from the beginning of}} the first layer to the end of the first layer, then the beginning of the second layer to the end of the second layer. In OTP mode, the second layer is read from the outside of the disk.|$|E
50|$|A dual-layer DVD or Blu-ray disc with <b>Opposite</b> <b>Track</b> <b>Path</b> {{means that}} layer 0 {{is written in}} a spiral track {{starting}} at {{the inside of the}} disc reading outwards, whereas the layer 1 spiral starts at the outside of the disc reading inwards. Both tracks are written so that the DVD player will rotate the disc in the same direction. Unlike DVD-ROM discs, DVD video discs are mastered such that layer 0 ends at the same diameter as the layer 1 starts. This means that the layer 1 occupies the end of the layer rather than the start. Thus, although the laser still has to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to seek across the disc to find it.|$|R

5000|$|Dual layer DVDs are {{recorded}} using <b>Opposite</b> <b>Track</b> <b>Path</b> (<b>OTP).</b> [...] DVD-ROM discs mastered for computer use are produced with track 0 {{starting at the}} inside diameter (as {{is the case with}} a single layer). Track 1 then starts at the outside diameter. DVD video discs are mastered slightly differently. The video is divided between the layers such that layer 1 can be made to start at the same diameter that layer 0 finishes. This speeds up the transition as the layer changes because although the laser does have to refocus on layer 1, it does not have to skip across the disc to find it.|$|E

Graphs of detected values were designed and analyzed. Results: Our study suggests that the use of Prague cycling <b>tracks</b> and <b>paths</b> is gradually increasing, however, their condition requires further development and construction. To plan investment, there is necessary to possess detailed knowledge of its frequentation that would only be ensured by high quality detecting technology developped by ECO-counter.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in computer science}} and electronics have greatly expanded the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in both defense and civil applications, such as moving ground object tracking. Due to the uncertainties of the application environments and objects’ motion, {{it is difficult to}} maintain the tracked object always within the sensor coverage area by using a single UAV. Hence, it is necessary to deploy a group of UAVs to improve the robustness of the tracking. This paper investigates the problem of tracking ground moving objects with a group of UAVs using gimbaled sensors under flight dynamic and collision-free constraints. The optimal cooperative <b>tracking</b> <b>path</b> planning problem is solved using an evolutionary optimization technique based on the framework of chemical reaction optimization (CRO). The efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated through a series of comparative simulations.

The experiments show that the controlled robot can <b>track</b> the planned <b>path</b> accurately and robustly when it runs at high speed; the process of <b>path</b> <b>tracking</b> is stable and no slipping and rolling occur...|$|R
