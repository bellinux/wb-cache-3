25|$|Resistive <b>opto-isolator</b> (RO), {{also called}} photoresistive <b>opto-isolator,</b> vactrol (after a genericized {{trademark}} introduced by Vactec, Inc. in the 1960s), analog <b>opto-isolator</b> or lamp-coupled photocell, is an optoelectronic device {{consisting of a}} source and detector of light, which are optically coupled and electrically isolated from each other. The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|E
2500|$|In a diode {{formed from}} a direct {{band-gap}} semiconductor, such as gallium arsenide, charge carriers that cross the junction emit photons when they recombine {{with the majority}} carrier on the other side. Depending on the material, wavelengths (or colors) from the infrared to the near ultraviolet may be produced. The forward potential of these diodes depends on the wavelength of the emitted photons: 2.1V corresponds to red, 4.0V to violet. The first LEDs were red and yellow, and higher-frequency diodes have been developed over time. All LEDs produce incoherent, narrow-spectrum light; [...] "white" [...] LEDs are actually combinations of three LEDs of a different color, or a blue LED with a yellow scintillator coating. LEDs {{can also be used}} as low-efficiency photodiodes in signal applications. An LED may be paired with a photodiode or phototransistor in the same package, to form an <b>opto-isolator.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{value of}} {{optically}} coupling a solid state light emitter to a semiconductor detector {{for the purpose}} of electrical isolation was recognized in 1963 by Akmenkalns,et al. (US patent 3,417,249). Photoresistor-based <b>opto-isolators</b> were introduced in 1968. They are the slowest, but also the most linear isolators and still retain a niche market in audio and music industry. Commercialization of LED technology in 1968-1970 caused a boom in optoelectronics, {{and by the end of}} the 1970s the industry developed all principal types of <b>opto-isolators.</b> The majority of <b>opto-isolators</b> on the market use bipolar silicon phototransistor sensors. They attain medium data transfer speed, sufficient for applications like electroencephalography. The fastest <b>opto-isolators</b> use PIN diodes in photoconductive mode.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Opto-isolators</b> can be {{too slow}} and bulky for modern digital applications. Since the 1990s, {{researchers}} have examined and perfected alternative, faster and more compact isolation technologies. Two of these technologies, transformer based isolators and capacitor-coupled isolators, reached the mass market in the 2000s. The third alternative, based on giant magnetoresistance, has been present on the market since 2002 in limited quantities. As of 2010, production models of all three types allow data transfer speeds of 150 Mbit/s and resist voltage transients of up to 25 kV/μs, compared to 10 kV/μs for <b>opto-isolators.</b> Unlike <b>opto-isolators,</b> which are stacks of discrete LEDs and sensors, the new devices are monolithic integrated circuits, and are easily scalable into multi-bit data bus isolators.|$|R

50|$|Photodiode <b>opto-isolators</b> can be {{used for}} {{interfacing}} analog signals, although their non-linearity invariably distorts the signal. A special class of analog <b>opto-isolators</b> introduced by Burr-Brown uses two photodiodes and an input-side operational amplifier to compensate for diode non-linearity. One of two identical diodes is wired into the feedback loop of the amplifier, which maintains overall current transfer ratio at a constant level regardless of the non-linearity in the second (output) diode.|$|R

50|$|The fastest <b>opto-isolators</b> employ PIN diodes in {{photoconductive}} mode. The {{response times}} of PIN diodes {{lie in the}} subnanosecond range; overall system speed is limited by delays in LED output and in biasing circuitry. To minimize these delays, fast digital <b>opto-isolators</b> contain their own LED drivers and output amplifiers optimized for speed. These devices are called full logic opto-isolators: their LEDs and sensors are fully encapsulated within a digital logic circuit. The Hewlett-Packard 6N137/HPCL2601 family of devices equipped with internal output amplifiers {{was introduced in the}} late 1970s and attained 10 MBd data transfer speeds. It remained an industry standard until the introduction of the 50 MBd Agilent Technologies 7723/0723 family in 2002. The 7723/0723 series <b>opto-isolators</b> contain CMOS LED drivers and a CMOS buffered amplifiers, which require two independent external power supplies of 5 V each.|$|R

50|$|<b>Opto-isolators</b> keep MIDI devices {{electrically}} {{separated from}} their connectors, which prevents the occurrence of ground loops and protects equipment from voltage spikes. There is no error detection capability in MIDI, so the maximum cable length is set at 15 meters (50 feet) in order to limit interference.|$|R
50|$|Photoresistors used in <b>opto-isolators</b> rely on bulk {{effects in}} a uniform film of semiconductor; there are no p-n junctions. Uniquely among photosensors, photoresistors are {{non-polar}} devices suited for either AC or DC circuits. Their resistance drops in reverse proportion to the intensity of incoming light, from virtually infinity to a residual floor that may be as low as {{less than a hundred}} Ohms. These properties made the original Vactrol a convenient and cheap automatic gain control and compressor for telephone networks. The photoresistors easily withstood voltages up to 400 volts, which made them ideal for driving vacuum fluorescent displays. Other industrial applications included photocopiers, industrial automation, professional light measurement instruments and auto-exposure meters. Most of these applications are now obsolete, but resistive <b>opto-isolators</b> retained a niche in audio, in particular guitar amplifier, markets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Opto-isolators</b> using field-effect {{transistors}} (FETs) as sensors {{are rare}} and, like vactrols, {{can be used}} as remote-controlled analog potentiometers provided that the voltage across the FET's output terminal does not exceed a few hundred mV. Opto-FETs turn on without injecting switching charge in the output circuit, which is particularly useful in sample and hold circuits.|$|R
50|$|All opto-isolators {{described}} {{so far are}} uni-directional. Optical channel always works one way, {{from the}} source (LED) to the sensor. The sensors, be it photoresistors, photodiodes or phototransistors, cannot emit light. But LEDs, like all semiconductor diodes, are capable of detecting incoming light, which makes possible construction of a two-way <b>opto-isolator</b> {{from a pair of}} LEDs. The simplest bidirectional <b>opto-isolator</b> is merely a pair of LEDs placed face to face and held together with heat-shrink tubing. If necessary, the gap between two LEDs can be extended with a glass fiber insert.|$|E
5000|$|Speed sensing devices, termed {{variously}} [...] "wheel impulse generators" [...] (WIG), speed probes, or tachometers {{are used}} extensively in rail vehicles. Common types include <b>opto-isolator</b> slotted disk sensors and Hall effect sensors.|$|E
50|$|The {{developmental}} {{trends of}} interface relay technology suggest {{the use of}} <b>opto-isolator</b> as the prevailing design principle of interface relays. An <b>opto-isolator</b> can be implemented {{in terms of an}} LED and a phototransistor (or photothyristor or a photodiode) or a lamp and a photoresistor. An example of an opto-electronic interface relay is shown in the figure. The transparent high voltage insulating barrier provides galvanic isolation of the circuits under the difference of potentials up to 5-7 kV. For higher voltages, they use an optical fiber, the length of which (depending on the voltage level) can take from dozens of centimeters to several meters.|$|E
50|$|Devices {{containing}} {{sensitive components}} {{must be protected}} during normal use, installation, and disconnection, accomplished by designed-in protection at external connections where needed. Protection may be {{through the use of}} more robust devices or protective countermeasures at the device's external interfaces. These may be <b>opto-isolators,</b> less sensitive types of transistors, and static bypass devices such as metal oxide varistors.|$|R
50|$|Visible {{spectrum}} LEDs {{have relatively}} poor transfer efficiency, thus near infrared spectrum GaAs, GaAs:Si and AlGaAs:Si LEDs are the preferred choice for bidirectional devices. Bidirectional <b>opto-isolators</b> built around pairs of GaAs:Si LEDs have current transfer ratio of around 0.06% in either photovoltaic or photoconductive mode — less than photodiode-based isolators, but sufficiently practical for real-world applications.|$|R
50|$|Magnetoresistive {{insulators}} for contactless {{signal transmission}} between two electrically isolated parts of electrical circuits were first demonstrated in 1997 {{as an alternative}} to <b>opto-isolators.</b> A Wheatstone bridge of four identical GMR devices is insensitive to a uniform magnetic field and reacts only when the field directions are antiparallel in the neighboring arms of the bridge. Such devices were reported in 2003 and may be used as rectifiers with a linear frequency response.|$|R
5000|$|Only {{one end of}} {{the loop}} is {{referenced}} to ground, with the other end [...] "floating", to prevent ground loops which may otherwise cause interference and hum in analog audio signals. The current loop on the transmitter side drives the LED of an <b>opto-isolator</b> on the receiver side. The current loop is specified as 5 mA. The <b>opto-isolator</b> must be a high-speed type, with less than 2 μs risetime. As most opto-isolators have asymmetrical positive-going and negative-going slew rates, they slightly alter the signal's duty cycle. If several MIDI devices are connected in series by daisy-chaining the MIDI THRU to the next device's MIDI-IN, the signal gets more and more distorted, until receive errors occur due to pulse narrowing.|$|E
50|$|A {{common type}} of <b>opto-isolator</b> {{consists}} of an LED and a phototransistor in the same opaque package. Other types of source-sensor combinations include LED-photodiode, LED-LASCR, and lamp-photoresistor pairs. Usually opto-isolators transfer digital (on-off) signals, but some techniques {{allow them to be}} used with analog signals.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of an <b>opto-isolator</b> is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, {{so that a}} surge {{in one part of}} the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts. Historically, this function was delegated to isolation transformers, which use inductive coupling between galvanically isolated input and output sides. Transformers and opto-isolators are the only two classes of electronic devices that offer reinforced protection — they protect both the equipment and the human user operating this equipment. They contain a single physical isolation barrier, but provide protection equivalent to double isolation. Safety, testing and approval of opto-couplers are regulated by national and international standards: IEC 60747-5-2, EN (CENELEC) 60747-5-2, UL 1577, CSA Component Acceptance Notice #5, etc. <b>Opto-isolator</b> specifications published by manufacturers always follow at least one of these regulatory frameworks.|$|E
5000|$|Buchla's instruments, {{such as the}} Music Easel (pictured), use a {{different}} method of timbre generation than Moog synthesizers. Moog units use oscillators with basic function generator type waveshapes and rely heavily on filtering with 24 dB resonant low-pass filters, while Buchlas are geared toward complex oscillators using frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, and dynamic waveshaping to produce other forms of timbre modulation. Many of Don Buchla's designs, including the Low-Pass Gates (later called Dynamic Managers) contain vactrols (photoresistive <b>opto-isolators</b> used as voltage-controlled potentiometers) that contributed to a very [...] "natural" [...] perception of Buchla sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>opto-isolators,</b> originally {{marketed as}} light cells, {{emerged in the}} 1960s. They employed miniature incandescent light bulbs as sources of light, and cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium selenide (CdSe) photoresistors (also called light-dependent resistors, LDRs) as receivers. In applications where control linearity was not important, or where available current was too low for driving an incandescent bulb (as {{was the case in}} vacuum tube amplifiers), it was replaced with a neon lamp. These devices (or just their LDR component) were commonly named Vactrols, after a trademark of Vactec, Inc. The trademark has since been genericized, but the original Vactrols are still being manufactured by PerkinElmer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Opto-isolators</b> {{rated for}} 2.5 to 6 kV employ a {{different}} layout called silicone dome. Here, the LED and sensor dies {{are placed on}} the {{opposite sides of the}} package; the LED fires into the sensor horizontally. The LED, the sensor and the gap between them are encapsulated in a blob, or dome, of transparent silicone. The dome acts as a reflector, retaining all stray light and reflecting it onto the surface of the sensor, minimizing losses in a relatively long optical channel. In double mold designs the space between the silicone blob ("inner mold") and the outer shell ("outer mold") is filled with dark dielectric compound with a matched coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|R
