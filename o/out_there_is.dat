5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E

Here they are batched into rows and board their ride cars, while various technical graphics are displayed on overhead screens. As the cars dispatch, the screens play an automated video featuring the Lord of Darkness {{in his final}} appearance as he recites the following monologue:For some things, there is no rational explanation. There is no way <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no happy ending to the story. Welcome to the unknown; welcome to eternal darkness; welcome...to Oblivion.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} staff {{estimate that}} the peak ridership of the one-stop extension to be 7,300 in the peak hour and peak direction, {{about half of the}} 15,000 peak ridership considered the low end to justify a subway. With the original three-stop extension, the peak ridership estimate was 9,500 to 14,000; however, that estimate was reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7,300 would still be acceptable as it is still greater than the 6,000 peak at terminal station Kipling. However, a Toronto Star article points <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership. The SSE would carry an estimate 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE performs better in ridership only against the terminal of the underperforming Line 4 Sheppard line.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E

25|$|The federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit (income {{tax credit}} on IRS Form 5695) for {{residential}} PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 {{to remain at}} 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service {{by the end of}} 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but not to a property that is rented <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the Alternative Minimum Tax, and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.|$|E
25|$|Hume {{also points}} <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> still a {{possibility}} that the universe could have been created by random chance but still show evidence of design as the universe is eternal and would have an infinite {{amount of time to}} be able to form a universe so complex and ordered as our own. He called that the 'Epicurean hypothesis'. It argued that when the universe was first created, the universe was random and chaotic, but if the universe is eternal, over an unlimited period of time, natural forces could have naturally 'evolved' by random particles coming together over time into the incredibly ordered system we can observe today without the need of an intelligent designer as an explanation.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation might benefit future generations {{at the expense of}} current generations, but {{there is no way that}} future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations. If, for example, some countries were to benefit from future climate change but others lose <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers; similarly, if some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others lose out, there would likewise be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers.|$|E

25|$|To {{gain access}} to the Press Photo Archives in Buea one is {{required}} to write an application to the corresponding authorities. There are no hard copies of photographic prints as the archives contain only negatives and proof sheets. There is no equipment to print the negatives. It is also difficult to access the material that was digitised by African Photography Initiatives with support from the British Library’s Endangered Archives Program and the Swiss Federal Office of Culture. With the support of a team six Cameroonians and in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication between 2013 and 2015, over 25,000 negatives and 14,000 proof sheets were digitised, a database established and conservation measures carried <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a pending offer of the British Library to make the digitised material available on their website but permission by the Ministry of Communication had not been granted by early 2017.

25|$|Oceans, seas, {{lakes and}} other bodies of liquids can be {{composed}} of liquids other than water, for example the hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. The possibility of seas of nitrogen on Triton was also considered but ruled <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> evidence that the icy surfaces of the moons Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan and Enceladus are shells floating on oceans of very dense liquid water or water–ammonia. Earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70% covered in water. Extrasolar terrestrial planets that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked and so {{one half of the}} planet will be a magma ocean. It is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts. Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface. Where there are suitable temperatures and pressures, volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include ammonia, argon, carbon disulfide, ethane, hydrazine, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, neon, nitrogen, nitric oxide, phosphine, silane, sulfuric acid, and water.|$|E
25|$|The king, Shalmaneser III, {{stands before}} four divine emblems: (1) the winged disk, {{the symbol of}} the god Ashur, or, as some hold, of Shamash; (2) the six-pointed star of Ishtar, goddess of the morning and evening star; (3) the crown of the sky-god Anu, in this {{instance}} with three horns, in profile; (4) the disk and crescent of the god Sin as the new and the full moon. On his collar the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. The gesture of the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the fingers with the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems fairly clear that the gesture is described in the phrase 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the reverse action, in which the index finger is not stretched <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a cuneiform inscription written across the face and base and around the sides of the stela.|$|E

500|$|The vast moral {{chasm between}} Erictho and the Sibyl is nicely brought out by Lucan's {{account of their}} {{respective}} preparations. While the Sibyl piously insists that the unburied corpse of Misenus (exanimum corpus, Aen. 6.149) must be properly buried before Aeneas embarks on his underworld journey, Erictho specifically requires an unburied corpse (described similarly as exanimes artus, 720) for her undertaking. As [...] Masters points <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a clear connection between Erictho's cadaver and Virgil's Misenus. This facilitates one further inversion: whereas the Sibyl's rites begin within a burial, Erictho's conclude with a burial.|$|E
