25|$|A {{cataract}} is a clouding of {{the lens}} in the eye {{which leads to a}} decrease in vision. Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded colors, blurry vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night. This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces. Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression. Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33% <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> worldwide.|$|E

25|$|In an {{epidemiologic}} study, 56 {{percent of}} patients with Behçet's disease developed ocular involvement at {{a mean age of}} 30. Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Behçet's disease in 8.6 {{percent of patients}}. Ocular Behçet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Behçet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%), retinal hemorrhage (9%), macular edema (11.3%), branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%), and retinal edema (6.6%). However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> identified in 54 percent of patients with ocular Behçet's disease and permanent visual impairment.|$|E

Other sports, like athletics, are open to athletes {{with a wide variety}} of impairments. In athletics, participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment. [...] For example: classes 11–13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Optic nerve {{involvement}} in Behçet's disease is rare, typically presenting as progressive [...] optic atrophy and visual loss.

40|$|PurposeThis review {{presents}} {{the evidence on}} the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and the similar behavioural traits associated with both <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and autism.

Eleven studies identified behavioural traits common to both autistic and visually impaired populations. The majority were small-scale screening studies using varied methodologies, constituting an emerging field of research. ConclusionFurther large-scale, multicentre studies are required to accurately identify prevalence rates of ophthalmic conditions in people with ASD.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> among children in primary schools. Methodology: This cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} between from November 1 st to December 31 st 2006. Visual acuity was determined with the Snellen’s E chart. <b>Visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was defined as <b>visual</b> acuity <b>of</b> d” 20 / 40 in the better eye, as amblyopia if the difference in visual acuity between both eyes was 0. 2 d”dioptry, and as strabismus if the cover test was positive. Results: Of the study group (n= 1606), 53. 7 % (n= 864) were boys and 46. 3 % (n= 742) girls. The {{mean age of the}} participants was 10. 52 ± 2. 28 (range 6 - 17), The girls had a higher frequency <b>of</b> a presenting <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> than boys (2. 4 % vs. 1. 0 %), (p< 0. 05). Twenty seven (1. 7 %) children presented with vision of d” 20 / 40 in the better eye. The prevalence <b>of</b> presenting <b>visual</b> acuity for d” 20 / 40 was significantly higher in children with glasses compared to the group of children without glasses (p< 0. 05). The prevalence of amblyopia was 5. 0 %, whereas that of strabismus was 1. 7 %.

However, most teachers have not been instructed how to teach students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in a mainstream classroom.
