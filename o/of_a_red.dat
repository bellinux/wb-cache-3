5|$|Cartman {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire which consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered {{with a yellow}} pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) dreams <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> {{light that}} {{leads him to}} the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E

Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E

By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from <b>a</b> deck <b>of</b> cards, the event <b>of</b> drawing <b>a</b> <b>red</b> card on the first trial and that <b>of</b> drawing <b>a</b> <b>red</b> card on the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had <b>a</b> <b>red</b> card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R

5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition {{has since been}} changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard {{for the length of}} a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

5|$|The Flag of Bangladesh has a {{green field}} {{based on a}} similar flag used during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> disc {{on top of a}} green field. The red disc represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius of the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Constitutional Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, a white field {{charged with}} the coats of arms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Two Sicilies, and Granada, was {{modified}} by Ferdinand II through the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> and green border. This flag lasted from 3 April 1848 until 19 May 1849. The Provisional Government of Sicily, which lasted from 12 January 1848 to 15 May 1849, adopted the Italian tricolour, defaced with the trinacria, or triskelion.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} emblem {{that was used}} {{at the time of}} the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> shield, an armored white knight is mounted on a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> flag does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E

5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> brick retort, built in 1924, {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, PD {{affected}} 6.2 {{million people}} and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people {{over the age of}} 60, of which about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than females. When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called young-onset PD. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years. The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson, who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, in 1817. Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson's Day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April) and the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> tulip as the symbol of the disease. People with parkinsonism who have increased the public's awareness of the condition include actor Michael J. Fox, Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney, and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are a contrast to her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E

5|$|Located in {{the west}} of the {{constellation}} and depicting the peacock's tail are Eta and Xi Pavonis. At apparent magnitude 3.6, Eta is a luminous orange giant of spectral type K2II some 350 light years distant from Earth. Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as a brighter orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 light years from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. AR Pavonis is a faint but well-studied eclipsing binary composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from Earth. It has some features of a cataclysmic variable, the smaller component most likely having an accretion disc. The visual magnitude ranges from 7.4 to 13.6 over 605 days.|$|E
5|$|Lying a {{few degrees}} west of Beta is Delta Pavonis, a nearby Sun-like but more evolved star; this is a yellow subgiant of {{spectral}} type G8IV and apparent magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 light years distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation's eastern border with Indus is Gamma Pavonis, a fainter, solar-type star 30 light years from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: SCR 1845-6357 (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> dwarf and brown dwarf companion lying around 12.6 light years distant, while Gliese 693 is a red dwarf of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 light years away.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Roeg had {{employed}} the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, {{but it was}} originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can {{be traced back to}} earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love.|$|E
