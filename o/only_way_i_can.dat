6000|$|From the {{expedition}} from the Department of West Virginia I do [...] not calculate on very great results; {{but it is}} the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> [...] <b>can</b> take troops from there.

6000|$|This is {{the point}} that has perplexed me, for Knox, {{no less than the}} Congregation, seems to have {{deliberately}} said good-bye to truth and honour, unless the Lords elaborately deceived their secretary and diplomatic agent.

"When I {{can tell}} how the ore should pan {{out by a}} glance at the dump, and plot just how the vein should run, it's disconcerting to find that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> earn a living is by washing and mending," [...] he said.

6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. I don’t {{know that}} women are always rewarded for being charming. I think they are usually punished for it!

60|$|In fact, I was {{surprised}} at the mildness of his statements. I could not have made such statements if I had preferred to, because to exaggerate is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> approximate to the truth.

60|$|To deal truly, {{this is the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> discover, {{whereby the}} IDEAS OF THINGS are brought into the understanding.
