5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E
5|$|ML {{contracted}} Cammell Laird of Birkenhead {{to build}} two smaller vessels of 1,800 tons. Commissioned in 1952, they were named the Manchester Pioneer and Explorer. They {{were joined by}} the secondhand 1,400-ton Manchester Prospector. The trio were the first <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> able {{to pass through the}} restricted-size canals and locks leading directly to Toronto and the other Great Lakes ports as far as Detroit, Michigan. This initiative, the first by a British line, and taken well ahead of the 1959 completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, gave the line a head start in the direct trade to the Midwest ports. During the winter months, when thick ice prevented navigation on the lakes, the trio were employed elsewhere, sometimes on charter to other lines.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Ticonderoga cannons, {{which were}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> and range not {{previously}} {{available to the}} Americans, were emplaced in fortifications around the city, and {{on the night of}} March 2, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.|$|E

We compare the number of halting Turing machines <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>size</b> to the number of provable theorems of first-order logic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>size,</b> and the runtime of the longest-running Turing machine <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>size</b> to the proof length of the most-difficult-to-prove theorem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>size.</b> It is suggested that theorem provers are subject to the same non-linear tradeoff between time and size as computer programs are, affording the possibility of determining optimal timeouts and waiting times in automatic theorem proving. I provide the statistics for some small choices of parameters for both of these systems...|$|R

50|$|A {{wrap reel}} or skein winder is a device for {{measuring}} yarn {{and making it}} into hanks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>size..</b> The reel is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>size</b> and its revolutions are counted as the yarn is wrapped around it. Typically, <b>a</b> set number <b>of</b> revolutions will be used so that the hank is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>size</b> — <b>a</b> skein or lea. For example, <b>a</b> skein <b>of</b> cotton would be 80 turns on <b>a</b> reel <b>of</b> 54 inches circumference, making 120 yards, while the standard length for wool worsted would be 80 yards.|$|R
5|$|Woodlea's {{exterior}} {{was designed}} in an Italian Renaissance Revival style. The house {{is said to}} have been modeled after Kimberley Hall in Kimberley, Norfolk. Its classical devices of 18th-century English architecture include urns, pediments, columns, and balusters. The house also is a full-blown expression of the American Renaissance. Woodlea incorporates characteristics of the Beaux-Arts style of architecture– the exterior dictates the use of the interior, with family and guest rooms on the third floor. At the north end of the house, situated farthest from the main entrance, and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> larger than most houses, is the service wing, which contains the servant quarters. Compared to the rest of the house, this wing has lower ceilings, smaller windows, and less exterior trim. In the early 1900s, the wing was clad in ivy.|$|E

25|$|Gaspra's surface lacks {{unambiguous}} craters <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> {{comparable to}} its radius, like those seen for example on 253 Mathilde. A probable {{reason is that}} the collision that produced the Flora family and Gaspra was relatively recent on an astronomical timescale, so that Gaspra has not yet had the opportunity to acquire many large craters since. Analysis of cratering rates suggests the age of the surface is between about 20 to 300 million years.|$|E
25|$|It is {{produced}} in both hardcover and softcover versions. Since 2006, a larger format edition has been published on an experimental basis. This {{is said to be}} in response to requests from readers who find the print size of the standard edition hard to read. It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited edition of 5,000. It is not a large print book as such, as the print will still be <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> found in many standard books.|$|E
25|$|Vog (volcanic fog) can envelop the island. The gas {{plumes of}} the Kīlauea Volcano create {{a blanket of}} vog which the {{dominant}} trade winds mostly deflect toward the Kona coast {{on the west side}} of the island of Hawaiʻi. Vog contains chemicals that can damage the environment and the health of plants, humans, and other animals. Most of the aerosols are acidic and <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> where they can remain in the lungs to damage them and impair function. Flu-like symptoms and general lethargy are reported, especially pronounced in people with respiratory conditions.|$|E

25|$|Another {{technique}} for overcoming the memory-size problem is using external sorting, for example {{one of the}} ways is to combine two algorithms in a way that takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> that will fit in RAM, the contents of each chunk sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as quicksort), and the results merged using a k-way merge similar to that used in mergesort. This is faster than performing either mergesort or quicksort over the entire list.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{implements}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> considered {{appropriate to}} the 3-foot-tall human are also widely present in the cave. The implements are at horizons initially dated at from 95,000 to 13,000 years ago and are associated with (found in the same stratigraphic layer as) an elephant of the extinct genus Stegodon (which was widespread throughout Asia during the Quaternary), presumably the prey of LB1. Homo sapiens reached the region by around 50,000 years ago. Comparisons of the stone artefacts with those made by modern humans in East Timor indicate many technological similarities.|$|E
25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy beam of electrons, and have to be <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> that will fit on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E

25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri {{seems to}} have survived in local refugia the {{reduction}} of the favourable steppe-like habitat due to climatic extremes during the pleniglacial and interstadial periods, as it is the case today. Pfenninger & Bahl (1997) suggested that snail species with restricted dispersal might survive in habitats <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> in the magnitude of few square meters. There is increasing evidence that such small spots with a favourable microclimate existed in the periglacial area of central Europe and were presumed to have provided refuges for comparatively cold resistant snail species. Southern and eastern European refugia were also supplemented by cryptic sanctuaries in northern Europe during the late Pleistocene in shaping present day species composition.|$|E
25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders {{to have to find}} their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|E

25|$|Newer John Lewis at home {{stores are}} opening to cater for areas which have no large John Lewis {{department}} store near them. They are around a third <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> {{of a normal}} department store. The first store opened in Poole in October 2009. Croydon followed in August 2010 with Tunbridge Wells and Swindon opening later that year. In Autumn 2011, Tamworth and Chester were opened, followed by Chichester, Newbury and Ipswich in 2012. This type of store contains both Home and Electrical departments with services such as a cafe and 'Click and Collect' also available. A new 'flexible format' store was trialled in Exeter 2012, with full line of stock in a smaller physical store, relying heavily on 'click and collect'/next day delivery both in store and out.|$|E
25|$|Much as {{counties}} were subdivided as {{the population}} grew to maintain a government <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> and location both convenient and of citizens with common interests (at least to some degree), as Virginia grew, the portions that remained after the subdivision of Kentucky in 1776 became more populated. For the western areas, problems were {{the distance from the}} state seat of government in Richmond and the difference of common economic interests resultant from the tobacco and food crops farming, fishing, and coastal shipping on the Eastern Continental Divide (waters that drain to the Atlantic Ocean) along the Allegheny Mountains, and the interests of the western portion, which drained to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. The western area focused its commerce on neighbors to the west, and many citizens felt that the more populous eastern areas were too dominant in the State Legislature and insensitive to their needs. Major crises in the Virginia state government were averted during the period before the American Civil War, but the underlying problems were fundamental and never well-resolved.|$|E
