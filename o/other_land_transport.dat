An ongoing programme is in place to restore and conserve items in the collections. This work is largely managed by volunteers {{many of whom have}} been associated with MOTAT for upwards of four decades. Since the passing of the Museum of Transport and Technology Act in 2000, new management and the support of full-time professional museum staff and a large number of dedicated long term volunteers have ensured the Museum's future.

40|$|A {{number of}} methods are being {{undertaken}} in New Zealand to achieve sustainable <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> outcomes. Lower urban speeds (less than 50 km/h) {{are increasingly being}} used to improve safety, but may also contribute to <b>other</b> sustainable <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> outcomes. This research includes: a literature review, case studies, a survey of industry professionals and comparative analysis, to consider the potential effectiveness and efficiency of reducing urban speeds 1 to achieve sustainable <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> outcomes. There is reasonable consistency between {{the findings of the}} survey, case studies and literature review. The key areas of difference relate to the survey responses potentially under-estimating political and public support for reducing speeds. The responses also over-estimate the current contribution of industry knowledge, and the adverse effects of travel times, vehicle emissions, and fuel usage. In respect to efficiency, reducing urban speeds can be successfully implemented in New Zealand, time and cost requirements are achievable, and legislation is permissive, but additional guidance and industry knowledge is required. Political and public opinions are difficult to determine but there is nothing to suggest that there is widespread opposition to reducing urban speeds, particularly in residential, high pedestrian and business areas. In respect to effectiveness, reducing urban speeds can contribute to improving: safety, public health, accessibility, integrated urban form, environmental sustainability 2 and economic development. The impact of increased travel times on functional transport networks is likely to result in some adverse effects, but these {{are not likely to be}} significant. Compared to the provision of walking and cycling infrastructure, from the information available, reducing urban speeds is considered to be at least as effective at achieving sustainable <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> outcomes. Reducing urban speeds could also be as efficient, as provision of walking and cycling infrastructure, with more consistent political support, more guidance on the use of legislation, and once the level of industry knowledge improves...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{barriers}} to integration of <b>land</b> use and <b>transport</b> planning {{is the lack of}} a "common language" (i. e. tools, instruments, indicators) that can support planners from both domains in developing shared visions and integrated strategies. Many of such tools and indicators have been developed in recent years, but not so many are implemented in practice. In this paper a new, participatory development approach for planning support systems (PSS) is proposed, termed "mediated planning support" (MPS) that addresses bottlenecks blocking this implementation. It is founded on insights from knowledge management, system dynamics and software innovation and is applied in the Greater Region of Amsterdam. This paper discusses the evolution of the PSS, highlighting the most useful elements which can be applied in <b>other</b> <b>land</b> use and <b>transport</b> planning projects. It offers insights for practitioners and researchers interested in <b>land</b> use and <b>transport</b> planning integration and for professionals that are dealing with supporting planning with information and technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{study was}} done {{to find out the}} types of injuries, modes of road traffic {{accidents}} and case fatality rate of road traffic accident cases from 1 st April 2005 to 31 st March 2010 in a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: The retrospective study conducted on hospitalized patients admitted with road traffic accidents in a tertiary care level from 1 st April 2005 to 31 st March 2010. Data collected from the registers maintained in the medical records department, follows the guidelines of International Classification of Diseases- 10 coding. Results: Of the 7, 660 road traffic accident cases reported in a hospital from 1 st April 2005 to 31 st March 2010. Most of the cases and deaths were occurred in the age group of 15 - 44 years. Total deaths occurred due to road traffic accident was 249 (3. 25 %). Motorcycle rider injured in road traffic accident was more except <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> accidents during the period from 2005 to 2010. Of the road traffic accident cases, fractures (42. 7 %) were more than superficial injuries (18. 56 %) and dislocations (2. 6 %). Conclusion: This study mentioned that most of the cases and deaths were occurred in 15 - 44 years. Accidents of the economically productive people will affect their family.

40|$|Inland {{waterway}} transport (IWT) in Ukraine {{is currently in}} its infancy stage in comparison with <b>other</b> <b>land</b> based <b>transport</b> modes (rail and road) and with other countries that possess navigable rivers. This paper {{is an extension of}} the research initiated by Grushevska and Notteboom (2015, 2016) where the concepts of intermediacy and centrality are introduced in order to assess the role of Ukraine in the global and regional transport networks. The list of key obstacles for Ukraine’s intermediacy function includes such IWT related barriers as: (i) deficient inland waterway infrastructure, (ii) high IWT costs (fees for bridges, locks etc.) and (iii) pilotage charges. To date the transportation to/from ports is mainly fulfilled by road or by rail-based multimodal transport solutions. We have analysed the unutilized potential of Ukrainian IWT that needs to be efficiently exploited {{for the benefit of the}} national economy and national transport system. This study intends to enrich the limited academic research on IWT systems in a transition stage, as exemplified by the case of Ukraine...|$|R
40|$|Using the EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) global climate-chemistry model {{coupled to}} the aerosol module MADE (Modal Aerosol Dynamics model for Europe, adapted for global applications), we {{simulate}} {{the impact of}} <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> and shipping emissions on global atmospheric aerosol and climate in 2030. Future emissions of short-lived gas and aerosol species follow the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) designed {{in support of the}} Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We compare the resulting 2030 land-transport- and shipping-induced aerosol concentrations to the ones obtained for the year 2000 in a previous study with the same model configuration. The simulations suggest that black carbon and aerosol nitrate are the most relevant pollutants from <b>land</b> <b>transport</b> in 2000 and 2030 and their impacts are characterized by very strong regional variations during this time period. Europe and North America experience a decrease in the land-transport-induced particle pollution, although in these regions this sector remains a major source of surface-level pollution in 2030 under all RCPs. In Southeast Asia, however, a significant increase is simulated, but in this region the surface-level pollution is still controlled by <b>other</b> sources than <b>land</b> <b>transport.</b> Shipping-induced air pollution is mostly due to aerosol sulfate and nitrate, which show opposite trends towards 2030. Sulfate is strongly reduced as a consequence of sulfur reduction policies in ship fuels in force since 2010, while nitrate tends to increase due to the excess of ammonia following the reduction in ammonium sulfate. The aerosol-induced climate impact of both sectors is dominated by aerosol-cloud effects and is projected to decrease between 2000 and 2030, nevertheless still contributing a significant radiative forcing to Earth's radiation budget...|$|R
