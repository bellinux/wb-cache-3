5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon <b>observation</b> <b>coach,</b> which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E
5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an <b>observation</b> <b>coach.</b> The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} argued {{that one of}} the {{important}} aspects of action research is its´ emancipatory aim. However students are rarely directly involved in teachers´ professional development. This paper explores how students can be involved in teacher development based on action research theories. The study involved four Upper Secondary teachers, teaching students aged 16 to 18, who worked in a school development project throughout a school year. Their aim was to improve a certain aspect of their teaching based on suggestions put forward by the students. The teachers used various methods for continuous reflection on their progress, such as <b>observation,</b> <b>coaching</b> and individual written reflection. Students were also invited to assess their teachers´ professional development. The teachers themselves found that this was a feasible way of improving their teaching skills. The majority of students believed their teachers developed professionally. Several teachers and students also reported that relations between students and teachers improved during the time of this study. The paper ends by offering a re-modelling of the model put forward in 2013 by Helen Timperley for school development, by adding a starting point where students are asked to define what they need from their teachers to better succeed in their studies...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of a {{training}} program focusing on the deliberate use of interventions during coaching dialogues with prospective teachers was investigated. Video recordings were analyzed of coaching dialogues carried on in the workplace by 28 teachers in primary education with the prospective teachers under their guidance, both before and after they participated in the training program. The main goal of this program was to broaden the repertoire of interventions which coaches use in their dialogues with student teachers. The video recordings made were transcribed verbatim, coded by three independent researchers and analyzed using descriptive statistics and t tests for paired <b>observations.</b> <b>Coaches</b> repertoires of interventions were found to consist of an average of six types of interventions. This average remained stable throughout the training program. After training, a shift from directive towards non-directive interventions was observed. The length of the coaches speaking time decreased, while the number of their interventions increased. After training, coaches structured dialogues to a greater extent. Considerable interindividual variability existed between coaches. The relevance of these findings is that the deliberate use of interventions during coaching dialogue can be influenced through training with results noticeable in the workplace. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the training program studied can serve relatively large numbers of teacher coaches, as its setup requires a feasible amount of effort from schools and participants...|$|R

40|$|A {{coaching}} {{philosophy is}} important because it guides one's actions. So, a healthy philosophy will help a coach to make appropriate decisions. Therefore, by documenting a successful coach's philosophy other coaches will be able to gather information and ideas for their own philosophy. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the coaching techniques and philosophy of the second winningest men's volleyball coach in NCAA history. Coach Shondel has coached Ball State University men's volleyball teams for the past thirty-three years. Coach Shondell has compiled a 732 - 254 - 6 record for a. 741 winning percentage and was selected by the book titled, America's Greatest Coaches, as the second-best men's volleyball coach of all-time. In 1980 he was also named Ball State University's School of Physical Education Outstanding Teacher of the Year. Before data collection began, the experimenter was trained to use the Coaching Behavior Assessment System (CBAS). Next, the researcher observed and recorded four practice sessions using the CBAS. Following the <b>observations,</b> <b>coach</b> Shondell, two current players, and his assistant coach were interviewed. Topics discussed included motivation of athletes, teaching techniques, physical conditioning, team management, coaching motives, the coach-player relationship, as well as questions pertaining to behaviors observed using the CBAS. Through observations, interviews, and previous literature about coach Shondell, a philosophy emerged from six themes; specifically, practice is his domain, staying flexible and never feeling like he knows it all, trying to be posiitve with people, the relationship with his players is what's really important, trying to help athletes make their own decisions, and helping his players mature.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a current {{movement}} in regular education to develop skills {{in the teaching of}} art, art education has been largely ignored in special education. Discipline-based art education (DBAE) is a current model in art education that encourages continuous, sequential, content lessons in art. Art methologies, including a new emphasis on language skills, could be a powerful resource for special education teachers. A growing body of research on staff development suggests that procedures affecting teacher change include attending to teacher attitudes, using collaborative planning procedures, including follow-up coaching sessions, and delineating voluntary participation. In contrast, little research has been done to examine the change process during staff development concerning the relationships among practice, attitudes, and knowledge. The main focus {{of this study was to}} examine the process of change during staff development in art education with special education teachers. Seven teachers of special education were voluntary participants in a staff development program that addressed content and methodology in DBAE. The researcher served as the staff developer and in-classroom coach. Data concerning the teachers' practice, attitudes, and knowledge were collected by methods of video and audio tapes of classroom <b>observations</b> and <b>coaching,</b> prestudy and poststudy structured interviews, and attitude surveys. Data analyses were constructed addressing both individual teachers and the relationships between teachers in an effort to better understand the process of change during staff development.

These changes were evident on the attitude surveys, <b>observation</b> and <b>coaching</b> sessions, and when comparing prestudy and poststudy interviews. They involved the interaction of practice, attitudes, and knowledge. Those teachers who possessed a less sophisticated level of knowledge about art education prior to the study appeared to change at a greater rate than those with strong personal convictions.
