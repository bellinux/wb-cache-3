Early versions of the built-up <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> sides were {{in the form of}} a slatted open-top cage, made of rectangular steel rods. Later versions were constructed of sheet-metal. In the second example depicted, a Type XE1 tender with a sheet-metal extended <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> is plinthed with CGR 6th Class no. 356, an engine which is suited for Type [...] "Y_", not Type [...] "X_" [...] tenders.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} slatted upper {{sides of}} the Type XM2 tender's <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> were soon replaced by sheet-metal sides.

50|$|The {{trimmers}} worked {{inside the}} <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers</b> located {{on top of}} and between the boilers. Trimmers used shovels and wheelbarrows to move <b>coal</b> around the <b>bunkers</b> {{in order to keep}} the coal level, and to shovel the coal down the coal chute to the firemen below, who shoveled it into the furnaces. If too much coal built up on one side of a <b>coal</b> <b>bunker,</b> the ship would actually list to that side.|$|R

50|$|The South African Railways also {{operated}} a Double Pacific {{version of the}} Union Garratt articulated locomotive. The Union Garratt was a hybrid locomotive, partly Modified Fairlie and partly Garratt. The front end was of a typical Garratt arrangement, with a water tank mounted on the front engine unit’s frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion, with the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive’s main frame and with the pivoting rear engine unit positioned beneath the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker.</b> It had an additional large underbelly water tank under the boiler. The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab, <b>coal</b> <b>bunker,</b> {{as well as the}} underbelly water tank. As a result, like the Modified Fairlies, the Union Garratts were prone to metal fatigue and cracking of the frames. In the case of the Union Garratts, this occurred particularly at the rear, brought about by the long frame overhang laden with the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, the Discovery Channel {{produced}} {{an episode of}} the Unsolved History documentaries titled [...] "Death of the U.S.S. Maine" [...] that used photographic evidence, naval experts, and archival information to {{determine the cause of}} the explosion. Its conclusion was that a <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> fire caused the explosion, and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the <b>coal</b> and powder <b>bunkers</b> that allowed the fire to spread from the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> to the powder bunker.|$|R
50|$|Coaling {{was carried}} out by hand from <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers.</b> <b>Coal</b> was shovelled onto a {{platform}} and from there into the locomotive's coal tank. Later simple cranes or derricks were installed.|$|R

50|$|Although {{they were}} now more {{powerful}} than the F class and were reasonably successful, the FA class was hampered like the LA 4-4-0T rebuilds in that their <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers</b> were too small. The decision was made in 1897 to extend the frames of F 9, then undergoing conversion at Addington Workshops, and fit an extended <b>coal</b> <b>bunker.</b> To accommodate this, a two-wheeled trailing truck would be added.|$|R
50|$|Compared to builder's pictures, {{which show}} the {{locomotives}} and tenders as built, pictures {{of most of}} these locomotives in service show them with a modified tender with built-up sides to the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> to increase the coal capacity. Early versions of the built-up <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> sides were {{in the form of}} a slatted open-top cage, made of rectangular steel rods. Later versions were constructed of sheet-metal.|$|R
50|$|While {{the tender}} was similar in general {{appearance}} and dimensions {{and had the}} same wheelbase as the Type MY tender of the Class 24, it had a different <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> top design. As {{was done with the}} tenders of the Classes S and S1 shunting locomotives, the top sides of the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> were scalloped out to improve the crew's rearward field of vision.|$|R
5000|$|... 73 trimmers, or coal trimmers, on the Titanic. Of the {{engineering}} crew, the trimmers were paid the least and had {{probably the worst}} job of the crew. The trimmers worked inside the <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers</b> located on top of and between the boilers. The trimmers used shovels and wheelbarrows to move <b>coal</b> around the <b>bunker</b> to keep the coal level, and to shovel the coal down the coal chute to the firemen below to shovel it into the furnaces. If too much coal built up {{on one side of}} a <b>coal</b> <b>bunker,</b> the ship would actually list to that side. All the residual heat from the boilers rose up into the <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers,</b> and inside, the bunkers were poorly lighted, full of coal dust, and extremely hot from the boilers. Around 20 of them survived.|$|R

Since the locomotive was neither Garratt nor Modified Fairlie, its unique configuration was dubbed Union Garratt.|$|R
