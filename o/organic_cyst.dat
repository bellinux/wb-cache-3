The associations and relationships have been established by visual examination of the dataset and the multivariate ordination techniques, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis.

The Lomonosov Ridge was still partially subaerial during the latest Paleocene and earliest Eocene and gradually subsided during the early Eocene. <b>Organic</b> dinoflagellate <b>cyst</b> (dinocyst) assemblages point to brackish and productive surface waters throughout the latest Paleocene and early Eocene.

Inorganic geochemistry generally reflects reducing conditions within the sediment and euxinic conditions during the upper lower Eocene. Spectral analysis reveals that the cyclicity, recorded in X-ray fluorescence scanning Fe data from close to Eocene thermal maximum 2 (~ 53 Ma, presence confirmed by dinocyst stratigraphy), is related to precession. Within {{the lower part of the}} PETM, proxy records indicate enhanced weathering, runoff, anoxia, and productivity along with sea level rise.

40|$|NSERC; ACENET Post-Doctoral FellowshipGlobal biogeographic {{patterns}} and environmental correlates {{of diversity and}} size structure of extant marine <b>organic</b> dinoflagellate <b>cysts</b> were determined. Dinoflagellate cyst diversity, like that of many other terrestrial and marine groups, is lowest at the poles and higher at lower latitudes. Temperature is responsible {{for much of the}} positive correlation between dinoflagellate cyst diversity and latitude. In contrast, the most obvious correlate with the median size of dinoflagellate cysts is the depth of the water column, especially in warm-water regions, perhaps due to changes in mixing regime and the advantages associated with the lower sinking rates and lower nutrient requirements of smaller species in offshore waters. The unique biogeographic pattern in dinoflagellate cyst diversity may reflect the unique physiological features of dinoflagellates: preference for warm, stable water columns, slower inherent growth rates, and their ability to act as mixotrophs or heterotrophs. Dinoflagellates tend to be 'gleaners', slow-growers adapted to oligotrophic conditions and less sensitive to inorganic nutrient supply, as compared to inorganic resource 'opportunists' with high growth rates, such as diatoms. These ecophysiological differences between dinoflagellates and other functional groups, such as diatoms and coccolithophores, may account for the major differences in the biogeographic and latitudinal diversity gradients between these groups...|$|R

However, hardly any data is available for organic cyst-forming dinoflagellates while this is an ecologically important group with a unique fossil record. We performed dilute batch experiments with four harmful dinoflagellate species known for their ability to form organic cysts: Alexandrium tamarense, Scrippsiella trochoidea, Gonyaulax spinifera and Protoceratium reticulatum. Cells were grown at a range of dissolved CO 2 concentrations characterizing past, modern and projected future values (~ 5 – 50 µmol L- 1), representing atmospheric pCO 2 of 180, 380, 800 and 1200 µatm. In all tested species, 13 C fractionation depends on CO 2 with a slope of up to 0. 17 ‰ (µmol L) - 1. Even more consistent correlations were found between 13 C fractionation and the combined effects of particulate organic carbon quota (POC quota; pg C cell- 1) and CO 2. Carbon isotope fractionation as well as its response to CO 2 is species-specific. These results may be interpreted as a first step towards a proxy for past pCO 2 based on carbon isotope ratios of fossil <b>organic</b> dinoflagellate <b>cysts.</b> However, additional culture experiments focusing on environmental variables other than pCO 2, physiological underpinning of the recorded response, testing for possible offsets in 13 C values between cells and cysts, as well as field calibration studies are required to establish a reliable proxy...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{the early}} Palaeogene palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological {{evolution}} of the Polar Regions is hindered {{by the absence of}} calcite microfossils in sedimentary archives, which are conventionally the main dating tool. To overcome this problem, we have generated large datasets of <b>organic</b> dinoflagellate <b>cyst</b> (dinocyst) assemblages fromSouthern Ocean shelf sediments over the past decade, and we here calibrate these to the Geomagnetic Polarity TimeScale (GPTS) using magnetostratigraphy and stable isotope stratigraphy. This {{now for the first time}} allows a high-resolution Southern Pacific Ocean dinocyst zonation for the late Palaeocene to late Eocene (58 – 36 million years ago; Ma). We compile published dinocyst chronologies from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 1171 D on the South Tasman Rise, Hole 1172 A/D on the East Tasman Plateau and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Hole U 1356 A on the Wilkes Land margin. Correlation to dinocyst zonations from New Zealand lead to revisions of the magnetostratigraphic age model at Holes 1171 D and 1172 A/D. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope records reveal the stratigraphic location of the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 Ma) and the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (40 Ma), respectively. The resulting zonation consists of thirteen dinocyst zones, calibrated to the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) of Vandenberghe et al. (2012), which can likely be applied to the entire Southern Ocean. Finally,we apply the revised stratigraphy to all published TEX 86 data, a biomarker-based proxy for sea surface temperature (SST), from ODP Site 1172 to assess long-term climate evolution.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem of}} the nature and age of the Rupelian-Chattian (Early-Late Oligocene) unconformity in its type region is here approached using <b>organic</b> walled dinoflagellate <b>cyst</b> (dinocyst) correlations between the North Sea Basin and well-calibrated central Italian (Tethyan Ocean) sections. Useful Oligocene dinocyst events are the last occurrence of Enneadocysta pectiniformis (~ 29. 3 Ma), and the first occurrences of Saturnodinium pansum (~ 29. 4 Ma), Distatodinium biffii (~ 27. 9 Ma) and Artemisiocysta cladodichotoma (~ 26. 7 Ma). The latter event marks the earliest Chattian. The improved correlations indicate that the Rupelian-Chattian (R-C) boundary is associated with the so-called ‘Oligocene Glacial Maximum’. This phase of important global cooling and glacio-eustatic sea level fall is genetically related to the unconformity between the classic Oligocene stages. Subsequent global warming (so-called ‘Late Oligocene Warming Event’), induced a major sea level rise, leading e. g. to the time-transgressive deposition of the typical basal Chattian glauconitic sands. The oldest of the Chattian units have a GPTS age of ~ 26. 7 Ma. It further appears that a hiatus of ~ 500 kyrs spans the classic Rupelian-Chattian unconformity...|$|R
40|$|A brief (~ 150 kyr) {{period of}} {{widespread}} global average surface warming marks the transition between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs, ~ 56 million years ago. This so-called "Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum" (PETM) {{is associated with}} the massive injection of 13 C-depleted carbon, reflected in a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE). Biotic responses include a global abundance peak (acme) of the subtropical dinoflagellate Apectodinium. Here we identify the PETM in a marine sedimentary sequence deposited on the East Tasman Plateau at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1172 and show, based on the organic paleothermometer TEX 86 , that southwest Pacific sea surface temperatures increased from ~ 26 °C to ~ 33 °C during the PETM. Such temperatures before, during and after the PETM are > 10 °C warmer than predicted by paleoclimate model simulations for this latitude. In part, this discrepancy may be explained by potential seasonal biases in the TEX 86 proxy in polar oceans. Additionally, the data suggest that not only Arctic, but also Antarctic temperatures may be underestimated in simulations of ancient greenhouse climates by current generation fully coupled climate models. An early influx of abundant Apectodinium confirms that environmental change preceded the CIE on a global scale. <b>Organic</b> dinoflagellate <b>cyst</b> assemblages suggest a local decrease in the amount of river run off reaching the core site during the PETM, possibly in concert with eustatic rise. Moreover, the assemblages suggest changes in seasonality of the regional hydrological system and storm activity.

40|$|Summary. Meseres corlissi Petz et Foissner, 1992 is a planktonic, spirotrich ciliate {{closely related}} to the common Halteria grandinella. Pure {{cultures}} were established with Cryptomonas sp. as a main food source. Thus, resting cyst formation and structure could be studied by light and scanning electron microscopy and cytochemical methods. The resting cyst of M. corlissi belongs to the kinetosome-resorbing (KR) type and has a conspicuous coat of extracellular organic scales, here termed lepidosomes, embedded in mucus mainly composed of acid mucopolysaccharides, as shown by the strong reaction with alcian blue. The lepidosomes, which likely consist of glycoproteins, are finely faceted, hollow spheres with a diameter of 2 - 14 µm. They are formed underneath the cortex and liberated almost concomitantly to the external surface of the cell before the cyst wall is produced. Resting cyst size is dependent on temperature, the average diameter is 46 µm (without lepidosome coat) at 20 °C. The cyst wall, which contains considerable amounts of glycoproteins and a layer of chitin, is smooth, 1. 5 - 2 µm thick, and composed, in the light microscope, of two distinct layers highly resistant to various inorganic and <b>organic</b> solvents.

Dinocyst results obtained for 196 samples from the 405 m long core offer the highest resolution (~ 22 kyr) stratigraphically well-constrained data set available to date for the Turonian Stage, 93. 9 – 89. 8 Ma. A dinocyst biostratigraphic framework is presented based on the evolutionary first and last occurrence, first common occurrence, and acmes of key species. Published dinocyst data from English Turonian Chalk successions in East Sussex, Berkshire, Kent and Norfolk are reviewed within a stratigraphic framework provided by macrofossil records and carbon isotope event (CIE) chemostratigraphy. Critical analysis of existing published Turonian dinocyst zonation schemes shows them to be untenable. Correlation of the English Chalk data to Bch- 1 provides a basis for defining a regional dinocyst event stratigraphy with 22 datum levels, and a revised dinocyst zonation scheme constrained within a chemostratigraphic framework of 10 major CIEs.

The uppermost Cretaceous-lowermost Oligocene succession of Site 1172 has a confident biomagnetostratigraphy, enabling us to tie early Paleogene Southern Hemisphere dinocyst events to the geomagnetic polarity timescale for the first time. Dinocyst species from the Maastrichtian to earliest Oligocene at Site 1172 are largely endemic ("Transantarctic Flora") or bipolar; cosmopolitan taxa are present in the background as well. The Maastrichtian-early late Eocene dinocyst assemblages are indicative of shallow-marine to restricted marine, pro-deltaic conditions, closely tied to a massive siliciclastic sequence. By middle late Eocene times (~ 35. 5 Ma), the siliciclastic sequence gave way to a thin glauconitic unit, considered to reflect the deepening of the Tasmanian Gateway. This transition coincides with the most prominent change in dinocyst associations of the Paleogene. The turnover is inferred to reflect a change from marginal marine to more offshore conditions, with increased winnowing and oxidation. Overlying pelagic carbonate ooze of middle early Oligocene and younger age is virtually barren of organic microfossils, although Quaternary assemblages have been recovered. This aspect is taken to reflect average low sedimentation rates and well-oxygenated water masses during most of the Oligocene and Neogene.

A decline in primary forest taxa (e. g. Agathis, Allophylus, Dacrycarpus, Dacrydium, Dipterocarpaceae, Phyllocladus, and Podocarpus) suggest that the major change in vegetation {{is caused by the}} forest canopy opening that can be related to human activity. The successively increase of pollen of pioneer canopy and herb taxa (e. g. Acalypha, Ficus, Macaranga/Mallotus, Trema, Pandanus) indicate the development of a secondary vegetation. In Java these changes started much earlier (ca at 2950 cal yr BP) then in Kalimantan (ca at 910 cal yr BP) and seem to be more severe. Changes in the marine realm, reflected by the dinoflagellate cyst association correspond to changes in vegetation on land. They reflect a gradual change from relatively well ventilated to more hypoxic bottom/pore water conditions in a more eutrophic environment. Near the coast of Java, the shift of the water trophic status took place between ca 820 and 500 cal yrs BP, while near the coast of Kalimantan it occurred as late as {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. We observe an increasing amount of the cyst of Polykrikos schwarzii, cyst of P. kofoidii, Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and Selenopemphix nephroides at times of secondary vegetation development on land, suggesting that these species react strongly on human induced changes in the marine environment, probably related to increased pollution and eutrophication...|$|R

A central issue is to identify the global environmental changes which are responsible for the Eocene cooling and its underlying mechanisms with the focus on the Oligocene isotope- 1 (Oi- 1) event, thought to mark the onset of major Antarctic glaciation. Two low-latitude sites were selected, Blake Nose (western North Atlantic) and Massignano (central Italy). For the first time a coherent taxonomy and biostratigraphy of dinocysts was established for the late Eocene at these latitudes. A high resolution correlation was established between the Massignano E/O Stratotype Section and the stratigraphically more extended ‘Massicore’. The composite section was used to analyse sea surface temperature (SST) change across the greenhouse-icehouse transition by means of dinocyst distribution. At Massignano, the Oi- 1 event was recognised both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the power spectrum of the SSTdino the ~ 100 and ~ 400 kyr eccentricity cycles may be distinguished and correlated with La 04. When orbitally tuned, the E/O GSSP dates ~ 100 kyr older than the Oi- 1 event. The boundary’s age could either be ~ 33. 75 or ~ 34. 1 Ma, both differ significantly from the ~ 33. 9 Ma age in the GTS 2004. Furthermore, when the data from the low-latitude sites were combined with extensive datasets from the Proto North Atlantic and adjacent regions, a suite of species sensitive to changes in SST was recognised. Their first and last occurrences reflect seven distinct phases of decreasing SSTs during the Middle Eocene to earliest Oligocene.

The gradual change of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in this section demonstrates that sedimentation was almost continuous during the time span of ca. 12 Ma. The biostratigraphic resolution based on dinoflagellate cyst events is generally finer than the calcareous nannofossil NP biozonation. A comparison with published dinoflagellate cyst data from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea shows that several important events are mainly synchronous throughout the region, suggesting a general similarity of the water masses. An isolated occurrence of Svalbardella suggests a short cooling event during early Bartonian times. The palynofacies in most of the section is almost purely of pelagic type. A more proximal, mid shelf palynofacies and a distinctive episode of reworking coincide with the Upper Eocene Moesgaard Clay and indicate a brief, but rather large sea level fall during the deposition of this unit. The Eocene/Oligocene boundary is tentatively identified near the base of the Viborg Formation, and approximately coincides with increased reworking of dinoflagellate cysts and a strong increase in bisaccate pollen, indicating more proximal conditions and possibly also a climatic cooling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Paleogene sediments of the {{southwest}} Tarim Basin along the West Kunlun Shan in western China include {{the remnants of the}} easternmost extent of a large epicontinental sea. This shallow sea once extended across the Eurasian continent before it retreated westward and eventually separated as the Paratethys Sea. Climate modeling results suggest that this sea retreat is an equally important forcing mechanism as the Tibetan plateau uplift in the aridification of the Asian continental interior and the intensification of the Asian monsoon system. The age and paleogeography of the retreat are poorly constrained, hindering the understanding of its cause and paleoenvironmental impacts. This study reports litho- and biostratigraphic results from two sections recording the last major regression out of the Tarim Basin that is expressed by a regional transition from marine clastics and limestones to continental red-beds. Rich micro- and macrofossil assemblages, including benthic foraminifera, ostracods, bivalves, calcareous nannofossils and <b>organic</b> walled dinoflagellate <b>cysts</b> (dinocysts), indicate a shallow, proximal and marine environment. Strong similarity to assemblages known from Central Asia and Europe confirms that surface­ocean connections extended across Eurasia from the Tarim Basin to the western Tethys during the latest Eocene. Moreover, the recovered fossil associations date the last marine sediments as earliest Priabonian in age (~ 37 Ma; overlap between dinoflagellate Mps Interval Zone and calcareous nannofossil Zone CP 14). The retreat of the sea from the Tarim Basin is timeequivalent with the sea level lowstand at the Bartonian­Priabonian boundary but pre-dates both the Oligocene­Miocene regional uplift of the Pamir mountains and Kunlun Shan and the major eustatic sea-level falls of the Eocene­Oligocene Transition (~ 34 Ma) and mid-Oligocene (~ 30 Ma), which are usually held responsible for the sea retreat. Furthermore, a concomitant and significant aridification step occurs at ~ 36. 6 Ma (top of chron C 17 n. 1 n) as recorded by regional sedimentary records of the Xining Basin along the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the Tarim Sea served as a significant moisture contributor for the Asian interior...|$|R
40|$|At Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 189 Sites 1170 - 1172, the climatologically {{critical}} Eocene-Oligocene (E-O) {{transition is}} barren of any calcareous microfossils but contains rich marine <b>organic</b> walled dinoflagellate <b>cyst</b> (dinocyst) and diatom assemblages, suitable for detailed biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental analysis. The resulting first-ever integrated dinocyst/diatom magnetostratigraphy allows confident correlation of the E-O interval between all Leg 189 sites, including Site 1168. Our correlations {{indicate that the}} (deep) opening of the Tasmanian Gateway occurred quasi-synchronously throughout the Tasmanian region, starting at ~ 35. 5 Ma. At Sites 1170 - 1172, quantitatively, three distinct dinocyst assemblages may be distinguished that reflect the relatively rapid and pronounced stepwise environmental changes associated with the E-O transition in the Tasmanian region, from a pro-deltaic setting to a deep marine pelagic setting. Moreover, synchronous with the deepening of the gateway, at the southern and eastern Sites 1170 - 1172, typical endemic Antarctic assemblages were replaced by more cosmopolitan dinocyst communities. In marked contrast, at Site 1168 off western Tasmania, endemic Antarctic taxa are virtually absent during the E-O transition. At Sites 1170 - 1172, the endemic Antarctic dinocyst assemblage (Transantarctic Flora) drastically changes into a more cosmopolitan assemblage at ~ 35. 5 Ma, with a more offshore character, reflecting the arrival of different oceanographic and environmental conditions associated with the deepening of the Tasmanian Gateway. In turn, this assemblage grades at ~ 34 Ma into one more typical for even more offshore and/or upwelling conditions at Site 1172. In slightly younger deposits at all sites, organic microfossils are virtually absent, reflecting winnowing and oxidation, indicative of a next step of oceanographic development. This phase may be dated {{as close to the}} Oceanic Anoxic (Oi) - 1 18 O (Antarctic glaciation) event (~ 33. 3 Ma). In a single productive sample from the earliest Oligocene the northern Site 1172, a relatively warm-water cosmopolitan assemblage has been recovered. This aspect contrasts findings from coeval deposits from the Ross Sea, where endemic Antarctic species remain dominant. Somewhere between the paleogeographic positions of Site 1172 and the Ross Sea, a strong differentiation of surface waters occurred in the earliest Oligocene, possibly reflecting the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current...|$|R

A forma tradicional de higienizaÃÃo de vegetais compreende a lavagem com Ãgua corrente seguida de imersÃo em soluÃÃo de cloro a 200 ppm e enxÃgÃe para remover as sujidades remanescentes e resÃduos do produto quÃmico. No entanto, alguns estudos apontam que esta sanitizaÃÃo nÃo garante a inocuidade das hortaliÃas, pois embora reduza a carga microbiana, nÃo Ã eficiente na eliminaÃÃo de algumas formas parasitÃrias. Diante disso, a presente pesquisa objetivou detectar microrganismos, protozoÃrios, helmintos e artrÃpodes em alfaces (Lactuca sativa, L.), variedade crespa, provenientes de cultivo convencional, orgÃnico e hidropÃnico, na sua forma in natura e apÃs dois mÃtodos de higienizaÃÃo: teste (aplicaÃÃo do detergente e soluÃÃo clorada a 200 ppm) e tradicional (uso apenas da soluÃÃo clorada a 200 ppm). Todas as alfaces estavam contaminadas por coliformes fecais, porÃm as amostras orgÃnicas e hidropÃnicas apresentaram valores mÃdios dentro do padrÃo estipulado pela legislaÃÃo, (21 Â 74 NMP/g e 24 Â 40 NMP/g, respectivamente) ao contrÃrio das convencionais (152 Â 286 NMP/g). Em 100 % das amostras de alfaces convencionais e orgÃnicas nÃo apresentaram contaminaÃÃo por Salmonella sp., mas 20 % das amostras hidropÃnicas estavam contaminadas por esse patÃgeno, sendo classificadas como imprÃprias para consumo. Nas anÃlises parasitolÃgicas foram detectados organismos potencialmente patogÃnicos para o homem: cistos Giardia sp. (2), ovos de Ascaris sp. (6) e ovo de Taenia sp. (1), com seis ocorrÃncias em alfaces convencionais e trÃs em orgÃnicas. Foram ainda detectados cistos de ameba e larvas de nematÃdeos morfologicamente anÃlogos aos que se encontra no homem, porÃm mais provavelmente eram formas de vida livre provenientes da terra. Foram observadas em abundÃncia formas de vida livre entre os protozoÃrios, os helmintos nematÃdeos, e os artrÃpodes (estes com destaque nas alfaces hidropÃnicas) veiculados nas sujidades das alfaces, refletindo a composiÃÃo dos ambientes de cultivo. Avaliando os dois processos de sanitizaÃÃo estudados constatou-se que a mÃdia dos valores de coliforme fecal nos diferentes tipos de alfaces foi menor no mÃtodo teste do que no tradicional, evidenciando maior eficiÃncia. A etapa da prÃ-lavagem reduziu em 60 % a contaminaÃÃo inicial de coliformes fecais; a lavagem com detergente foi eficaz quando comparada com a reduÃÃo obtida na etapa seguinte. O mÃtodo tradicional promoveu diminuiÃÃo significativa na contaminaÃÃo inicial de coliformes fecais, no entanto, nÃo houve diferenÃa significativa quando comparada com o mÃtodo teste nem com a etapa da lavagem com detergente isoladamente, comprovando mais uma vez a eficÃcia deste Ãltimo. Para a remoÃÃo das formas de helmintos, protozoÃrios e artrÃpodes em geral, ambos os mÃtodos foram eficientes, sem apresentarem diferenÃa significativa. Quando foram analisadas separadamente as diferentes etapas dos procedimentos de higienizaÃÃo, constatou-se que houve significÃncia estatÃstica para a remoÃÃo de helmintos, com melhor eficiÃncia do procedimento teste, podendo-se sugerir que a higienizaÃÃo realizada apenas com detergente alcanÃaria os mesmos resultados de detergente e cloro. Deste modo, concluÃmos que a higienizaÃÃo teste, tanto para a remoÃÃo de helmintos como para a reduÃÃo de coliformes fecais, apresentou maior eficÃcia. The vegetables sanity {{that are}} eaten raw is a relevant factor to health must be ensured by sanitizing with chemicals that have effective action to eliminate, reduce and / or removal of contaminants. The {{traditional way of}} cleaning includes washing vegetables under running water followed by immersion in 200 ppm chlorine solution and rinse to remove dirt and remnants of the chemical waste. However, some studies indicate that this sanitization does not guarantee the safety of vegetables, for though while reduces the microbial load, it is not efficient in the elimination of some parasitic forms. Therefore, this study aimed to detect microorganisms, protozoa, helminths and arthropods in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), curly variety, from conventional farming, organic and hydroponic, in its fresh form and after two methods of cleaning: test (application of detergent and chlorine solution to 200 ppm) and traditional (use of only a 200 ppm chlorine solution). All lettuce were contaminated by fecal coliforms, but the hydroponic and organic samples had mean values within the standard stipulated by law, 21 Â 74 NMP/g and 24 Â 40 NMP/g, respectively) unlike the conventional (152 Â 286 NMP/g). In 100 % of the samples of conventional and organic lettuces were not contaminated with Salmonella sp. but 20 % of hydroponic samples were contaminated by this pathogen, being classified as unfit for consumption. In parasitological analyses were detected in organisms potentially pathogenic to humans: Giardia sp cysts. (2), eggs of Ascaris sp. (6) and eggs of Taenia sp. (1), with six occurrence in three lettuces in conventional and <b>organic.</b> Giardia sp <b>cysts.</b> (2), eggs of Ascaris sp. (6) and eggs of Taenia sp. (1), with six occurrence in three lettuces in conventional and organic. Yet been detected amoeba cysts and larvae of nematodes morphologically {{similar to those found}} in man, but more likely were forms of life free from the earth. Forms were observed in abundance among free-living protozoa, nematodes, helminths, and arthropods (especially those in hydroponic lettuce) served in lettuce dirt, reflecting the composition of culture environments. Evaluating the two processes of sanitization studied {{it was found that the}} mean of fecal coliform in the different types of lettuce was lower in the test method than the traditional, with increased efficiency. The stage of pre-washing reduced by 60 % the initial contamination of fecal coliform, the detergent wash was effective when compared with the reduction achieved in the next step. The traditional method promoted significant decrease in the initial contamination of fecal coliform bacteria, however, no significant difference when compared with the test method or with the step of washing with detergent alone, proving once again its effectiveness. For removal of the forms of helminths, protozoa and arthropods in general, both methods were effective, showing no significant difference. When analyzed separately the different stages of cleaning procedures, it was found that there were significant for the removal of helminths, with better efficiency of the testing procedure, which may suggest that the cleaning with detergent performed only achieve the same results of detergent and chlorine. Thus, we conclude that test hygienization, both for the removal of helminths as to reduce fecal coliform bacteria, showed greater efficacy...|$|R
