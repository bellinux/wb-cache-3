Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E
5|$|Shannen Says is an eight-episode American reality {{television}} series which was broadcast on WE tv from April 10 to May 13, 2012. It focused on {{preparations for the}} wedding of actress Shannen Doherty and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. The series' premise originated from a discussion between Doherty and Iswarienko about providing a look into their lives and document the stress <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of planning their wedding. The series' executive producers included Doherty, Iswarienko, Kathleen Farrell, Tom Forman, and Russell Heldt. It was filmed in Malibu, California over a seven-week period, and was produced by RelativityREAL and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video under the title Shannen Says, Season 1, but was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|Tribunes {{could use}} their sacrosanctity {{to order the}} use of capital {{punishment}} against any person who interfered with their duties. Tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual, such as when arresting someone. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of rare occasions (such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus), a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction, which could involve a broad veto over all governmental functions. While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or the magistrates, he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if {{there had never been}} a veto.|$|E

30|$|The {{existence}} and uniqueness theorems of a fixed point in complete metric spaces {{play an important}} role in constructing methods for solving problems in differential equations, matrix equations, and integral equations. Furthermore, the fixed point theory is a crucial method in numerical analysis to present a way for solving and approximating the roots of many equations in real analysis. One of the main theorems <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fixed point is the Banach contraction theorem [1]. Many authors generalized the Banach contraction theorem in different metric spaces in different ways. For some works on fixed point theory, we refer the readers to [2 – 17]. The study of <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> fixed point was initiated by Bhaskar and Lakshmikantham [18]. Bhaskar and Lakshmikantham [18] obtained some nice results <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> fixed point and applied their results to solve a pair of differential equations.
