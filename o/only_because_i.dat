500|$|Gandhi {{credited}} Shrimad Rajchandra, a {{poet and}} Jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor. In Modern Review, June 1930, Gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at Dr. P.J. Mehta's residence in Bombay. Gandhi exchanged letters with Rajchandra {{when he was in}} South Africa, referring to him as Kavi (literally, [...] "poet"). In 1930, Gandhi wrote, [...] "Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now." [...] 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi. But Kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had come in closest personal touch with him.' ...|$|E
500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the hell out of me <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E

500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October. After being cast and seeing {{a picture of the}} comic version of the character, Everett felt [...] "'They got the wrong girl,' <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> look nothing like her. I was very nervous about it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm going to need to work out a bit. And those are some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|E
500|$|John F. Stossel {{was born}} on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago's {{affluent}} North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as [...] "the superstar of the family", commenting, [...] "While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School." [...] Stossel characterizes himself as having been [...] "an indifferent student" [...] while in college, commenting, [...] "I daydreamed through half my classes at Princeton, and applied to grad school <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was ambitious, and grad school seemed like the right path for a 21-year-old who wanted to get ahead." [...] Although he had been accepted to the University of Chicago's School of Hospital Management, Stossel was [...] "sick of school" [...] and thought taking a job would inspire him to embrace graduate studies with renewed vigor.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{an entry}} in Mayakovsky's diary, commenting upon the reasons of his self-imposed exile: [...] "Here I sit alone, but <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am willing to.

Recalling the race, Dibaba said, [...] "I competed in Paris <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had the 'A' standard. No one expected me to win. There was no pressure from anywhere.

Well, that's putting it pompously – but constructing. I do see it in sort of three-dimensional structures.

2500|$|Duterte has [...] "bragged {{about his}} Viagra-fuelled serial adultery", drawing {{criticism}} from the GABRIELA Women's Party. He told supporters {{at a rally in}} 2015: [...] "When I was young, I could do overnight, which is more expensive. When I got old, I could do short time <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have such a short time left. After one erection, that’s it. No more. Without Viagra, it’s even more difficult." [...] Despite one of its representatives Luz Ilagan once stated that the people should focus on his track record and not on his womanizing ways, GABRIELA national chairperson Emmi de Jesus reiterated its stance against Duterte.|$|E

Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, [...] "I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> used to like telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way.
