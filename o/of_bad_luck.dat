5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E

He is successful in downing the aircraft and lands to retrieve a souvenir of his victory. The owner of the land where David's aircraft crashed urges Jack to come to the dying man's side. He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes what he has done. David consoles him and before he dies, forgives his comrade.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Japan, rules {{governing}} jitsuin design are so stringent and each design so unique {{that the vast}} majority of people entrust the creation of their jitsuin to a professional, paying upward of US$20 and more often closer to US$100, and will use it for decades.

25|$|Doomed by {{fire and}} daunted by flood, McKinnon had his share <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> with mills. His sawmill, many times damaged by ice and shifted off its {{location}} by the 1861 flood, lasted until it burned in January 1942. The 1844 flour mill was rebuilt twice following fires in 1862 and 1876 and remained until Sept. 6, 1969 when fire struck {{again for the}} last time. The 1848 woollen mill burned and was rebuilt in 1863 but was left down after claimed arson took it in 1881, two years following McKinnon’s death.|$|E

25|$|Arguably Stuart's {{most famous}} campaign, Gettysburg, was marred {{when he was}} {{surprised}} by a Union cavalry attack at the Battle of Brandy Station and by his separation from Lee's army for an extended period, leaving Lee unaware of Union troop movements and contributing to the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. Stuart received significant criticism from the Southern press {{as well as the}} postbellum proponents of the Lost Cause movement, but historians have failed to agree on whether Stuart's exploit was entirely the fault of his judgment or simply a result <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> and Lee's less-than-explicit orders.|$|E
25|$|Having {{narrowly}} escaped ambush by FBI {{agents and}} {{other law enforcement}} agencies several times after the Kansas City Massacre, Floyd had a stroke <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck.</b> On October 18, 1934, he and Richetti left Buffalo, New York, and their vehicle slid into a telephone pole in heavy fog. No one was injured, but the car was disabled. Fearing they would be recognized, Floyd and Richetti sent two female companions to get a tow truck; they planned to have the women accompany the tow truck driver into a town and have the vehicle repaired, while the two men waited by the roadside.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} protagonists, Mihai {{is the most}} level-headed, experienced, and least anti-heroic of the group.

However, Mihai has a terrible sense of {{direction}} and has a constant run <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck.</b> He and Badou share a close bond along with Kiri and Mimi, and also shares concern for Heine and Naoto. So far, his link to the underground is not as deep as the others, but Richter Berthein seems to {{know a great deal}} about the assassin.|$|E

25|$|Progressive, solid, and unspectacular, Democrat Lawrence W. Wetherby {{served as}} {{governor}} during 1950–55. As lieutenant governor under Earle Clements, {{he was out}} of the limelight. After Clements moved on to the US Senate, Wetherby took over and was elected to his own term in 1951, emphasizing the themes of roads, tourism, and economic development. One of the few Southern governors who worked to carry out desegregation after the Brown Decision in 1954, Wetherby's administration ran into a string <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> and its candidate for governor, Bert T.

25|$|In the mid 20th century, art {{historian}} Volker Herzner noted the facial {{similarity between the}} Cumaean Sibyl and Philip's wife Isabella of Portugal, especially as she is portrayed in van Eyck's lost 1428–29 betrothal portrait. Herzner speculated that the text in the banderole in the sibyl's panel has a double meaning, referring {{not only to the}} coming of Christ, but also to the 1432 birth of Philip's first son and heir to survive infancy. Others reject this idea, given the high rates of infant mortality at the time, and the connotations <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> usually associated with acclaiming a son before he is born.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock's {{first few}} films faced a string <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>luck.</b> His first {{directing}} project came in 1922 with the aptly titled Number 13, filmed in London. The production was cancelled because of financial problems; the few scenes {{that had been}} finished at that point have been lost. Michael Balcon gave Hitchcock another opportunity for a directing credit with The Pleasure Garden (1925), a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka, which he made at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich {{in the summer of}} 1925. The film was a commercial flop. Next, Hitchcock directed a drama called The Mountain Eagle (1926), possibly released under the title Fear o' God, in the United States. This film is lost.|$|E
