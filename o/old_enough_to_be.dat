5|$|The {{raising of}} school leaving age (shortened to ROSLA) {{is the name}} given by the {{government}} to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave compulsory education as specified under an Education Act. In most countries, the school leaving age often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try to feed and raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left alone for short periods of time, Marta takes over {{the bulk of the}} hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them the ways of the wolf. In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E

5|$|The American Quarter Pony Association {{was begun}} in 1964 with {{the ideals of}} a {{registry}} which would register small horses and ponies of western type, whose breeding could be unknown but which were desirable for breeding purposes. Crossbred and purebred animals are eligible for registration, as are animals registered with other registries that meet the entry requirements. In 1975, the National Quarter Pony Association was begun to preserve the smaller, stockier type Quarter Horse when breeding trends were leaning towards taller, leaner animals. The AQPA now registers horses in several foreign countries, {{as well as all}} US states and Canadian provinces. The International Quarter Pony Association, begun in the 1970s, also registers Quarter Ponies, and is a worldwide association for ponies of Quarter Horse type. The Quarter Pony Association is an association affiliated with the International Quarter Pony Association, with the goal of promoting the Quarter Pony. In 2005, the IQPA and the QPA became one organization, with the IQPA acting as the registry and the QPA as the membership branch. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Quarter Ponies registered with all registering organizations. Registries say that registrations of adult animals outnumber those for foals every year, as many owners wait until the pony is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown under saddle before registering them.|$|E

It is {{said that}} Elizabeth Pratt was 35 {{years old when she}} married Charles Morton in 1791 and therefore <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> Charles Carr Morton's mother. However, Charles Carr Morton was married only 8 years after Elizabeth Pratt's marriage to Morton.|$|R
25|$|Gregorio Fuentes, who {{many critics}} believe was an {{inspiration}} for Santiago, was a blue-eyed man born on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. After going to sea at age ten on ships that called in African ports, he migrated permanently to Cuba when he was 22. After 82 years in Cuba, Fuentes attempted to reclaim his Spanish citizenship in 2001. Critics have noted that Santiago was also at least 22 when he immigrated from Spain to Cuba, and thus <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered an immigrant—and a foreigner—in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|The {{dates of}} his {{lifetime}} are not recorded, but extrapolated from writings that {{have survived the}} ages. In Protagoras Plato wrote that, before a gathering of Socrates, Prodicus, and Hippias, Protagoras stated that he was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the father of any of them. This suggests a birth date of not later than 490 BC. In the Meno {{he is said to}} have died at approximately the age of 70, after 40 years as a practicing Sophist. His death, then, may be presumed to have occurred circa 420 BC, but is not known for certain, since assumptions about it are based on an apparently fake story about his trial for impiety in Athens.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, {{although}} not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected, Clay was appointed {{a representative of}} Fayette County in the Kentucky General Assembly. Clay's first legislative initiative was the partisan gerrymander of Kentucky's Electoral College districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for Thomas Jefferson in the 1804 presidential election. Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and Clay unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from Frankfort to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed Felix Grundy, a populist firebrand who unsuccessfully sought to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. Clay defeated Grundy's former initiative, as well as Grundy's attempt to elect John Adair to the Senate. Clay instead backed the successful candidacy of Buckner Thruston, who also hailed from the Bluegrass Region. Clay also advocated for internal improvements, which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.|$|E

25|$|Donnchad {{was the son}} of Brian (king of Munster) and {{his wife}} Gormlaith (daughter of Murchad, king of Leinster). His year of birth is unknown, but a date 980s is likely, as it would accord with the {{political}} policy of his father at the time and mean that Donnchad was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> militarily active in the 1010s, when he first appears in historical records. Brian's son Murchad, Donnchad's half-brother, died with his father at Clontarf. Another brother or half-brother, Domnall, had died in 1011. Two other half-brothers, Conchobar and Flann, are mentioned in some sources but leave no trace in the Irish annals. So, of Brian's sons, only Donnchad and his half-brother Tadc are known to have survived their father. According to Geoffrey Keating's account in Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, an account which is not backed by any annalistic evidence, Donnchad, leading the survivors of the Dál gCais back from Clontarf faced armies from Osraige and Munster which were faced down.|$|E
25|$|Equites (cavalry): The cavalry was {{originally}} {{the most prestigious}} unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more lances. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of circa 3,000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units (turmae) of 30 men. These men were commanded by decurions. In addition to heavy cavalry, {{there would be the}} light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the hastati or the equites. In battle, they were used to disrupt and outflank enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount {{some or all of the}} horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before stirrups.|$|E

500|$|Richard and Anne had one son, {{born between}} 1474 and 1476, Edward of Middleham, who was created Earl of Salisbury on 15 February 1478. He died in April 1484, after being created Prince of Wales on 8 September the {{previous}} year, {{and only two}} months after formally being declared heir apparent. Richard also had two acknowledged illegitimate children: John of Gloucester (also known as [...] "John of Pontefract"), who was appointed Captain of Calais in 1485, and Katherine Plantagenet who married William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, in 1484. Neither their birth dates nor {{the names of their}} mothers are documented, but since Katherine was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wedded in 1484 (age of consent was 12) and John was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> knighted in September 1483 in York Minster (when his half brother Edward, Richard's only legitimate heir, was invested Prince of Wales) and to be made Captain of Calais in March 1485, most historians agree that they were fathered during Richard's teen years. There is no trace of infidelity on Richard's part after his marriage to Anne Neville in 1472, when he was around 20, hence the suggestion by A.L. Rowse that Gloucester 'had no interest in sex.' ...|$|E

The struggle to preserve the Star Ferry and, later, the Queen's Pier, was the occasion to raise questions on Hong Kong's history, the question of colonialism, and that of democracy in the HKSAR.|$|E
