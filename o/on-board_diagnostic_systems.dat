40|$|New {{emission}} legislations {{introduced in}} the European Union and the U. S. have made truck manufacturers face stricter requirements for low emissions and <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>systems.</b> The on-board diagnostic system typically consists of several tests that are run when the truck is driving. One way to construct such tests is to use so called consistency relations. A consistency relation is a relation with known variables that in the fault free case always holds. Calculation of a consistency relation typically involves eliminating unknown variables from a set of equations. To eliminate variables from a differential polynomial system, methods from differential algebra can be used. In this thesis, the purely algebraic Gröbner basis algorithm and the differential Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm implemented in the Maple package Diffalg have been compared and evaluated. The conclusion drawn {{is that there are}} {{no significant differences between the}} methods. However, since using Gröbner basis requires differentiations to be made in advance, the recommendation is to use the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm. Further, attempts to calculate consistency relations using the Rosenfeld-Gröbner algorithm have been made to a real application, a model of a Scania diesel engine. These attempts did not yield any successful results. It was only possible to calculate one consistency relation. This can be explained by the high complexity of the model...|$|E

40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency and European Commission are {{requiring}} in-situ <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>systems</b> {{to increase}} accuracy in monitoring nitrous oxides and particulate matter vehicle emissions. Particulate Matter (PM) sensors are a derivative of this regulation {{and have been}} implemented to assess diesel particulate filter failure, as well as solid particle number. The design of PM sensors is varied by company (e. g., Honeywell, Bosch, Emisense, and Delphi) {{in addition to the}} applied method. The method of investigation in this study is electrical charging and the capacity for corona discharge generation. Boltzmann’s Law for charged particles is generally used to predict electrical charging (i. e., particle charging). However, the PM sensor design and method in this study generates a signal that is amplified higher than can be theoretically explained by this law. Signal amplification can only be attributed to ionization due to the presence of corona discharge, besides particle charging in an electric field. A fundamental study probing into the effects of corona discharge on PM sensor signal amplification is necessary to understand the underlying operational principles of the sensor. This study will provide qualitative insights into the electrical properties of PM and the conditions in which electrical properties are influenced by varying physical conditions. The investigation is performed by correlating sensor response to varying physical conditions of PM. The results show that the sensor response is linearly dependent on particle concentration and that signal strength is limited on the sample flow rate. Understanding the operational principles of this design could lead {{to the development of a}} relatively inexpensive PM sensor with unprecedented high signal sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Robust, {{low-cost}} mobile sensing enables effective {{monitoring and}} management of urban environment and infrastructure which contributes towards a sustainable future. While mobile sensor systems have attracted significant attention in recent years, a large scale deployment for urban infrastructure monitoring poses many research challenges. One fundamental challenge is dealing with noisy and uncontrolled samples stemming from both noisy sensor measurements and locations, and lack of control on sensor deployment. Such conditions pose difficulties in field estimation and "hot spot" identification from sensor data. My thesis contributions aim to bridge this gap. In this thesis, I designed and developed a mobile sensor system for urban light infrastructure monitoring and studied two problems on field estimation {{in the presence of}} noisy and uncontrolled samples with general implications on mobile sensing. As an example system, I designed and successfully tested a city-wide street light scanning mobile sensor platform. Currently, street light maintenance uses labor-intensive, poorly scalable manual inspection techniques. My system automatically maps street illumination levels and lamp infrastructure. The collected data presents challenges in identifying lamp "hot spots" from false positives and using sensor data from noisy sensor locations for estimating luminosity maps. I present an algorithm for identifying various light sources from video streams and combining that data with location information to geotag lamps. To identity the light sources, I developed a supervised classifier for lamp classification and later extended it to develop a method for estimating the height of the street lamps. As accurate car location information is critical for successful luminosity mapping, I discuss how I improved car location estimates by integrating multiple independent data streams such as vehicle speed data obtained via <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>systems</b> and GPS. Towards such field deployments, one must address fundamental challenges related to both hardware implementation and data analytics. In this thesis, I addressed two problems related to mobile sensor based sampling and signal estimation: nonuniform sampling and errors in sample location. Uniform grid sampling is often impractical in the context of mobile spatial sampling. As an alternative, I studied [delta]-dense sensor arrangements as a realistic scheme for non-uniform flexible sampling. To assess its utility, I derived sufficient conditions for estimating a signal represented in a finite-dimensional basis set and present simulation results on the numerical stability of signal estimation under [delta]-dense sampling. Furthermore, I present the use of proper orthogonal decomposition as a technique to obtain basis sets for signals that are solutions to a parametric differential equation. Finally, I studied how errors in the location measurements of mobile nodes affect the overall signal estimation problem. To address such signal estimation problems, I developed a computationally efficient iterative linear estimator and compared my approach to {{the state of the art}} expectation-maximization technique. I present simulation studies on the performance of the estimator and discuss results on its numerical stability. My approach offers several orders of magnitude reduction in computational time while achieving comparable mean squared estimation error to other techniques making it an appealing candidate for real-time embedded mobile sensing applications. by Sumeet Kumar.
