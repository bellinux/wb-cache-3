5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got <b>one,</b> <b>you</b> began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

Bitches are not pretty....Bitches seek their {{identity}} strictly thru themselves and what they do. They are subjects, not objects...Often they do dominate other people when roles are not available to them which more creatively sublimate their energies and utilize their capabilities. More often they are accused of domineering when doing what would be considered natural by a man.|$|E
25|$|Be {{it known}} unto you that I have {{discovered}} that {{you and the other}} Sir W.

When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you <b>one,</b> <b>you</b> take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
25|$|Santiago de Cali {{is located}} in a valley. The city is {{completely}} bordered by mountains to the West; the Farallones de Cali mountains are the closest to the city. The Eastern part of the city is bordered by the Cauca River. To the north and south are extended plains. In the first <b>one</b> <b>you</b> can find the industrial city of Yumbo which is part of Cali's metropolitan area, to the south you can find Jamundí, also part of the metropolitan area. The city is mainly flat, but there are areas mostly to the west that are mountainous, like San Antonio and La loma de la Cruz, which are both tourist sites.|$|E

25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good <b>one</b> <b>you</b> can find.|$|E

500|$|This {{fractured}} {{approach to}} the writing process began to strain relationships in the band, at one point leading Suptic to consider quitting the band. Pryor drew lyrical inspiration from the lives of friends and people he knew, extracting stories of abuse, betrayal and guilt.

500|$|As {{a further}} {{reference}} to the sentiment regarding friendship expressed in [...] "Isn't It a Pity", the middle section of [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] reflects the influence of Nina Simone's 1972 cover of that earlier song. According to his recollection in I, Me, Mine, Harrison added this section, or coda, when recording [...] "The Answer's at the End". In the lines [...] "And isn't it a pity how / We hurt the ones we love the most of all...", Inglis notes {{the influence of the}} 1944 pop standard [...] "You Always Hurt the <b>One</b> <b>You</b> Love".|$|E

And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. So he just handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which <b>one</b> <b>you</b> like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, British indie band Half Man Half Biscuitperhaps {{best known}} for [...] "The Trumpton Riots" [...] and [...] "Dickie Davies Eyes"included a song {{entitled}} [...] "For What Is Chatteris..."

The song extolled {{the virtues of the}} town, offset against how unsatisfying the best place in the world can suddenly become when the <b>one</b> <b>you</b> love is no longer there: [...] "a market town that lacks quintessence / that's Chatteris without your presence".

50|$|Noise is {{everywhere}} and people {{make it all}} the time. Black argues that econometrics is filled with it in the forms of unobservables and mis-measurement. No matter how many variables one puts into a model, there are always more to add but can't (<b>ones</b> <b>you</b> can't observe) and the <b>ones</b> <b>you</b> have will always have error. This is how noise manifests in econometrics (as well as poor interpretation of regressions, such as assuming correlation means causation).|$|R

In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Charizard was voted as the [...] "best Fire-type Pokémon". They stated, [...] "not only is Charizard your favourite fire Pokémon, but it is probably one of the most popular 'mon of all time". Kotaku editor Patricia Hernandez criticized Charizard's Y Mega Evolution for not differing enough from Charizard's original design, while praising Mega Charizard X for changing color, and turning Charizard into a dragon-type. Game Informer ranked Charizard as the [...] "coolest Pokémon out of the original 151", describing it as [...] "Powerful, gigantic, and imposing".
