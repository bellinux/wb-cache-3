5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins.

5|$|His reward, however, {{was to be}} the university's first Keeper of the Archives, {{appointed}} on 11 August 1634. The new statute {{governing the}} position noted the losses that Oxford had suffered because of the careless keeping of its archives, and the need for an experienced person to take charge of them and to advise the university's officers in defending its interests. He was to be paid not less than £40 annually, with a levy of one shilling from each graduate and undergraduate. Thereafter, he sought to obtain royal confirmation of Oxford's rights and privileges, to keep the city of Oxford subordinate to the university, and to match the position of Cambridge. A new royal charter was obtained in 1636 to confirm the revised statutes. Under Twyne and his successor as Keeper (Gerard Langbaine), the archives were moved into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden presses that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
