5|$|Real maggots {{were used}} during many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes,</b> which were {{described}} by Gillian Anderson {{as being the}} hardest animals to work with on the show. The show's special effects producers were unable to create a full body replica of the first victim in time, requiring him to lay on an autopsy table with makeup applied while the maggots were poured on to him. Rice was used {{in place of the}} maggots during some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes.</b> The car crash {{at the end of the}} entry was described by stunt coordinator Tony Morelli as the most harrowing action sequence during the show's third season. To give the episode a different look the producers applied a green palette to the film in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The first {{adaptation}} of Hellblazer ever filmed for {{the screen is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> in the documentary feature film The Mindscape of Alan Moore, which was shot in early 2002.

5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced {{to ensure that it}} did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E
5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> with Eskimo women when coverage {{was found to be}} lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E

5|$|Critics such as James Berardinelli praised Connery's performance, the femme fatale {{character}} of Fiona Volpe, and the underwater action sequences, remarking {{that they were}} well choreographed and clearly shot. He criticised the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes,</b> however, stating they were in need of editing, particularly during the film's climax. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an 86% rating. In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors, and stunt actors to list their top action films; Thunderball was listed at number 73.|$|E
5|$|Faramir {{appears in}} several {{illustrations}} created by John Howe, Ted Nasmith and Anke Eißmann for The Lord of the Rings and related products. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> {{from the book}} that received many depictions is Faramir and Éowyn's meeting {{at the top of}} Minas Tirith. Eißmann apparently follows the book in presenting Faramir as dark-haired and beardless, also emphasising his recent recovery in the illustration for the dialogue with Éowyn; Nasmith depicts Faramir as bearded and brown-haired.|$|E
5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E

5|$|In late 2007, Fox Atomic {{had plans}} to film Jennifer's Body before a {{possible}} writer's strike. When the Writers Guild of America strike began, shooting was then moved to March 7, 2008, in Burnaby, British Columbia, specifically at Robert Burnaby Park near Cariboo Hill Secondary School. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes,</b> particularly those situated in a school setting, were filmed in local Vancouver-area schools such as Vancouver Technical Secondary School, Langley Secondary School and University Hill Secondary School.|$|E
5|$|Living nativity {{scenes are}} not without their problems. In the United States in 2008, for example, vandals {{destroyed}} all eight scenes and backdrops at a drive-through living nativity scene in Georgia. About 120 of the church’s 500 members {{were involved in the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than US$2,000. Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint.|$|E
30|$|The local {{enhancement}} {{is based}} on a more general retina-like processing scheme previously used in Retiner to extract <b>the</b> main regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and to produce an array of spike events for neural stimulation [11, 12] and in Vis 2 Sound to detect <b>the</b> main objects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> producing a spatialized sound to indicate their location [13]. In this study, this procedure enhances <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> as well as mitigates glares, but we do not perform any kind of sensorial transduction or neural encoding employing its output.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} spot {{metering}} usage {{would be when}} photographing the moon. Due to the very dark nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> other metering methods tend to overexpose the moon. Spot metering will allow for more detail to be brought out in the moon while underexposing <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> More commonly, spot metering is used in theatre photography, where the brightly lit actors stand before a dark or even black curtain or scrim. Spot metering only considers the actors in this case, while ignoring <b>the</b> overall darkness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|R

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> in Southeast Asia {{takes place}} near a karaoke club, and depicts groups of girls, {{apparently}} {{ranging in age}} from early to late teens, offering sexual services to customers. Benjamin Nolot interviews a police officer, who says that the bar's owner recently bought eight other similar clubs and controls around 2,000 girls. Another Southeast Asian scene shows Nolot and his crew chasing an American man out of a town where he was trying to purchase sex with a child.|$|E
5|$|Scorsese {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} {{that among the}} most difficult aspects of the film to represent were the spiritual themes presented in Endo's original book used for the film. The first version of the script he attempted to write with his co-writer Jay Cocks only managed to get midway through the material, before being set aside as insufficiently sensitive to the spiritual aspects of the book. It took Scorsese many years to envision a way to approach an accurate and informed filming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes,</b> involving spiritual transitions among the actors in the film.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Imageworks {{designed}} {{the special effects}} for the film. The digital composition of the film, including the scene where the battle of Spider-Man and Electro in Times Square, took one year to complete. The sets of Times Square were built in Gold Coast Studios with the green screens and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> were digitally re-designed by computer. The photography and VFX team took over 36,000 photos of the Times Square in order to re-create the location digitally. In addition, the animation team captured over 100 billboards during the photography process.|$|E

Due to the filming schedule, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was filmed during the Christmas break. Producers changed the location for <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> from <b>the</b> Los Angeles River as storms occurred before filming.|$|R
