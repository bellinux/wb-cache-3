5|$|The coroner {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and Amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
50|$|Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase is {{an enzyme}} {{part of the}} lignin {{biosynthesis}} pathway. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the enzyme uses sinapaldehyde or coniferyl aldehyde or coumaraldehyde and NADPH to produce sinapyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> coniferyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> coumaryl <b>alcohol</b> respectively and NADP+.|$|R

5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Participants in est {{are told}} that they cannot take notes during the course, {{and at the end}} of the seminar the {{instructor}} declines to go over a review of the training. In order to participate in the course, trainees must adhere to agreements which include: they may not exit the course facility except during specified break time, they cannot sit next to someone they knew before coming to the course, and they cannot take unprescribed medications <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> for the week prior to the training.|$|E
50|$|Coniferyl-alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} uses coniferyl {{alcohol and}} NADP+ to produce coniferyl aldehyde, NADPH, and H+. Coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase uses coniferyl aldehyde, H2O, NAD+, and NADP+ to produce ferulate, NADH, NADPH, and H+. Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase uses sinapaldehyde or coniferyl aldehyde or coumaraldehyde and NADPH to produce sinapyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> coniferyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> coumaryl <b>alcohol</b> respectively and NADP+.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013, Marks & Spencer {{announced}} that Muslim checkout {{staff in the}} UK could refuse to sell pork products <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> to customers at their till. The policy was announced after at least one news outlet reported that customers waiting with goods that included pork <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> were refused service, and were told by a Muslim checkout worker to wait until another till became available. The policy applied across all 703 UK M stores and prompted a strong backlash by customers.|$|E

40|$|A novel type of metal-free {{oxidative}} cross-coupling for {{the synthesis}} of symmetrical and mixed anhydrides from aldehydes <b>or</b> benzylic <b>alcohols</b> has been developed. The aldehydes <b>or</b> <b>alcohols</b> were converted in situ into their corresponding acyl chlorides, which were then reacted {{with an array of}} carboxylic acids. The methodology has a general applicability, and was successfully employed to prepare either aromatic or aliphatic symmetrical anhydrides and mixed anhydrides, which are very unstable compounds...|$|R
50|$|Delirium can {{be caused}} by the {{worsening}} of previous medical conditions, abuse of medications <b>or</b> drugs, <b>alcohol</b> <b>or</b> drug withdrawals, mental illness, severe pain, immobilization, sleep deprivation and hypnosis.|$|R

25|$|The show also {{features}} psychotherapist Graham Stanier, who helps Kyle {{during the show}} and assists guests further after they are on air. Dr. Arun Ghosh also occasionally appears with medical help, often aiding people with drug <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern day}} {{interest}} in absinthe {{has spawned a}} rash of absinthe kits from companies that claim they produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka <b>or</b> <b>alcohol,</b> or adding a liquid concentrate to vodka <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> to create an ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a harsh substance that bears {{little resemblance to the}} genuine article, and are considered inauthentic by any practical standard. Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts. In at least one documented case, a person suffered acute kidney injury after drinking 10ml of pure wormwood oil—a dose much higher than that found in absinthe.|$|E
