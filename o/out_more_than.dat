5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Richard {{threw an}} 11-inning, 10-strikeout {{game against the}} Expos and {{followed}} with two complete games and another nine-inning performance {{in a game that}} went into extra innings. He was selected as the National League Pitcher of the Month after going a perfect 4–0 with a 1.29ERA and 58strikeouts in 56innings during July. Throughout much of August, his season ERA hovered below 3.00, and he averaged well over a strikeout per inning. On August 21, in an 8–3 victory over the Chicago Cubs, he broke Don Wilson's 1969 club record of 235strikeouts. In the final two months of the season, Richard's strikeout average dramatically increased, and he struck out a double-digit number of batters in three of his last five starts. In his third-to-last start, Richard broke Tom Seaver's NL record of 290strikeouts by a right-hander when he struck out Bob Horner. In his final outing of the season, Richard reached the 300-strikeout pinnacle by striking out Rowland Office in a September 28 victory over the Braves. He also hit his seventh career home run, making him the Astros' career leader in home runs by a pitcher. At that time, he became only the tenth pitcher, third National Leaguer and first NL right-hander in history to strike <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 300batters in a single season.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Bonnie produced rainfall up to 4in (100mm) in the Dominican Republic, isolating towns due {{to bridge}} collapses and prompting {{the evacuation of}} thousands of residents. In nearby Puerto Rico, one person drowned in a swollen river. Upon designation, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued along portions of the Florida coastline. Approximately 14,000 Florida customers lost power as Bonnie moved ashore. Minimal tropical storm-force winds affected Virginia Key, where a storm surge of 0.92ft (0.29m) was also reported, and rainfall up to 3.25in (82.6mm) across Miami-Dade County caused urban flooding. Despite degenerating into a remnant low, Bonnie produced more substantial rainfall totals across Louisiana and Mississippi, officially peaking at 5.75in (146mm) in Tylertown. Radar estimates of 8–9in (203–229mm) of rain prompted flash flooding which washed <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 roads and bridges in Washington Parish, while about 110 homes were flooded in West Baton Rouge Parish. Remnant moisture combined with a cold front to produce damaging severe thunderstorms across portions of the Southeast in late July.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{described}} {{the election of}} judges by popular vote as a major goal and supported {{increasing the number of}} judges. He supported giving more authority to law enforcement, including the ability to search people on parole and probation without warrant, making attempted murder a crime with lifelong sentence, and increasing penalties for possession of illegal guns. Ford is a proponent of stricter regulations of the financial industry. He sponsored a 2006 ban on payday lending, which was shown to discriminate against African Americans. In 2008, Ford blocked all House bills in the Senate until the bill was taken up. The bill failed in the Senate by a close vote and was heavily amended so lenders would not be banned but restricted. The bill then passed with Ford voting in favor but failed to advance after changes made in the House. A bill preventing consumers from taking <b>out</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one loan at a time passed the House in 2009. Ford supported offshore drilling, stating conservation was not a priority for most citizens of the state. Geologists believe there is little oil to be found off the South Carolina coast. Ford wants to prevent the widening of Interstate 26 through Charleston, calling instead for a study for transportation needs. Ford emphasized the need for more funding for school programs, which he claimed is necessary due to the small number of pupils attending college and to remedy lacks of knowledge in geography and civics, which he wants reinstated as a school subject. Ford was told about favoritism, intimidation and racism in the South Carolina Highway Patrol and publicized it with Glenn McConnell. Subsequently, director and deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety resigned under pressure from governor Mark Sanford.|$|E
