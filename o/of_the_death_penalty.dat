50|$|The High Court, which functioned until 1949, judged 108 cases; it {{pronounced}} eight <b>death</b> <b>penalties,</b> {{including one}} for an elderly Pétain, whose appeal failed.

50|$|The last non-military {{execution}} in Mexico was in 1937, {{and the last}} military execution (of a soldier charged with insubordination and murder) was in 1961, so <b>the</b> official abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in 2005 and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in 1976 lagged the de facto cessations by 68 and 15 years, respectively.|$|R
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the death penalty in all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Spain; {{following}} the death of Francisco Franco, two months later, no further executions took place.

In 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used to convict two of those executed had violated their rights and awarded compensation to their families.|$|E
5|$|A congratulatory {{telegram}} to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January {{prompted a}} storm of anti-Boer and anti-German feeling in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of £25,000 each.|$|E

5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E

According to an expert in Peruvian law, the confession fit a defense strategy {{of trying to get}} the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery.

5|$|In March, {{hundreds}} {{of political prisoners}} were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming {{that there were no}} further political prisoners in Libya.

Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive.

5|$|None of the Commission's {{recommendations}} {{ever made}} it into law under the Rump Parliament, though the Commission did produce 16 bills. Several were read in the House of Commons, and the remainder given to the Parliamentary Law Committee in July 1652 following the Committee's dissolution on 23 July. The Rump Parliament's successor, the Barebone's Parliament, brought two of the Commission's suggestions (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) into force through statutes. Most of the Commission's suggestions were, at some point, followed. In 1837 the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was curtailed, and it was finally abolished in 1969. From 1702 onwards, witnesses were allowed for the defence, and the Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836 allowed legal representation for the defendants. The use of peine forte et dure was abolished in 1741, and the benefit of clergy in 1827. A permanent Law Commission was finally established with the Law Commissions Act 1965. County Courts were finally established in 1846, and a Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation. Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E
5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E

5|$|From the {{founding}} of modern Singapore in 1819 until 1826, Singapore was headed by two Residents in succession. Following Singapore's amalgamation into the Straits Settlements in 1826, it was governed by a Governor together with a Legislative Council. An Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor but wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, appointed by the Governor {{on the recommendation of}} the Leader of the House. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965. The PAP has been returned to power in every general election and has thus formed the Cabinet since 1959. The Government is generally perceived to be competent in managing the country's economy and largely free from political corruption. On the other hand, it has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, violating freedom of speech and its excessive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> (by hanging) for non-violent crimes.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty)</b> to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Soviet was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E
