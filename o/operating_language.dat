5000|$|The {{importance}} of English as {{the language of}} global commerce has led many non-English companies, including Finland's Nokia, to adopt English as their official <b>operating</b> <b>language.</b> Recently, {{it has been observed}} that English borrowings are also ousting previous borrowings, for example the switch from treffailla [...] "to date" [...] (from Swedish, träffa) to deittailla from English [...] "to go for a date". Calques from English are also found, e.g. kovalevy (hard disk). Grammatical calques are also found, for example, the replacement of the impersonal (passiivi) with the English-style generic you, e. g. sä et voi [...] "you cannot", instead of ei voi [...] "one cannot". This construct, however, is limited to colloquial language, as it is against the standard grammar.|$|E

50|$|Louis {{preserved}} {{the freedom of}} worship of the Calvinists, {{the right of the}} estates to negotiate their taxes and the obligation of the king of France to swear to uphold the customary law of Béarn on his accession. He also united Béarn and Navarre: thenceforth the Parlement of Navarre and Béarn had authority over both regions and would sit at Pau. Its <b>operating</b> <b>language</b> would be French. This {{was the first time the}} French language was imposed on a region incorporated into France. It was not part of an effort to convert the French king's Occitan subjects into French speakers, nor did it directly impact the Bearnese aristocracy, who had adopted French as a status language during the 16th century. It was politically symbolic, since the use of Occitan in an official capacity had been an important marker of Bearnese independence and a source of pride.|$|E
50|$|In 395, {{the army}} used Latin as its <b>operating</b> <b>language.</b> This {{continued}} {{to be the case}} into the late 6th century, despite the fact that Greek was the common language of the Eastern empire. This was not simply due to tradition, but also to the fact that about half the Eastern army {{continued to be}} recruited in the Latin-speaking Danubian regions of the Eastern empire. An analysis of known origins of comitatenses in the period 350-476 shows that in the Eastern army, the Danubian regions provided 54% of the total sample, despite constituting just 2 of the 7 eastern dioceses (administrative divisions): Dacia and Thracia. These regions continued to be the prime recruiting grounds for the East Roman army e.g. the emperor Justin I (r. 518-27), uncle of Justinian I, was a Latin-speaking peasant who never learnt to speak more than rudimentary Greek. The Romanized Thracian (Thraco-Roman) and Illyrian inhabitants of those regions, who {{came to be known as}} Vlachs by foreigners in the Middle Ages, retained the Roman name (Romanians) and the Latin tongue.|$|E

Two fundamental issues are: can we design more operations in addition to existing operations? and, how many operations are sufficient or necessary? This paper solves these problems by investigating the theoretical basis for determining how complete a selection capability is provided in a resource operation sublanguage independent of any host language.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{language}} resources accessible on the Internet increases, many efforts have been made for combining language resources and language processing tools to create new services. However, existing language resource coordination frameworks cannot manage issues of intellectual property associated with language resources, which {{make it difficult for}} most end-users to get supports for their intercultural collaborations because they always {{have to deal with the}} issues by themselves. In this paper, we aim at constructing a new language service management architecture on the Language Grid, which enables language resource providers to control access to their resources in accordance with their own policies. Furthermore, we apply the proposed architecture to the <b>operating</b> <b>Language</b> Grid in order to validate the effectiveness of the architecture. As a result, several service management models utilizing the monitoring and access constraints are occurring to satisfy various requirements from language resource providers. These models can handle paid-for language resources as well as free language resources. Finally, we discuss further challenging issues of combining language resources under each different policies. 1...|$|E

40|$|Excellent {{graphics}} are {{the instruments}} used for representing quantitative information. Graphics help {{people to understand}} complex things easily. Hence the user interfaces developed should be clear, illustrative and designed from the user point of view {{with respect to their}} applications. The thesis work deals with the design of a graphical user interface (GUI) developed for a home energy monitoring system. Design methodologies like user centric design and empathic design are followed while creating the user interface and also the effect of various colors on human perception is studied. Hence the final design of user interface provides the end-users a visualization of the energy produced and consumed in a monitored environment. The monitoring devices are connected to ThereGate system (data logger) via the M-Bus communication protocol. The ThereGate platform uses an Open Source Linux system as the <b>operating</b> <b>language.</b> The other communication platform used over the ThereGate platform is an oBIX bridge, a web based service interface rich in XML support for transferring the data. The interface has been programmed by using Visual basics 2008 and VB. NET, developed by Microsoft. The work progresses with an initial explanation on the availability of various home energy monitoring systems on the market and their comparison. The other units discuss the architecture of the ThereGate system, give a brief overview of the M-bus system, and discuss the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from a user centric design perspective using Microsoft's Visual Basics and VB. NET and configuration of M-Bus. The last unit contains a discussion of the goals achieved {{at the end of the}} design and the future developments that can be made to have more user interactions with the user interface...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} how {{the artificial}} symbolic language LoCoS {{in comparison to}} a natural foreign language is suited for the application in international human-computer communication. Not considered are the spoken aspect of the language (pronunciation) or the use as <b>operating</b> <b>language</b> in human-computer interaction. LoCoS is examined {{with regard to the}} criteria effectivity, efficiency, acceptance, learnability, encoding and functionality. The ad-hoc sample yielded 47 persons from 19 different countries totally from all over the world. The subjects were allocated to 3 groups, namely: the control group C English and the experimental groups E 1 Englisch with Smileys and E 2 LoCoS. The test for acquisition of the objective and subjective data was conducted through the onlineportal My LoCoS Community. The first part of the test consisted of the verbalization of 10 given sentences with the aid of (C) the English language, (E 1) the English language in combination with emoticons and (E 2) the symbolic language LoCoS. The second part contained a survey which the subjects were asked to participate in. Summarizing the results, a restraint acceptance of LoCoS as a symbolic language was found out, although the learning effort compared to natural foreign languages was rated notably less. Nevertheless, a general trend to extended natural languages could be detected. Furthermore, it was found out, that LoCoS is equally suitable for use in Human-Computer Communication as natural languages since communication of complex contents is possible. A less average error rate could only be stated in 4 of 10 cases. Yet, communication occurs more efficiently, because less symbols than words are used to express the same thought. In the end, symbolic languages depend on natural distribution by scientists, business and private people - a process, which decides more than theoretical quality criteria alone over the success of an artificially created language...|$|E
