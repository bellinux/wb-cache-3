5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister and director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Hofoper. Complaints {{were made in}} the Berlin press about the delay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the {{executive}} committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> city council proposed a site {{on the banks of}} the river Spree, roughly corresponding to the current location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Finance Department and the offices of the Social Association of Germany. The proposal was rejected by the full city council because it would overshadow the city hall. Further proposals were put on hold for several years. After discussing many locations, in 1898, chief of construction Ludwig Hoffmann became involved and the council agreed on Molkenmarkt. The 32 built-up parcels of land on the site were bought up and cleared.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as his successes in Paris, Meyerbeer, as a Prussian Court Kapellmeister (Director of Music) from 1832, and from 1843 as Prussian General Music Director, was also {{influential}} in opera in Berlin and throughout Germany.

He was commissioned to write the patriotic opera Ein Feldlager in Schlesien to celebrate the reopening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Berlin</b> Royal Opera House in 1844 and wrote music for certain Prussian state occasions.|$|E
