50|$|Semtex {{was very}} similar to <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> explosives, {{especially}} C-4, in being highly malleable; but it is usable over a greater temperature range than <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> explosives, since it stays plastic between −40 and +60 °C. It is also waterproof. There are visual differences between Semtex and <b>other</b> <b>plastic</b> explosives, too: while C-4 is off-white in colour, Semtex is red or brick-orange.|$|R

25|$|PMMA swells and dissolves in many organic solvents; it {{also has}} poor {{resistance}} to many other chemicals due to its easily hydrolyzed ester groups. Nevertheless, its environmental stability is superior to most <b>other</b> <b>plastics</b> such as polystyrene and polyethylene, and PMMA is therefore often the material of choice for outdoor applications.|$|E
25|$|EVOH {{is used in}} {{multilayer}} {{films for}} packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must {{be used as a}} core layer surrounded by <b>other</b> <b>plastics</b> (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and noise protection walls.|$|E
25|$|In 1820, Samuel Stockton, a {{goldsmith}} by trade, began manufacturing high-quality porcelain dentures {{mounted on}} 18-carat gold plates. Later dentures from the 1850s on {{were made of}} Vulcanite, a form of hardened rubber into which porcelain teeth were set. In the 20th century, acrylic resin and <b>other</b> <b>plastics</b> were used. In Britain, sequential Adult Dental Health Surveys revealed that in 1968 79% of those aged 65–74 had no natural teeth; by 1998, this proportion had fallen to 36%.|$|E

25|$|A 2009 {{study found}} that {{drinking}} from polycarbonate bottles increased urinary bisphenolA levels by two thirds, from 1.2 μg/g creatinine to 2 μg/g creatinine. Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenolA avoid canned food and polycarbonate plastic containers (which shares resin identification code 7 with many <b>other</b> <b>plastics)</b> unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenolA-free. To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E
25|$|Many sculptors seek {{new ways}} and {{materials}} to make art. One of Pablo Picasso's most famous sculptures included bicycle parts. Alexander Calder and other modernists made spectacular use of painted steel. Since the 1960s, acrylics and <b>other</b> <b>plastics</b> {{have been used}} as well. Andy Goldsworthy makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as ice sculpture, sand sculpture, and gas sculpture, is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used stained glass, tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use found objects, and Chinese scholar's rocks have been appreciated for many centuries.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{products}} are printed with numbers 1–7 {{depending on the}} type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all <b>other</b> <b>plastics</b> such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E
