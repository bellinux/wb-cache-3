40|$|We have {{performed}} a historical research, {{trying to establish}} the auditing conditions, in terms of adjustments over time. Our purpose with this essay was to demonstrate the facts behind <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditor, and hopefully give the reader some new information. Our questions at issue were: What in the debate, regarding <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditor, in concern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandals,</b> is most relevant each decade? Witch aftermath has influenced the regulation regarding <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditor? What we thought {{was the best way}} to answer this question was to study a large amount of journals according to the current decade, since 1930 and forward. The journals presented different persons opinions regarding <b>the</b> <b>scandals,</b> and we used them as an instrument to analyse the regulations and after-effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandals.</b> Our conclusion is that in purpose to make the auditor independent, the debate among competent and well-informed people in <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> business has, through the decades, frequently recurred to strive towards a more homogenous auditing...|$|R
5|$|In comparison, 2008 Presidential {{candidate}} Hillary Clinton {{began to}} disengage from Hsu {{at an earlier}} phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal</b> when Hsu's long time fugitive status was first revealed.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat {{on the first day}} of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} the Metro Council Rules Committee {{delivered}} in March stated that the granite's origin was discovered in early 1988, and was authorized by tunnel superintendent David Kalberer {{with the assumption that}} only a small amount would be used to furnish University Street station. Kalberer, who received praise for his work on the project before the scandal, admitted that the failure to consult the Metro Council's tunnel subcommittee before signing off on the deal was his mistake. Metro Director Alan Gibbs resigned on February 23 as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal</b> and was succeeded by technical director Richard Sandaas in September. The granite was rejected by Metro and was returned to the supplier in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Televised {{hearings}} in early 1957 exposed misconduct {{by both the}} Beck and the Hoffa factions of the Teamsters Union.

In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The foreign press {{suggested}} that Albert Victor was sent on a seven-month tour of British India from October 1889 {{to avoid the}} gossip which swept London society in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal.</b> This is not true; the trip had actually been planned since the spring. Travelling via Athens, Port Said, Cairo and Aden, Albert Victor arrived in Bombay on 9 November 1889. He was entertained sumptuously in Hyderabad by the Nizam, and elsewhere by many other maharajahs. He spent Christmas at Mandalay and the New Year at Calcutta. Most of the extensive travelling was done by train, although elephants were ridden as part of ceremonies. In {{the style of the}} time, a great many animals were shot for sport.|$|E

5|$|Thompson still {{wished to}} leave Alaska, however, and in 1915, he sold a {{majority}} share of News-Miner stock on option to O.P. Gaustad, a Republican Party booster. Scandal erupted {{when it was}} revealed that Gaustad was merely a stand-in for James Wickersham, who was Alaska's delegate to Congress. Partially because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> Gaustad was unable to sell the shares he held an option for, and Thompson returned to Alaska in spring 1916 to reassume his role as publisher. Later that year, Republican interests took over the Fairbanks Times, which had leaned toward the Democratic Party. The new owners of the Times were unable to come up with financing for new equipment, however, and the Times went out of business in October 1916.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Dow won {{a special}} {{election}} to the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican {{when one of the}} members elected declined to serve. He won reelection to a full term in 1859, and continued to agitate for stricter prohibition laws, but was unsuccessful. He also became entangled in scandal when the State Treasurer, Benjamin D. Peck, lent out state funds to private citizens (including Dow) contravening state law. Peck lent large sums to himself, which were lost when his business ventures failed. Dow had guaranteed some of Peck's borrowing, and faced ruin as it became clear that Peck could not repay the state treasury. Dow was able to settle the debts and conceal much of his role in the affair, but enough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal</b> became known that some of his many enemies attacked him in local newspapers. Even some of his prohibitionist allies became less openly supportive of him. In September 1860, he did not run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E

5|$|On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, {{was indicted}} for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was {{appointed}} to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county's Fiscal Court authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley's surety bond. In May 1909, Smedley {{was arrested and charged}} with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county's finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley's opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county's entire Democratic organization was corrupt and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he had no more responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of William Goebel, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. He pointed to his improvement of the county's finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scandal,</b> Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, but Republicans captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.|$|E
