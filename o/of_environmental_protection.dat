5|$|In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut {{discovered}} {{a photo of}} the light and began to research its history. Joel Severance, chairman of the harbor commission, wanted to build a 28-foot (8.5 meter) tall replica that would primarily function as a daymark and their plan was endorsed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in the United States Coast Guard and both the town of Deep River and Middlesex County, Connecticut, but it was expected to be denied by the Connecticut Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection.</b> In 2000, the plan was rejected by the Connecticut Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 2010 deputy-minister <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Bogdan Presner {{was sacked}} for {{accepting}} a bribe of $200,000 (he {{was sentenced to}} nine years in prison in October 2011). On June 17, 2010 Minister on Communal Living Oleksandr Popov (Party of Regions) was replaced by Yuriy Hivrich.|$|E
5|$|According to the New Jersey Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> (NJDEP), two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershedâ€”Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek. The phosphorus loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns, nearby agricultural operations, or from large populations of geese that inhabit the lakes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} that Ransom Township, Newton Township, {{and the city}} of Scranton include protection of Keyser Creek in their comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances for land use, zoning, and subdivision. The creek is on the Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation's priority list and the Lackawanna River Corridor Association's priority list for the Lackawanna River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery, as is its tributary Negro Hollow. Both Messers Run (from Lofty Reservoir downstream to Blue Head Reservoir) and Negro Hollow (between its headwaters and its mouth) are also considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters. A 1997 report advised against stocking Messers Run.|$|E
5|$|Nanticoke Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> to be impaired, meaning that it fails to attain water quality standards. The causes of impairment are metals and pH and the probable source is abandoned mine drainage. The creek is also impacted by abandoned mine lands in its watershed. However, a total maximum daily load is not planned. The {{upper reaches of the}} creek do not experience any major pollution.|$|E

5|$|The Forrest H. Duttlinger Natural Area {{is located}} on Hammersley Fork. Most of the stream flows through this natural area. It is a 1521-acre area that {{includes}} a 158-acre area of old-growth hemlock trees. The Hammersley Wild Area is also located in the watershed. The stream's watershed is a Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory Biological Diversity Area. The Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> also classifies the watershed as an exceptional-value area.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek, {{including all}} of the streams and wetlands, has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in the area. The natural surface water hydrology of the watershed was substantially modified by projects of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> from the 1950s until the 1990s. The sediment retention structure in The Hollow was constructed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek has a {{watershed}} association {{known as the}} Abrahams Creek Watershed Association. It was awarded the Watershed Stewardship Award by the Luzerne Conservation District in 2009. The organization also received a $5000 grand from American Water for improving water quality, adding riparian buffers, and other projects. Damaging flooding in 2006 caused the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization to be created. The creek {{was used as a}} reference watershed by the Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> when developing a total maximum daily load for the nearby Solomon Creek.|$|E

5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} the subject of {{scientific}} studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems. It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that the lake was eutrophic. Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{in order}} to add four {{additional}} Amtrak trips along the corridor, four of the then six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> limits service over the Old Saybrook-Old Lyme bridge {{in order to}} avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. ConnDOT's agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes to board the selected Amtrak trains as well.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> to be impaired by siltation. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Trimmers Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The main soils include the Berks-Weikert-Alvira series, the Chenango-Pope-Holly series, the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich series, and the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. Most of the watershed is forested or agricultural land, {{but there is some}} developed land.|$|E

5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|The dam catalyzed {{improved}} upstream {{wastewater treatment}} around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection,</b> as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every day. Over onebillion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which {{was more likely to}} be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{drainage}} basin of Scotch Run is {{designated by the}} Pennsylvania Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has stocked it with adult trout. The Black Creek Sportsmens Club and the Beaver Township Rod and Gun Club also stock the stream with trout. A 1997 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission discovered a small population of wild brook trout and hatchery brook trout in the stream.|$|E
