40|$|We have {{compiled}} petrological and geochemical {{data from}} 71 <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suites</b> and greenstone belts, which {{range in age}} from 15 to 3760 Ma. We have selected those rocks whose compositions indicate that they are either normal mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) or hotspot-type MORBs. Then we used the data base to calculate the most primitive liquidus temperature for each rock suite. The results show that the liquidus temperature of the Phanerozoic ophiolites ranges from a low of 1212 °C to a high of 1417 °C. Using these data and two exponential curves bracketing the maximum and minimum temperatures versus time, we infer that the Phanerozoic suites had a mean liquidus temperature of 1272 ± 7 °C and a mean temperature range of 1218 ° to 1425 °C. The liquidus temperatures of Archean MORBlike greenstones range from 1305 ° to 1576 °C. Using these data and two exponential curves bracketing the maximum and minimum temperatures versus time, we infer that Archean melts at 2. 8 Ga had a mean liquidus temperature of 1399 ± 13 °C and a temperature range from 1301 ° to 1533 °C. Using two different methods, we show that the change in the mean liquidus temperature since the late Archean is from 96 ± 13 °C (from temperature ranges) to 127 ± 20 °C (from temperature means). When we convert these liquidus temperatures to potential temperature of the mantle, we find that the change in the mean upper mantle potential temperature since the late Archean is from 137 ± 8 °C (from temperature ranges) to 187 ± 42 °C (from temperature means). This change is less than that which was previously thought to have occurred. We compared the liquidus temperatures calculated from our data set with an independent data set from the modern day Pacific plate. The resulting histograms have the same shape and the same temperature range, showing that our method for calculating mantle temperatures from MORBlike rocks in <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suites</b> is valid. When our calculated liquidus temperatures for all time intervals are plotted in histograms, the resulting distributions are not bimodal, but skewed unimodal. That is, the distributions show a high-T tail which results from the presence of hotspot magmas in the data set. The Archean temperature distribution is also skewed unimodal, and the high-temperature Archean rocks, such as komatiites, plot in the hotspot area of the distribution. This strongly supports the contention that komatiites do not represent “normal” Archean mantle but rather were probably erupted by hotspots.

Field and chemical data indicate that the <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite</b> was produced through fractional crystallization of a single parent magma with a hiatus between the formation of the ultramafic-gabbro sequence and that of the sheeted dyke-pillow lava assemblage.

40|$|The Bay of Islands Complex, {{situated}} {{on the west coast}} of Newfoundland, forms the upper slice assemblage of a number of allochthonous slices that were emplaced on platformal carbonate rocks of the ancient North American continental margin during the lower Middle Ordovician. The Complex consists of a complete ophiolite sequence disposed in four main massifs and believed to represent obducted portions of oceanic lithosphere. During early stages of displacement from the oceanic environment, a basal dynamothermal aureole was developed and remains part of the Complex. Temperatures of metamorphism in this aureole suggest that the ophiolitic rocks were just formed and still hot when displaced. This, together with other evidence, suggests their production in a marginal basin or in the environs of a ridge, subduction zone, transform triple point. [...] Petrological, mineralogical and chemical data show that the Complex may be divided into a lower series of ultramafic tectonites representing mantle material, and a higher series of cumulate and extrusive rocks capped by clastic sediments which may be correlated with oceanic crust. [...] Examination of the tectonite series reveals a lower spinel lherzolite member overlain by harzburgites. Both rock types are cut by numerous deformed and undeformed olivine-pyroxene veins. These veins represent early crystallisation products from a picritic tholeiite magma derived at 18 kb and 1100 °C by ~ 23 % partial melting of a spinel lherzolite to leave a harzburgite residuum. The remainder of the magma crystallised as different cumulate and extrusive rocks under crustal conditions. [...] The petrogenetic model derived from the mineralogy and chemistry implies a rising diapiric body beneath an accreting centre and allows for the production of tholeiitic, transitional and mildly alkaline basalts from a similar parent. The nature of the basalt erupted depends upon rate of upwelling and rate of crysallisation within the diapir. Prolonged fractionation at pressures of 8 - 18 kb may explain the derivation of off ridge-axis alkaline series. Furthermore, the model places limits on the depths of melting within the rising diapir and suggests that crystallisation takes place at depths of less than approximately 60 km.

Samples with low ? 18 O show no indication of contamination by oceanic crust such as elevated Cl/K, and are too deep to {{have been influenced by}} meteoric water hydrothermal systems. They cannot represent Icelandic melts contaminated in the crust and transferred laterally along the ridge since fissure systems are strongly oblique to the ridge axis. It follows that Icelandic mantle advected along the ridge has low ? 18 O. The hyperbolic 143 Nd/ 144 Nd–? 18 O correlation appears to be more strongly curved than magma mixing trajectories and suggests that melt fractions are 4. 5 × greater and source Nd contents 9 × greater in the mantle at 63 °N compared with that at 60 °N. Primitive lavas from the Reykjanes Peninsula show linear correlations between olivine ? 18 O and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd or 206 Pb/ 204 Pb, extending to ? 18 O of + 4. 3 ‰ at 143 Nd/ 144 Nd close to the lowest ratios observed in Icelandic magmas. These correlations cannot be produced by melt mixing or crustal contamination because these would yield strongly hyperbolic trajectories. Lower ? 18 O seen in more evolved samples from the Eastern Rift Zone may reflect crustal contamination, though there is some evidence of a mantle source with lower ? 18 O in eastern Iceland. It is very difficult to explain the low ? 18 O of enriched Icelandic mantle sources on current understanding of mantle and crustal oxygen isotopes. There is no obvious reason why such low-? 18 O sources should not contribute to other ocean islands. No oceanic crustal lithologies exist that could produce the low-? 18 O enriched sources by recycling into the mantle, and there is no evidence for changes in ? 18 O of <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suites</b> with time, nor of changes during high-P metamorphism.

These basalts are well exposed all along the east coast of southern part of the south AOS. Although these basalts are altered due to low-grade metamorphism and late hydrothermal processes, their igneous textures are still preserved. These basalts are mostly either aphyric or phyric in nature. Aphyric type exhibits intersertal or variolitic textures, whereas phyric variety shows porphyritic or sub-ophitic textures. The content of alkalies and silica classify these basalts as sub-alkaline basalts and alkaline basalts. A few samples show basaltic andesite, trachy-basalt, or basanitic chemical composition. High-field strength element (HFSE) geochemistry sug-gests that studied basalt samples are probably derived from similar parental magmas. Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and CaO/TiO 2 ratios classify these basalts as high-Ti type basalt.

The two tectonic terranes are bounded by the Batui Thrust and Balantak Fault System, which {{are considered to be}} the surface expression of the collision zone between the Banggai-Sula Platform and the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite Belt. The collision complex contains three distinctive sedimentary sequences : 1) Triassic-Palaeogene {{continental margin}} sediments, ii) Cretaceous pelagic sediments and iii) Neogene coarse clastic sediments and volcanogenic turbidites. (i) Late Triassic Lemo Beds consisting largely of carbonate-slope deposits and subsidiary clastics including quartz-rich lithic sandstones and lensoidal pebbly mudstone and conglomeratic breccia. The hemipelagic limestones are rich in micro-fossils. Some beds of the limestone contain bivalves and ammonites, including Misolia, which typifies the Triassic-Jurassic sequence of eastern Indonesia. The Jurassic Kapali Beds are dominated by quartzose arenites containing significant amounts of plant remains and lumps of coal. The Late Jurassic sediments consist of neritic carbonate deposits (Nambo Beds and Sinsidik Beds) containing ammonites and belemnites, including Belemnopsis uhligi Stevens, of Late Jurassic age. The Jurassic sediments are overlain unconformably by Late Cretaceous Luok Beds which are predominantly calcilutite with chert nodules rich in microfossils. The Luok Beds are unconformably overlain by the Palaeogene Salodik Limestones which consist of carbonate platform sediments rich in both benthic and planktonic foraminifera of Eocene to Early Miocene age. These sediments were deposited on the continental margin of the Banggai-Sula Platform. (ii) Deep-sea sediments (Boba Beds) consist largely of chert and subsidiary calcilutite rich in radiolaria of Cretaceous age. These rocks are part of an <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite.</b> (iii) Coarse clastic sediments (Kolo Beds and Biak Conglomerates) are typical post-orogenic clastic rocks deposited on top of the collision complex.

An olivine-clinopyroxene dominated transitional peridotite {{along the western}} margin of the mass has more Fe-rich silicates than in the harzburgitic suite. Fe-Mg silicate-spinel relationships and the distribu-tion of AJ between coexisting pyroxenes and spinel indicate nearly complete post-layering equilibration. A partial re-equilibration is suggested by narrow compositional rims on pyroxenes and spinel. Relative to the mineral cores, the rims show enhanced partitioning of Al into spinel relative to pyroxene. The Fe-Mg relationships between silicates and spinel, and the compositional variations from cores to rims of pyroxenes and spinels indicate that the rims formed at lower temperatures than the mineral cores. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} application of several geothermometers, which give average temperatures of equilibra-tion and partial re-equilibration of 1000 - 1070 °C and 920 - 1030 °C, respectively. Pyroxene overgrowths on olivine probably represent pre-equilibration cooling phenomena. Equilibra-tion pressures cannot be estimated with precision because Red Mountain pyroxenes have Al contents that vary as a function of whole-rock AI 2 O 3, and other compositional variables, as well as of T and P of equilibration. The lack of plagioclase in the harzburgite tectonites, and the wide range of (Al/Cr) Ipinei indicate equilibration at fairly high pressures, probably at depths within the 25 - 80 km range.

This shear zone may have connected with low-angle normal faults in its upper levels, because {{it is probable that}} its later history involved the metamorphic complexes being dragged out from under a stretching and fracturing upper plate composed mainly of unmetamorphosed sedimentary and <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite</b> rocks. This model can be extended to explain the exhumation of the high-pressure–low-temperature metamorphic rocks on Crete, which, with the Cyclades, forms a distended paired metamorphic belt separated by an active sedimentary basin...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The Ankara Melange {{consists}} {{from west}} to east of three major parallel belts: (i) metamorphic melange, (ii) limestone melange and (iii) ophiolitic melange. A Triassic age for the metamorphic and limestone belts and a Cretaceous age for the ophiolitic belt have been suggested by several authors (Norman 1973, ~apan 1981, Yilmazer 1981). The ophiolitic belt includes lenses of serpentinite, occasionally unserpentinized perido-tite, gabbro, pillow lava, agglomerate and basic dykes. The ultrabasic rocks show tectonic fabrics and the gabbros cumulate textures. The metamorphic and limestone melange belts contain basic volcanic rocks only as blocks, clasts and dykes, and are devoid of ultrabasic rocks. Petrochemical studies reveal that the volcanic rocks of the ophiolitic and metamorphic belts are very similar in mineralogical and chemical composition, including representatives of both the tholeiitic and calc-alkaline s ries. The presence of almost {{all the members of}} an <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite</b> may indicate an ocean floor origin for the ultrabasic and basic rocks of the ophiolitic melange belt, and the occurrenc...|$|E
40|$|In the East Nelson area, ophiolitic {{rocks of}} the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt (East Nelson ophiolites) have been {{described}} by past workers as representing either a single disrupted <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite</b> or a number of distinct ophiolite suites. [...] Through geochemical evaluation of mafic rocks of the East Nelson ophiolites, it has been determined that potentially three separate ophiolite suites exist; the Dun Mountain Ophiolite, the Patuki mélange and the Croisilles mélange. [...] The Dun Mountain Ophiolite represents a semi-complete <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite.</b> Geochemical evidence indicates that mafic rocks of this ophiolite are of island-arc tholeiite composition and have been produced by partial melting of depleted mantle above a subduction zone. The disrupted and relatively incomplete nature of the ophiolite {{is considered to be}} the result of tectonic activity associated with obduction and later orogenesis. [...] Unconformably overlying the Dun Mountain Ophiolite are local accumulations of conglomeratic material, known as the Upukerora Formation. Clasts within this formation closely resemble lithologies observed within the Dun Mountain Ophiolite and pyroxenes analyzed from clasts are found to be compositionally similar to those observed within the ophiolite. [...] Rocks of the Patuki and Croisilles mélanges lie in fault contact with, and underlie the Dun Mountain Ophiolite. Blocks within the mélanges consist of sedimentary, mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks suspended in matrices dominated by sheared serpentinite. Although these rocks are highly disrupted, they are considered to represent vestiges of true ophiolitic assemblages, as representative lithologies of an ophiolite are observed within the blocks. These rocks likely represent fragments of oceanic crust subducted beneath the Dun Mountain Ophiolite. [...] Basaltic rocks of the Fatuki and Croisilles mélanges are divided into two petrographically and geochemically defined suites; a mid-ocean ridge suite and an alkaline within-plate suite. Geochemical evidence suggests mid-ocean ridge basalts of the mélanges are indistinguishable and therefore it is suggested that the mélanges may represent dislocated portions of the same oceanic basement. [...] A fore-arc environment of formation is favoured for the origin of the Dun Mountain Ophiolite. By this model the Patuki and Croisilles mélanges are considered fragments of normal ocean crusts sheared off the subducted slab during subduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{incomplete}} Evros ophiolites in NE Greece form a NE−SW-oriented discontinuous belt in the Alpine orogen of {{the north}} Aegean. Field data, petrology and geochemistry are presented here for the intrusive section and associated mafic dykes of these ophiolites. Bodies of high-level isotropic gabbro and plagiogranite in the <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite</b> are cross-cut by NE–SW-trending boninitic and tholeiitic–boninitic affinity dykes, respectively. The dykes fill tensile fractures or faults, which implies dyke emplacement in an extensional tectonic regime. The tholeiitic–transitional boninitic gabbro is REE- and HFS-depleted relative to N-MORB, indicating derivation from melting of a refractory mantle peridotite source. Associated boninitic dykes are slightly LREE-enriched, showing mineral and whole-rock geochemistry similar to the gabbro. The plagiogranite is a strongly REE-enriched high-silica trondhjemite, with textures and composition typical for an oceanic crust differentiate. Plagiogranite-hosted tholeiitic and transitional boninitic dykes are variably REE-enriched. Geochemical modelling indicates origin of the plagiogranite by up to 75 % fractional crystallization of basaltic magma similar to that producing the associated tholeiitic dykes. All mafic rocks have high LILE/HFSE ratios and negative Ta–Nb–Ti and Ce anomalies, typical for subduction zone-related settings. The mafic rocks show a similar trace-element character to the mafic lavas of an extrusive section in Bulgaria, suggestin...|$|E
40|$|Pillow metabasalts and {{interbedded}} slates {{adjacent to}} the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone (LOFZ) of the southern Chilean Andes have been studied using electron-microprobe mineral analysis, major and trace element whole-rock geochemistry and RbSr geochronology. The rocks show previously unrecognized mineralogical evidence of two metamorphic events in a low-pressure environment: an early greenschist-facies metamorphism, possibly during emplacement on the sea-floor, and a patchy amphibolite-facies overprint, which could represent either continuing sea-floor metamorphism or contact metamorphism associated with Miocene plutons. The meta-igneous rocks are considered to have formed from mid-Tertiary basaltic magmas with mixed within-plate/volcanic arc characteristics as seen in present-day volcanoes in the area, but enriched in immobile elements such as Ti, Zr, And Y. They were probably emplaced between 45 and 20 Ma, into a contemporaneous marine pull-apart or extensional basin with thin continental or oceanic floor. Many of the petrological and geochemical features of an <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite</b> may be recognized in the immediate area. A chain of such basins developed immediately west of the LOFZ strike slip system, probably during an Eocene- Early Miocene period of oblique subduction-convergence in southern Chile, and closed when the approach angle became more orthogonal 25 Ma. Magmatic arc plutonism was resumed at about 20 Ma and continued into the latest Cenozoic...|$|E
40|$|Archean mafic and ultramafic rocks {{occur in}} the southeastern Wind River Mountains near Atlantic City, Wyoming and are {{interpreted}} to represent a dismembered <b>ophiolite</b> <b>suite.</b> The ophiolitic rocks occur in a thin belt intruded by the 2. 6 Ga Louis Lake Batholith on the northwest. On the southeast they are in fault contact with the Miners Delight Formation comprised primarily of metagraywackes with minor calc-alkaline volcanics. The ophiolitic and associated metasedimentry rocks (Goldman Meadows Formation) have been multiply deformed and metamorphosed. The most prominant structures are a pronounced steeply plunging stretching lineation and steeply dipping foliation. These structural data indicate that the ophiolitic and associated metasedimentary rocks have been deformed by simple shear. The ophiolitic rocks are interpreted as the remains of Archean oceanic crust, probably formed at either a mid-ocean ridge or back-arc basin. All the units of a complete ophiolite are present except for upper mantle periodotities. The absence of upper mantle rocks {{may be the result}} of detactment within the crust, rather than within the upper mantle, during emplacement. This could have been the result of a steeper geothermal gradient in the Archean oceanic lithosphere, or may have resulted from a thicker oceanic crust in the Archean...|$|E
