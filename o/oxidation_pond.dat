The storage wastewater has been pumped about 3, 600 cu. m. /day through the 18. 5 km.

Highlight was placed on the obtained effluent after treated wastewater flowed over weir crest that finding BOD under standard and also the decreasing of total coliform bacteria and fecal coliform bacteria, particularly the pathogenic bacteria decreasing down to almost zero MPN/ 100 mL. The question came up how total coliform bacteria and fecal coliform bacteria disappeared after the treated wastewater flowing over weir crest of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3. The hypothesis was set on the effect of solar radiation to DO and H 2 O 2 which were employed for bacterial organic digestion process in wastewater treatment ponds by taking the measurement randomly on 19 May 2011 that solar radiation showing the solar energy between 0 - 750 W/m 2 all together with UV-A, UV-B, spectrum and net radiation. In order to accomplish the objectives of study, the wastewater quality indicators were found BOD in sedimentation pond 1 67. 5 mg/L and <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 16. 6 mg/L for 13 hours measurement. In the same manner, the values of DO and H 2 O 2 for 13 hours measurement found in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 greater than sedimentation pond 1 in respect to 8. 9 and 7. 6 mg/L for DO and 2. 27 and 0. 31 µg/L for H 2 O 2.

For the quantity of H 2 O 2, it was obtained the relationship between net radiation and H 2 O 2 in higher correlation coefficient in sedimentation pond 1 than <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 because of smaller amount of dissolved organic and inorganic matters in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3. It would be the reason that oxygen which occurred from phytoplankton and algae photosynthesis were not employed by organic digestion and respiration of bacteria. Therefore, it had to exist DO and accumulation only in water instead of producing H 2 O 2 in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 during daylight time. This is why H 2 O 2 in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 was not varied directly to net radiation, and also causing an indication on the relationship between net radiation and H 2 O 2 in <b>oxidation</b> <b>pond</b> 3 lower than sedimentation pond 1.
