40|$|CLONEPICKER is a {{software}} pipeline that integrates sequence data with BAC clone fingerprints to dynamically select a minimal <b>overlapping</b> <b>clone</b> set covering the whole genome. In the Rat Genome Sequencing Project (RGSP), a hybrid strategy of “clone by clone” and “whole genome shotgun” approaches {{was used to}} maximize the merits of both approaches. Like the “clone by clone” method, one key challenge for this strategy was to select a low-redundancy clone set that covered the whole genome while the sequencing is in progress. The CLONEPICKER pipeline met this challenge using restriction enzyme fingerprint data, BAC end sequence data, and sequences generated from individual BAC clones as well as WGS reads. In the RGSP, an average of 7. 5 clones was identified from each side of a seed clone, and the minimal overlapping clones were reliably selected. Combined with the assembled BAC fingerprint map, a set of BAC clones that covered > 97 % of the genome was identified and used in the RGSP...|$|E
40|$|The project {{seeks to}} {{elucidate}} the molecular {{basis of an}} important genetic disease (Batten`s disease) by molecular cloning of the affected gene by utilizing an <b>overlapping</b> <b>clone</b> map of chromosome 16. Batten disease (also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder of childhood characterized by progressive loss of vision, seizures, and psychomoter disturbances. The Batten disease gene was genetically mapped to the chromosome region 16 p 12. 1 in close linkage with the genetic markers D 16 S 299 and D 16 S 298. Exon amplification of a cosmid containing D 16 S 298 yielded a candidate gene that was disrupted by a 1 kb genomic deletion in all patients containing the most common haplotype for the disease. Two separate deletions and a point mutation altering a splice site in three unrelated families have confirmed the gene as the Batten disease gene. The disease gene encodes a novel 438 amino acid membrane binding protein of unknown function...|$|E
40|$|As an {{essential}} step towards an exhaustive {{analysis of the}} coding potential of large regions of the genome, we have developed a protocol allowing the rapid isolation of transcripts defined by <b>overlapping</b> <b>clone</b> libraries. The method {{is based on the}} hybridisation of cDNA inserts, whkh had been amplified by PCR from cDNA libraries, to biotinylated DNA from cosmids or cosmid pools. Nonspecific hybrids are then removed, the selected cDNAs are eluted and reamplified by PCR. Using a cosmid containing part of the FMR- 1 gene as test, we were able to demonstrate an eighty thousand fold enrichment of cDNAs for this gene after two rounds of selection-amplification. The technique was applied to the analysis of transcripts from two cosmid contigs, together encompassing a region of 900 kb in Xq 28. These experiments have thus far resulted in the identification of 81 cDNA clones, of which 54 clones were mapped back to the cosmid contigs. Of the 54 clones placed on the contig maps, 12 cDNA clones can be shown to belong to two genes which have been previously reported (L 1 CAM and QM) ...|$|E

Four overlapping cDNA clones were characterized that coded for a low molecular weight human collagen. The cDNA clones did not, however, code for the short-chain collagens, types IX and X. The amino acid sequences derived from the clones resembled type IV collagen in that there were short interruptions in the repeating -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- sequence. The noncollagenous, carboxyl-terminal domain was, however, much shorter and contained only 18 amino acid residues. Interestingly, one of the cDNA clones contained an additional 36 nucleotides not found in an <b>overlapping</b> <b>clone.</b> The 36 nucleotides encoded four -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- repeats without changing the reading frame.

The cloned cDNA was used to study reductase transcripts in liver and reticulocytes. Two antisense RNA probes that together covered the entire coding region and part of the noncoding region of reductase mRNA were used in RNase A protection experiments. These probes detected only one transcript in liver, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial reductase are translated from the same mRNA. In contrast, two transcripts were detected in reticulocytes, one of which mismatched the liver probe approximately 30 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon.

The cro-beta-galactosidase- 70 K fusion protein reacted with various anti-RNP patient sera, a rabbit anti- 70 K antiserum, {{as well as with}} a monoclonal antibody specific for this protein. The sequences of four 70 K peptides were determined and they match parts of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 1. 3 kb insert of p 70. 1 indicating that it is a genuine 70 K cDNA. Screening of a new cDNA library constructed from polysomal mRNA of HeLa cells with the p 70. 1 clone yielded an <b>overlapping</b> <b>clone,</b> FL 70 K, which was 2. 7 kb long and covered the complete coding and 3 '-untranslated sequence of the 70 K protein in addition to 680 nucleotides upstream of the putative initiation codon, The predicted mol. wt of the encoded protein is approximately 70 kd. Amino acid analysis of the purified HeLa 70 K protein yielded values close or identical to those deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA. The 70 K protein is rich in arginine (20 %) and acidic amino acids (18 %). Extremely hydrophilic regions containing mixed-charge amino acid clusters have been identified at the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, which may function in RNA binding.

40|$|A {{hierarchical}} approach {{allows the}} completion of contiguous sets of <b>overlapping</b> <b>clones</b> for small regions of a genome, {{one at a time}} rather than tackling the whole genome at once. On the basis of the BlnI restriction map for Salmonella typhimurium LT 2, we dissected the chromosome into 21 different fragments by using a Tn 5 transposon carrying a BlnI site. Dissected chromosomal fragments were purified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and used as probes for sorting a lambda DASHII genomic library of 2, 304 primary clones. A total of 129 clones identified as spanning the region from 91 min to 98 min were partly ordered {{on the basis of the}} intensity of hybridization with mitomycin-induced Mud-P 22 phage DNAs from insertions with pac sites in opposite orientations at 93 min used as probes. Decreased signal intensity with the Mud-P 22 probes corresponded to the increased distance of the clone from the site of Mud-P 22 insertion and allowed the clones to be placed in two groups from 91 min to 93 min and from 93 min to 98 min and into four intensity categories within the two groups. A member of each category was used to generate a riboprobe from the T 3 promoter flanking the insert. This probe identified <b>overlapping</b> <b>clones</b> among the 129 clones.

The goal {{of this study is}} to clone and sequence the remaining ((subunit gene (rpoC) of X. campestris pv. campestris. It has been known that the rpoC gene of E. coli encoding an 155 kDa protein is adjacent to rpoB and belong to rpoBC operon. The nucleotide sequence of the previously isolated pBKBET- 3 plasmid that containing 1. 9 kb DNA fragment downstream of the rpoB gene was determined. Comparison the deduced amino acid sequence with that of the E. coli ((subunit protein revealed more than 90 % identity. The result suggested that Xc 11 has the same rpoB- rpoC gene order as that of E. coli. According to the sequence determined, a set of oligonucleotides, P 964 and P 1315, was designed and used in the polymerase chain reaction. By using the 351 bp PCR product as a probe, a clone was identified from the constructed Xc 11 genomic library and named pBK# 69 - 1. However, restriction mapping and Southern blot analyses showed that pBK# 69 - 1 only carry the 5 '' end 3 kb DNA fragment of rpoC gene. The same strategy was applied to obtain an <b>overlapping</b> <b>clone</b> with 4. 5 kb of insert and designed as pBK# 107 - 3. A set of deletion clones were constructed from these two selected clones and used for sequence analyses. Results of 4753 bp DNA sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames (ORF). The first ORF begins at nucleotide 64 and ends at nucleotide 4275, from which an 1403 amino acids protein with molecular weight of 155 kDa could be translated. Comparison the deduced amino acid sequence of the first ORF with ((subunit of E. coil RNA polymerase showed 70. 5 % identity. The second incomplete ORF starts at nt 4494 and an 87 amino acids polypeptide could be encoded. The predicted amino acids of the second ORF showed 76. 4 % identity with the N-terminal part of E. coli S 12 ribosomal protein. The first ORF has G+C content over 63. 8 % which is typical for most of the genes identified from Xc 11 and higher than that of E. coli.

[...] In this sequencing method, a low-resolution map is made prior to sequencing {{in order to provide}} a framework to guide the later assembly of the sequence reads of the genome. This map identifies the relative positions and <b>overlap</b> of the <b>clones</b> used for sequencing. Sets of <b>overlapping</b> <b>clones</b> that form a contiguous stretch of DNA are called contigs; the minimum number of clones that form a contig that covers the entire chromosome comprise the tiling path that is used for sequencing. Once a tiling path has been selected, its component BACs are sheared into smaller fragments and sequenced. Contigs therefore provide the framework for hierarchical sequencing.The assembly of a contig map involves several steps. First, DNA is sheared into larger (50-200kb) pieces, which are cloned into BACs or PACs to form a BAC library. Since these clones should cover the entire genome/chromosome, it is theoretically possible to assemble a contig of BACs that covers the entire chromosome. [...] Reality, however, is not always ideal. Gaps often remain, and a scaffold—consisting of contigs and gaps—that covers the map region is often the first result. [...] The gaps between contigs can be closed by various methods outlined below.|$|R

This method also allows detection of smaller <b>overlaps</b> between <b>clones</b> {{when compared to the}} analysis of restriction digests on nondenaturing agarose gels...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} {{the human}} tumor marker carci-noembryonic antigen (CEA) {{belongs to a}} gene family which can be subdivided into the CEA and the preg-nancy-specific glycoprotein subgroups. The corre-sponding proteins {{are members of the}} immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized through the presence of one IgV-like domain and a varying number of IgC-like domains. Since the function of the CEA family is not well understood, we decided to establish an animal model in the rat to study its tissue-specific and devel-opmental stage-dependent expression. To this end, we have screened an 18 -day rat placenta cDNA library with a recently isolated fragment of a rat CEA-related gene. Two <b>overlapping</b> <b>clones</b> containing the complete coding region for a putative 709 amino acid protei...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Contig {{maps are}} {{a type of}} {{physical}} map that show the native order {{of a set of}} <b>overlapping</b> genomic <b>clones.</b> <b>Overlaps</b> between <b>clones</b> can be detected by finding common sequences using a number of experimental protocols including hybridization of probes. All current mapping algorithms of which we are aware require that hybridizations be scored using a fixed number of discrete values (typically 0 / 1 or high/medium/low). When hybridization data is captured automatically using digital equipment, this provides the opportunity for hybridization intensities to be used in map construction. More fine-grained distinctions in the levels of hybridization may be exploited by algorithms to generate more accurate physical maps. Results: We describe an approach to creating contig maps that uses measured hybridization intensities instead of data scored with a fixed number of discrete values. We describe and compare four algorithms for creating physical maps with hybridization intensities. Simulations using measured intensities sampled from actual data on Aspergillus nidulans indicate that using hybridization intensities rather than data that is automatically scored with respect to threshold values may yield more accurate physical maps...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} safe method of Yeast Artificial Chromosome (YAC) {{physical}} mapping by cosmid 'fingerprinting' is presented. YACs are subcloned into cosmids which are prepared without previous separation of cloned DNA from host DNA. Groups of <b>overlapping</b> <b>clones</b> are detected {{according to their}} restriction fragments size and intensity after hybridization with total human DNA. To test this approach, a cosmid library was constructed from total DNA of a yeast strain containing a 420 kb YAC. A single contig of 84 clones was obtained with a minimal detectable overlap of 60 % i. e. a 9. 2 fold representative library. Large scale physical mapping of YACs would {{take full advantage of}} the DNA preparation procedure employed in this work and allows to take into account restriction fragment intensities...|$|R
