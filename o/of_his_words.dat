5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> man {{has given way}} to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

25|$|Clifford Bax (13 July 1886 – 18 November 1962) was a {{versatile}} English writer, known particularly as a playwright, a journalist, critic and editor, and a poet, lyricist and hymn writer.

25|$|Even {{what we hear}} must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words.</b> All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E
25|$|The trial, {{which opened}} in February 2003, centred on whether Baker had {{been aware of the}} {{contents}} of the suitcase as well as an examination of the interrogation records and the confession he had signed. Baker claimed that the statement was mispresentation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words</b> and his lawyer, Shunji Miyake, argued that since there was no video or audio recording of the interrogations, and no defence lawyer was present, {{there was no way to}} check whether falsifications and mistranslations had taken place. Miyake also questioned what he claimed were the 'leading nature' of the questions asked by the interrogators. Baker maintained that the bag was Prunier's, that he had never had the key to the case, and that he had been tricked into carrying the bag by Prunier. Prunier had been arrested for drug smuggling in Belgium a month after Baker's arrest, and his co-accused in the Belgian case had also claimed that Prunier had duped them into carrying bags with drugs. The court ruled the evidence from the Belgian police was inadmissible, and it was not introduced during the trial.|$|E

500|$|The Dictionary {{was finally}} {{published}} in April 1755, {{with the title}} page acknowledging that Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree {{in anticipation of the}} work. The dictionary as published was a huge book. Its pages were nearly [...] tall, and the book was [...] wide when opened; it contained 42,773 entries, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions, and it sold for the extravagant price of £4 10s, perhaps the rough equivalent of £350 today. An important innovation in English lexicography was to illustrate the meanings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words</b> by literary quotation, of which there were approximately 114,000. The authors most frequently cited include William Shakespeare, John Milton and John Dryden. It was years before Johnson's Dictionary, as it came to be known, turned a profit. Authors' royalties were unknown at the time, and Johnson, once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled, received no further money from its sale. Years later, many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the Webster's Dictionary and the New English Dictionary.|$|E
500|$|Jordan meets Heer's younger sister, Mandy (Sanjana Sanghi), {{during one}} of his performances, and she asks him to help Heer - who has been {{diagnosed}} with Aplastic Anemia. Although he is initially asked to leave by Heer's mother Neena (Shernaz Patel), Jordan's presence causes Heer to recover somewhat. He starts disregarding his musical obligations as he spends more time with Heer, and soon Khatana asks Heer to persuade Jordan to attend his concerts. Heer accompanies him to a show, and the media links them as a couple, portraying her as having an affair despite being married. Heer asks Jordan to complete his tour and reunite with her once again. After JJ finishes his performances, both will have some intimate time. During this time, her condition worsens. She slowly slips into a coma and is discovered by their doctor to be pregnant; Neena and Mandy guess it is because of Jordan. Mandy calls him and tells that Heer is pregnant but has gone into a coma. Jordon leaves another show right in the middle as he has done {{many times in the past}} and reaches ICU. He tries to wake her up by saying his usual funny dialogues when they meet; however, Jordan realizes that she will not survive, because she does not respond to any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words</b> nor emotional touches and kisses.

500|$|Snoop Doggy Dogg's lyrics were {{generally}} praised by critics, although they caused some controversy. He was acclaimed for the realism in his rhymes and his harmonious flow. AllMusic's Stephen Erlewine commended Snoop Doggy Dogg, saying: [...] "he's one of hip-hop's greatest vocal stylists with this record" [...] and he [...] "takes his time, {{playing with the}} flow <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words,</b> giving his rhymes a nearly melodic eloquence. Snoop is something special, with unpredictable turns of phrase, evocative imagery, and a distinctive, addictive flow". Time magazine's Christopher John Farley noted [...] "Snoop's rapping isn't flashy, but it is catchy" [...] and stated [...] "His relaxed vocal style is a perfect match for Dre's bass-heavy producing. Snoop's voice is lithe enough to snake its way around the big beats," [...] said Farley on November 29, 1993. The ideas put forward through the lyrics include Snoop Doggy Dogg's adolescent urges, as he freely talks of casual sex, smoking marijuana and gunning down rival gang members. Time magazine remarked that the notions [...] "are often unnecessarily graphic; at some points they're downright obscene" [...] and that [...] "the album would have been stronger if such misgivings about the criminal life, as well as Snoop's touches of introspection, had been applied {{to some of the}} cruder songs". The album also covered gun play, drug dealing and pimping. The New York Times said that the lyrical concepts were delivered in [...] "crudest, rudest terms".|$|E

500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, [...] "Apart from all that, we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt," [...] to which Woodfull replied, [...] "The bruise is coming out." [...] Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly and calmly, which increased the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>words.</b> He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an accusation of [...] would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E
