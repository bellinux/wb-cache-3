40|$|The {{derogation}} to use {{a percentage}} of cheaper non-organic <b>feeds</b> in <b>organic</b> livestock diets for herbivores expired from January 2008. (In Norway, a maximum 15 % of conventional feedstuffs per year was allowed until 24 August 2005, 5 % in the interim.) This study aimed to assess changes in resource use and financial impacts for organic dairy herds of the 100 % <b>organic</b> <b>feeding</b> rule (compared with 85 % <b>organic</b> <b>feeds)</b> using a two-stage stochastic programming modelling framework. In this study, the objective function was to maximise expected net income. Two organic dairy farms in the lowlands of southern Norway, both having a milk quota of 100, 000 litres but with varying farmland availability (37 hectares vs. 20 hectares), were examined. Furthermore, situations with and without possibilities to buy organic silage were studied. Milk production per cow was highest on the farm with the most strict land constraint. For farmers that fully utilise the non-organic feed allowance, the more expensive <b>organic</b> <b>feeds</b> determine the marginal feed cost. Hence, a removal of the non-organic feed allowance will not influence optimal farm practice (provided that marginal milk production still is profitable). A switch from conventional to organic concentrates as the only adjustment {{was found on the}} 37 ha farm and also on the 20 ha farm if there was no possibility to buy some organic silage. On the 20 ha farm with possibilities to buy organic silage, {{it turned out to be}} unprofitable to keep all the cows. Fewer cows resulted in several other changes in the model solution such as a lower milk yield per cow, less milk produced in total and more work off-farm. The financial gain from carrying out the optimal management changes was, however, very small. In all cases studied, the introduction of 100 % <b>organic</b> <b>feeds</b> resulted in an economic loss of NOK 19, 200 - 23, 600 (or 7 - 12 % of the expected net income with 85 % <b>organic</b> <b>feeds).</b> The economic losses were due to the price premium of organic concentrates...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, EU {{regulations}} for organic animal production set new guidelines for <b>organic</b> pig <b>feeding</b> requiring that this {{be based on}} mainly home-grown organic feedstuffs. Doubts were however raised whether these feeding regimes can maintain good growth performance and carcass quality of pigs. Three experiments were carried out to study different <b>organic</b> <b>feeding</b> regimes in weaned piglets and fattening pigs. In Experiment 1, we evaluated the use of peas and faba beans (0, 120, or 240 g kg- 1) in diets for weaned piglets. Piglets fed pea diets performed {{as well as those}} fed the control diet, whereas the highest faba bean level resulted in reduced feed intake and growth performance. In Experiment 2, we studied the replacement (0, 33, or 67 %) of rapeseed cake with blue lupins in fattening pig diets. The dietary lupin level had a quadratic effect on the weight gain of growing pigs, the best performance being observed at the 33 % replacement level. However, dietary lupin level did not influence weight gain during the finishing period and total fattening. Back fat became softer with increasing dietary lupin levels. In Experiment 3, different protein supplements were compared in organic diets from weaning to slaughter. In two-phase feeding, the best performance was observed when whey protein was used as the protein supplement, followed by soya bean cake + whey protein and rapeseed cake + fish meal. The effects of a one-phase <b>organic</b> <b>feeding</b> regime with cold-pressed rapeseed cake + whey protein did not differ from those of the two-phase <b>organic</b> <b>feeding</b> regimes. Fattening pigs fed organic diets required from two to seven days longer to reach slaughter weight than those fed conventional diets. Pigs fed organic diets had fatter carcasses, but the eating quality of organic pork did not differ from that of pork from pigs fed conventional diets. Feed costs and the circulation rate of pigs, weaners in particular, were greater and carcass prices lower in the <b>organic</b> <b>feeding</b> regimes than in the conventional ones. ...|$|R

The formation of Ag (II) increased upon increasing the concentration of nitric acid, but it decreased at higher temperatures.

This could only be achieved at the expense of the methionine content. 3. The broilers were reared from zero to three weeks of age in a broiler house in three groups of 500 broilers each on either an 80 -, a 95 -, or a 100 % organic starter diet.

Broilers that received 100 % <b>organic</b> <b>feed</b> reached a lower body weight and grew slower than broilers that received 95 % <b>organic</b> <b>feed,</b> caused mainly by a lower feed intake. 5.

In Israel, this technology is being evaluated in the culture of organ- ically produced tilapia. Among other restrictions imposed by organic standards, fish stocking densities must be low and only <b>organic</b> <b>feeds</b> and manures must be supplied. <b>Organic</b> pelleted <b>feeds</b> cost twice as much as regular aquaculture feeds.

The aim of {{the study}} was an {{assessment}} of macro- and microelements le-vel in blood serum of Charolaise breed cows with a change of <b>feeding</b> system from <b>organic</b> to indoor one, when supplementary mixtures (mineral-vitamin) were introdu-ced. Thirty two cows of Charolaise breed were selected for the experiment. The study included 2 periods taking into account final period of <b>organic</b> <b>feeding</b> system (1 st pe-riod) and 6 months of indoor feeding with mineral supplements (2 nd period). Blood for laboratory analysis was collected at the end of <b>organic</b> system <b>feeding</b> and after 6 months where mineral additives were used. Comparing both research periods, small decrease in Na and K content was noted in the 2 nd period when compared to the be-ginning of the study. An increase in Fe concentration was observed in 2 nd period of the study when compared to the 1 st one. The differences between research period were not confirmed statistically. Also slight increase in Cl, Ca, Mg and P concentration was noted in the 2 nd period of the study compared to the 1 st period. Key words: blood serum, Charolaise, feeding, mineral element...|$|R
