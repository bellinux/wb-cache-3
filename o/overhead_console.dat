25|$|Dual-way power sunroofs were {{available}} on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated {{most of the}} front <b>overhead</b> <b>console</b> that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.|$|E
25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an <b>overhead</b> <b>console,</b> which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with electronic fuel injection. Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated electronic fuel injection and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E

5000|$|The P400S Miura, {{also known}} as the Miura S, made its {{introduction}} at the Turin Motorshow in November 1968, where the original chassis had been introduced three years earlier. It was slightly revised from the P400, with the addition of power windows, bright chrome trim around external windows and headlights, new <b>overhead</b> inline <b>console</b> with new rocker switches, engine intake manifolds made 2 mm larger, different camshaft profiles, and notched trunk end panels (allowing for slightly more luggage space). Engine changes were reportedly good for an additional [...]|$|R
5000|$|The 1967 Deluxe Interior was revised, discontinuing the {{embossed}} running horse motif on {{the seat}} backs (the source for the [...] "pony interior" [...] nickname) {{in favor of a}} new deluxe interior package, which included special color options, brushed aluminum (from August 1966 production) or woodgrain dash trim, seat buttons, and special door panels. The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965-66 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome quarter trim caps, carried over from 1965-66, but these were painted to match the interior in 1968 models. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird. These were dropped {{at the end of the}} 1967 model year, and were not included in the woodgrain-trimmed 1968 interior. The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965-66, became optional, and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967-68 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and <b>overhead</b> <b>consoles</b> were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the installation of the accessory atop the steering column. The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released, and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.|$|R
5000|$|The {{performance}} {{model was}} the R/T (Road/Track), with a 383 cuin L [...] "Magnum" [...] V8, rated at [...] for 1971, {{due to a}} drop in compression. The standard transmission was a 3-speed manual. Optional R/T engines were the [...] 440 CID L Magnum, the [...] 440 CID Six-Pack and the [...] 426 CID L Hemi. The R/T was available in either the hardtop or convertible. For 1970 only, base hardtop and R/T hardtop models could be ordered with the more luxurious SE specification, which included leather seats, a vinyl roof, a smaller 'formal' rear window, and an <b>overhead</b> interior <b>console</b> that contained three warning lights (door ajar, low fuel, and seatbelts). The Challenger R/T came with a Rallye instrument cluster that included a 150 mph speedometer, an 8,000 rpm tachometer, 1972-1974 tachometer went to 7,000 rpm and an oil pressure gauge. In 1972, the R/T badging was dropped and these models were called [...] "Rallye", although they were never badged as such. The Rallye model featured a faux brake vent on the fenders. The shaker hood scoop was not available after 1971.|$|R

5000|$|The Automotive Experience {{business}} unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers. It {{is one of}} the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world. The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world. A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and <b>overhead</b> and floor <b>consoles</b> for automotive interiors. Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics. Brands produced under this {{business unit}} include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper. As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide. On June 6, 2015, Johnson Controls had scheduled an exit from the automotive seating business to concentrate on core business of building ventilation and automotive batteries. [...] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient.

40|$|With {{little to}} no {{experience}} using a Document Management System (DMS), Brunswick management is concerned that adopting a DMS will increase development and maintenance time, thereby increasing our time to market with new releases, bug-fixes, and/or service packs. It is {{the intent of this}} project to prove that the extra amount of time documenting our systems will ultimately provide a benefit to Brunswick by saving time during the maintenance phase which, will last for many years after the initial launch. And as an added benefit of this project, a specific DMS tool has been identified and evaluated throughout this project that will fulfill our immediate needs or can at least serve as a benchmark for another vendor. The Scorer Configuration Utility project was chosen to highlight the benefits of a DMS. In part, because this is a typical case where knowledge of the processing that must take place has been lost as personnel have left the organization. This loss of knowledge has cost Brunswick an indeterminable amount of money over the years and will continue to increase cost as long as a DMS is not a part of our culture. The Scorer Configuration Utility project provides a means to format the scorer registry settings, via a USB connection, before they are installed. This will speed up the replacement time by pre-configuring the hard-drive prior to installation. Now, the pinsetter type, <b>overhead</b> display type, <b>console</b> password, lane identification, IP Address, and Server name can all be configured prior to installing a hard-drive. I describe in detail how the Vector Plus server interacts with the scorers registry which control/manage eight lanes of bowling each. I go on to describe how the registry settings specify how the scorers interact with peripheral devices such as the pinsetters, overhead displays, and the lane consoles and that incorrect registry settings render these devices non- functional. I used a DMS tool from Aligned Elements to create all of the documents that I would like to see in future projects. I created Specifications, Requirements, Use Cases, and Test Cases. I also recorded all of the registry settings for each condition/combination of specific peripheral devices. The Aligned Elements tool offers a clear advantage in terms of document management. The tool is easy to use, intuitive, and it provides a structure that makes sense when grouping information like requirements, specifications, use cases, test cases, etc. I wrote the application using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with the C# programming language. The application will be installed along with the next version of the Vector Plus system...|$|R
50|$|For 2001, Dodge {{focused on}} {{interior}} upgrades as Durango's interior trim panels, dash-mounted controls, instrument panel, <b>overhead</b> <b>console,</b> and steering wheel were all redesigned.
