40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} a light weight segmented bimorph mirror for adaptive optics. It focuses on the morphing strategy and addresses the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian of the segments, which are partly outside the <b>optical</b> <b>pupil.</b> Two options are discussed, one based on truncating the singular values and one called damped least squares, which minimizes a combined measure of the sensor error and the voltage vector. A comparison of various configurations of segmented mirrors was conducted; it is shown that segmentation sharply increases the natural frequency of the system with limited deterioration of the image quality.

40|$|QC 351 A 7 no. 22 The {{statistical}} approach {{must be used}} {{to describe}} the image when object brightness, <b>optical</b> <b>pupil</b> characteristics, and image detection are all subject to random fluctuations. Use of the statistical characteristic W (the Fourier transform of probability density) is found to clarify the phenomenon and to result in a linear theory. There is a characteristic function W, corresponding to the joint statistics of the log modulus and the phase, for: the object spectrum, optical transfer function, detection transfer function and image spectrum. These four W-functions are the statistical analogy to the four Fourier spectra themselves, if the object radiation is either perfectly coherent or perfectly incoherent. Thus, in analogy to the ordinary Fourier theory of image formation, there is (1) a statistical transfer theorem linking object and image fluctuations, (2) a statistical transfer function for the optics, which may be computed from the <b>optical</b> <b>pupil</b> statistics, (3) sampling theorems, and other analogous results. The W-functions are found to determine all moments of each spectral distribution, and to imply that the moments themselves obey a transfer theorem. Also, the optical characteristic W-function seems to be useful as a quality criterion of optical system stability. In the deterministic limit, the statistical theory goes over into the ordinary Fourier theory of image formation. Random detection noise is a natural parameter of the theory, so that application to practical problems seems eminently possible...|$|E

OCT is a competing technology with confocal microscopy (CM) and confocal fluorescent microscopy (CFM), which are both used for biopsy imaging for pathology as the gold standard. OCT offers several advantages over CM/CFM: {{it is able to}} acquire a full 3 D image in a single pass, it requires little or no sample preparation time, and the axial (depth) and lateral (transverse) resolution are not dependent on one another.

40|$|The shimmering {{effects of}} {{atmospheric}} turbulence {{are familiar to}} anyone who has looked across the room through the air rising from a hot radiator, or at a distant object across a desert in the summertime. The image appears to be randomly distorted and broken up into characteristic 'speckles'. This is a real effect, not an optical illusion, so that any picture taken through the turbulence with a camera will suffer the same problem. We have studied how to reduce these turbulence effects on such camera images after they are taken. A special-purpose digital processing algorithm is used called the 'image division' method. BASIC ALGORITHM The processing approach is based upon the use of two short-exposure images, i. e. with exposure times the order of. 01 s or less. Also, the images are taken so far apart in time as to 'sec ' independent turbulence distributions in the <b>optical</b> <b>pupil</b> of the camera.

We conducted two experiments. In experiment 1 we recorded EEG from subjects aged 18 – 79. Subjects viewed images of faces and phase scrambled noise textures under nine luminance conditions, ranging from 0. 59 to 60. 8 cd/m 2. We manipulated luminance using neutral density filters. In experiment 2, 10 young subjects (age &# 60; 35) viewed similar stimuli through pinholes ranging from 1 to 5 mm. In both experiments, subjects were tested twice. We found a 1 ms/year slowdown in visual processing that was independent of luminance. Aging effects became visible around 125 ms post-stimulus and did not affect the onsets of the face-texture ERP differences. Furthermore, luminance modulated the entire ERP time-course from 60 to 500 ms. Luminance effects peaked in the N 170 time window and were independent of age. Importantly, senile miosis and individual differences in pupil size did not account for aging differences and inter-subject variability in processing speed. The pinhole manipulation also failed to match the ERPs of old subjects to those of young subjects. Overall, our results strongly suggest that early ERPs to faces (&# 60; 200 ms) are delayed by aging and that these delays are of cortical, rather than optical origin.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{dissertation}} concerns {{advances in}} high-resolution optical microscopy needed to detect faults in next generation semiconductor chips. In this application, images are made through the chips' back side to avoid opaque interconnect metal layers on the frontside. Near infrared wavelengths are required, since the silicon is relatively transparent at these wavelengths. A significant challenge in {{this technique is}} to resolve features as small as 200 nm using wavelengths exceeding 1 OOOnm. The highest imaging resolution achievable with refractive optics at infrared wavelengths is demonstrated in this dissertation using an aplanatic solid immersion lens (SIL). This is the only method that {{has been found to}} be of sufficient resolution to image the next generation of integrated circuits. While the use of an aplanatic solid immersion lens theoretically allows numerical aperture far in excess of conventional microscopy (NASIL ~ 3. 5), it also makes the system performance particularly sensitive to aberrations, especially when the samples have thicknesses that are more than a few micrometers thicker or thinner than designed thickness, or when the refractive index of the SIL is slightly different than that of the sample. In the work described here, practical design considerations of the SILs are examined. A SIL-based confocal scanning microscope system is designed and constructed. The aberrations of the system due to thickness uncertainty and material mismatch are simulated using both analytical model and ray-tracing software, and are measured in the SIL experimental apparatus. The dominant aberration for samples with thickness mismatch is found to be spherical aberration. Wavefront errors are compensated by a microelectromechanical systems deformable mirror (MEMS DM) in the <b>optical</b> system's <b>pupil.</b> The controller is implemented either with closed-loop real time sensor feedback or with predictive open-loop estimation of optical aberrations. Different DM control algorithms and aberration compensation techniques are studied and compared.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{has proven}} to be able to provide three-dimensional (3 D) volumetric images of scattering biological tissues for in vivo medical diagnostics. Unlike conventional optical microscopy, its depth-resolving ability (axial resolution) is exclusively determined by the laser source and therefore invariant over the full imaging depth. In contrast, its transverse resolution is determined by the objective's numerical aperture and the wavelength which is only approximately maintained over twice the Rayleigh range. However, the prevailing laser sources for OCT allow image depths of more than 5 mm which is considerably longer than the Rayleigh range. This limits high transverse resolution imaging with OCT. Previously, we reported a novel method to extend the depth-of-focus (DOF) of OCT imaging in Mo et al. [Opt. Express 21, 10048 (2013) ]. The approach is to create three different <b>optical</b> apertures via <b>pupil</b> segmentation with an annular phase plate. These three optical apertures produce three OCT images from the same sample, which are encoded to different depth positions in a single OCT B-scan. This allows for correcting the defocus-induced curvature of wave front in the pupil so as to improve the focus. As a consequence, the three images originating from those three optical apertures can be used to reconstruct a new image with an extended DOF. In this study, we successfully applied this method {{for the first time to}} both an artificial phantom and biological tissues over a four times larger depth range.

40|$|Purpose:  To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} real and simulated age-related changes in crystalline lens yellowing on Farnsworth–Munsell (FM) 100 hue performance. Methods:  FM 100 hue total and partial error scores (PES) were measured {{in a group of}} younger (n = 10, mean age = 22. 2 ± 2. 65 years) and a group of older (n = 10, mean age = 54. 5 ± 2. 64 years) normal observers along with psychophysical estimates of crystalline lens <b>optical</b> density and <b>pupil</b> size. Three younger observers underwent repeated FM 100 hue testing under a variety of simulated age-related lens yellowing conditions, using filters with well-defined transmittance properties which attempted to mimic the real age-related lens yellowing changes of the older group. Results:  FM 100 hue total and PES were significantly higher in the older age group compared with the younger group (p < 0. 01). Lens density measures were significantly higher in the older age group compared with the young group (p < 0. 01), but showed less scatter than individual FM 100 hue error scores. Simulated lens yellowing in the three younger observers, equivalent to the level of that of the older observers, did not affect any of their FM 100 hue total or PES. Conclusions:  Simulation of age-related lens yellowing in younger observers has little effect on FM 100 hue error score. A variety of other factors such as pupil size, background illuminaton level, iris colour and macular pigment density may contribute to the age-related increase in FM 100 hue scores...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE - This study {{quantified}} preschool children's optical {{quality in}} terms of their aberrations and modulation transfer function (MTF), and examined the dependence of MTF on pupil size and grating orientation. METHODS - Aberrometry was used to measure Zernike coefficients in 34 Chinese preschool children (18 males, 16 females; aged 4. 95 - 6. 89 years; mean, 5. 91 +/- 0. 56). For each subject, after mathematical correction for refractive error, these wavefront errors were used to calculate MTF (lambda = 550 nm) for pupil sizes from 1 to 5 mm and for gratings at orientations in 15 degrees intervals. RESULTS - Aberrations were correlated between right and left eyes, for wavefront RMS and some Zernike coefficients. Average aberrometry results showed that third-order terms predominated, in addition to some positive spherical aberration with an average higher order root mean square (RMS) of 0. 20 micro m over a 5 -mm pupil. Average MTFs were optimal for 3 -mm pupil sizes at lower spatial frequencies (< 69 cyc/deg) and slightly better than those found by similar techniques in young adults. Heights of MTFs were significantly related to higher order RMS (Spearman rho = - 0. 926). MTFs showed a small meridional anisotropy for 3 -mm pupils, with average MTF for vertical gratings (horizontal modulation) being slightly, but significantly better than for horizontal gratings (vertical modulation). There was no evidence of an oblique effect in the optics of these children.

The aim was to determine and compare the horizontal and vertical co-ordinates of the PCAx and <b>optical</b> axis from <b>pupil</b> shape and refraction information for only the horizontal meridian of the visual field. Method: The PCAx was determined from the changes with visual field angle in the ellipticity and orientation of pupil images out to ± 90 ° from fixation along the horizontal meridian for the right eyes of 30 people. This axis was compared with the optical axis determined from {{the changes in the}} astigmatic components of the refractions for field angles out to ± 35 ° in the same meridian. Results: The mean estimated horizontal and vertical field coordinates of the PCAx were (‒ 5. 3 ± 1. 9 °, ‒ 3. 2 ± 1. 5 °) compared with (‒ 4. 8 ± 5. 1 °, ‒ 1. 5 ± 3. 4 °) for the optical axis. The vertical co-ordinates of the two axes were just significantly different (p = 0. 03) but there was no significant correlation between them. Only the horizontal coordinate of the PCAx was significantly related to the refraction in the group. Conclusion: On average, the PCAx is displaced from the line-of-sight by about the same angle as the optical axis but there is more inter-subject variation in the position of the optical axis.

These maps are 2 D arrays containing digital sampled versions of functions ranging from Zernike polynomials to combination of sinusoidal wave functions in 2 D, to functions generated from a spatial frequency power spectral distribution (PSD). It also can generate optical transfer functions (OTFs), which are incorporated into the PSF calculation. The user can specify radiometrics for the target and sky background, and key performance parameters for the instrument s focal plane array (FPA). This radiometric and detector model setup is fairly extensive, and includes parameters such as zodiacal background, thermal emission noise, read noise, and dark current. The setup also includes target spectral energy distribution {{as a function of}} wavelength for polychromatic sources, detector pixel size, and the FPA s charge diffusion modulation transfer function (MTF) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of an optical system (for example, a telescope) {{is limited by}} the misalignments and manufacturing imperfections of the optical elements in the system. The impact of these misalignments and imperfections can be quantified by the phase variations imparted on light traveling through the system. Phase retrieval is a methodology for determining these variations. Phase retrieval uses images taken with the optical system and using a light source of known shape and characteristics. Unlike interferometric methods, which require an optical reference for comparison, and unlike Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors that require special optical hardware at the <b>optical</b> system's exit <b>pupil,</b> phase retrieval is an in situ, image-based method for determining the phase variations of light at the system s exit pupil. Phase retrieval can be used both as an optical metrology tool (during fabrication of optical surfaces and assembly of optical systems) and as a sensor used in active, closed-loop control of an optical system, to optimize performance. One class of phase-retrieval algorithms is the iterative transform algorithm (ITA). ITAs estimate the phase variations by iteratively enforcing known constraints in the exit pupil and at the detector, determined from modeled or measured data. The Variable Sampling Mapping (VSM) technique is a new method for enforcing these constraints in ITAs. VSM is an open framework for addressing {{a wide range of issues}} that have previously been considered detrimental to high-accuracy phase retrieval, including undersampled images, broadband illumination, images taken at or near best focus, chromatic aberrations, jitter or vibration of the optical system or detector, and dead or noisy detector pixels. The VSM is a model-to-data mapping procedure. In VSM, fully sampled electric fields at multiple wavelengths are modeled inside the phase-retrieval algorithm, and then these fields are mapped to intensities on the light detector, using the properties of the detector and optical system, for comparison with measured data. Ultimately, this model-to-data mapping procedure enables a more robust and accurate way of incorporating the exit-pupil and image detector constraints, which are fundamental to the general class of ITA phase retrieval algorithms...|$|R
40|$|A Hamamatsu Video Area Analyser {{has been}} {{coupled with a}} {{modified}} Canon IR automatic optometer. This has allowed simultaneous recording of pupil diameter and accommodation response to be made both statically and continuously, a feature not common in previous studies. Experimental work concerned pupil and accommodation responses during near vision tasks {{under a variety of}} conditions. The effects of sustained near vision tasks on accommodation have usually been demonstrated by taking post-task measures under darkroom conditions. The possibility of similar effects on pupil diameter was assessed using static and continuous recordings following a near vision task. Results showed that is luminance levels remained unchanged by using a pre-and post-task bright-empty field then, although accommodation regressed to pre-task levels,pupil diameter remained for several minutes at the contstricted level induced by the task. An investigation into the effect of a sinusoidally-modulated blur-only accommodative stimulus on pupil response demonstrated that response may be reduced or absent despite robust accommodation responses. This suggests that blur-driven acommodation alone may not be sufficient to produce a pupil near response and that the presence of other cues may be necessary. Pupil response was investigated using a looming stimulus which produced an inferred-proximity cue. It was found that a pupil response could be induced which was in synchrony with the stimulus while closed-loop accommodation response was kept constant by the constraints of <b>optical</b> blur. The <b>pupil</b> diameter of young and elderly subjects undertaking a 5 minute reading task was measured to assess the contribution of pupil constriction to near vision function in terms of depth-of-focus. Results showed that in the young subjects pupil diameter was too large to {{have a significant effect on}} depth-of-focus although it may be increased in the elderly subjects. Pupil and accommodation reponses to a temporally-modulated stimulus containing all cues present in a normal visual environment was assessed and results showed that as stimulus temporal frequency increased, pupil response showed increasing phase lag relative to closed-loop accommodation. The results of this study suggest that it may be necessary to change the accepted view of the function of pupil response as part of the near vision triad and that further study would be of benefit in particular to designers of vision aids such as, for example, bifocal contact lenses...|$|R
