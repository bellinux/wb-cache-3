40|$|Almost 30 {{years after}} its first description, HIV still remains a global pandemic. The present paper aims to review the current {{knowledge}} on the ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations of HIV infection, and present the available diagnostic and treatment options. A literature review was conducted in Medline and other available database sources. Information from related books was {{also included in the}} data analysis. It is well acknowledged that up to 80 % of HIV-infected patients eventually develop ENT manifestations; among which, oral disease appears to be the most common. Oro-pharyngeal manifestations include candidiasis, periodontal and gingival disease, HSV and HPV infection, <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>leucoplakia,</b> Kaposi’s sarcoma, and non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma. ENT manifestations in the neck can present as cervical lymphadenopathy or parotid gland enlargement. Respective nasal manifestations include sinusitis (often due to atypical bacteria), and allergic rhinitis. Finally, otological manifestations include otitis (externa, or media), inner ear involvement (sensorineural hearing loss, disequilibrium), and facial nerve palsy (up to 100 times more frequently compared to the general population). Although ENT symptoms are not diagnostic of the disease, they might be suggestive of HIV infection, or related to its progression and the respective treatment failure. ENT doctors {{should be aware of the}} ENT manifestations associated with HIV disease, and the respective diagnosis and treatment. A multi-disciplinary approach may be required to provide the appropriate level of care to HIV patients...|$|E

Os poucos trabalhos existentes na {{literatura}} relatam uma prevalência entre 6, 5 % e 21 % de acometimento bucal. OBJETIVO: Investigar os achados bucais e laboratoriais em pacientes com LES. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Foram analisados 155 pacientes com diagnóstico de LES, segundo critérios do American College of Rheumatology (ACR). O índice de dentes cariados, perdidos e obturados (CPO-D) foi registrado e avaliou-se a necessidade de tratamento periodontal por meio do índice periodontal comunitário (IPC). Foram realizados esfregaços e biópsias das lesões e bordas laterais de língua para exames citopatológicos. Exames laboratoriais foram correlacionados com os achados bucais destes pacientes. RESULTADOS: Dos 155 pacientes, 94, 1 % eram mulheres. Altos níveis de anticorpos circulantes (FAN-Hep 2) foram observados em todos os pacientes, sendo 41, 9 % positivos para a pesquisa de anticorpos anti-DNA de fita dupla. O índice CPO-D médio correspondeu a 18, 5 e de acordo com o IPC, 18 % apresentaram bolsas periodontais de 4 - 5 mm e 5, 9 % de 6 mm ou mais. Foram biopsiadas oito lesões bucais, mas somente três casos foram considerados compatíveis com a indicação clínica de LES. Os principais sítios acometidos foram dorso de língua, mucosa jugal e lábios. A prevalência de candidíase correspondeu a 20, 1 % e a de leucoplasia pilosa oral a 3, 7 %. CONCLUSÃO: Pacientes com LES apresentam condição periodontal precária e baixa prevalência de lesões bucais e, além disso, a citopatologia mostrou-se importante no diagnóstico de infecções relacionadas com imunossupressão, como candidíase e leucoplasia pilosa oral. INTRODUCTION: Systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease, which {{is characterized by}} several clinical manifestations. A few studies in the literature state estimated prevalence of 6. 5 % to 21 % in oral manifestations. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the oral and laboratorial findings in patients with SLE. MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred fifty-five patients diagnosed with SLE were analyzed {{in accordance with the}} American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. The index of decayed, missed and filled teeth (DMFT) was registered and the necessity of periodontal treatment was evaluated by the Community Periodontal Index (CPI). Furthermore, biopsies and smears of the lateral borders of the tongue were performed for cytopathological exams. Laboratory exams were correlated with patients' oral findings. RESULTS: Ninety-four comma one percent of 155 patients were women. High levels of circulating autoantibodies (ANA-Hep 2) were observed in all patients and 41. 9 % of them were positive for anti-double stranded DNA. Mean DMFT index was 18. 5. According to CPI, 18 % showed periodontal pockets of 4 - 5 mm and 5. 9 % pockets of 6 mm or more. Eight oral lesions were biopsied, but only three cases were considered compatible with clinical indication of SLE. The main affected sites were dorsum of the tongue, buccal mucosa and lips. The prevalence of candidiasis and <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>leucoplakia</b> corresponded to 20. 1 % and 3. 7 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that patients with SLE present low prevalence of oral lesions and poor periodontal conditions.

50|$|The common {{oral health}} issues {{associated}} with immunocompromised patients are Candidiasis and Herpes viral infections, ulcers, periodontal disease, and malignant neoplasms.

40|$|The BZLF 1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is a key}} immediate-early protein {{which has}} been shown to disrupt virus latency in EBV-infected B cells.

Biopsies of <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> leukoplakia, an AIDS-associated lesion characterized by high-level EBV replication, were examined by immunohistochemistry using the BZ 1 monoclonal antibody. A differentiation-associated pattern of BZLF 1 expression was observed, BZ 1 reacting with nuclei of the upper spinous layer of the lesion. This finding suggests that the BZLF 1 promoter may be regulated by the degree of squamous differentiation.

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} {{expression}} of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcripts encoding proteins homologous to important human proteins in diverse EBV associated diseases. The proteins were: BHRF 1 (homologous to Bcl- 2), BDLF 2 (homologous to cyclin B 1), BARF 1 (homologous to intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1)), and BCRF 1 (viral IL- 10 (vIL- 10), homologous to human IL- 10 (hIL- 10)). METHODS: Six cases of <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> leukoplakia, seven of Hodgkin's disease, eight of T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and nine of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were examined at the mRNA level using either the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA). Different primer sets allowed the differentiation by RT-PCR of the latent (Cp/Wp driven) and lytic (Hp driven) transcripts of BHRF 1. A specific NASBA reaction was developed {{for the detection of}} vIL- 10 and BDLF 2 transcripts and this was tested initially on cell lines and later on clinical samples. RESULTS: vIL- 10 and BDLF 2 were expressed almost exclusively in <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> leukoplakia, whereas BARF 1 transcripts were present in all cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with weak expression in one <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> leukoplakia and isolated cases of lymphoid malignancy. Both BHRF 1 transcripts were detected across the range of tissues tested, but strong expression of lytic BHRF 1 transcripts was seen only in <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> leukoplakia. CONCLUSIONS: vIL- 10 and BDLF 2 transcripts are expressed during productive EBV infection and are unlikely to be important in the pathogenesis of EBV associated malignancies. BARF 1 appears to be expressed preferentially during viral latency and is more closely associated with malignant rather than benign epithelial proliferations.

40|$|Aim and Objective: This {{study was}} carried out with the primary aim of {{correlating}} oral changes and general changes of HIV-infected patients with their CD 4 count.

The intrahost molecular epidemiology of EBV infection was characterized in subjects treated with valacyclovir to suppress EBV replication. Tongue epithelial tissues of HIV-seropositive subjects were found to support not only EBV replication but also persistent, nonproductive EBV infection. EBV appeared to enter the tongue from the blood reservoir of infection and, possibly, from exogenous sources as well. EBV transition from the blood to the tongue appeared to occur even during valacyclovir-mediated suppression of EBV replication, suggesting EBV entry into tongue epithelial tissue as a cell-associated latent infection.
