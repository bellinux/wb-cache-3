40|$|In {{this study}} we show that social voles (Microtus socialis guentheri) {{preserve}} {{the same level of}} activity and spatio-temporal organization of behavior whether exploring a small (1 × 1 m) or a large (2 × 2 m) <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> In each <b>open</b> <b>field,</b> a vole established a home base from which it set on to round-trips of exploration; taking fewer but longer trips in the large <b>open</b> <b>field,</b> compared with more frequent but shorter trips in the small <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> Each trip comprised bouts of progression (locomotion) interrupted by stops. The number of stops per trip was the same for both large <b>open</b> <b>field</b> (longer trips) and small <b>open</b> <b>field</b> (shorter trips), and achieved by scaling the distance between stops according {{to the size of the}} <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> Voles traveled more along the walls in the large compared with the small <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> These adjustments in locomotor behavior to <b>open</b> <b>field</b> size were observed immediately after the voles were introduced into the arena, indicating that the perceived distances available for locomotion were identified by the voles immediately at the beginning of exploration. It is suggested that these properties of spontaneous exploration are an expression of navigation using visual landmarks and path integration...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare <b>open</b> <b>field</b> and greenhouse tomato production systems in terms of energy efficiency, energy intensiveness, energy productivity, benefit to cost ratio and amount of renewable and non-renewable energy uses. Data were collected from 128 and 16 <b>open</b> <b>field</b> and greenhouse tomato growers, respectively, by using a face-to-face questionnaire in 2010. The results showed that the total energy requirement under <b>open</b> <b>field</b> and greenhouse systems were 47647. 12 and 2102678. 73 MJ ha- 1, respectively.

5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in <b>open</b> <b>fields</b> with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

40|$|The <b>open</b> <b>field</b> {{activity}} {{monitoring system}} comprehensively assesses locomotor and behavioral activity levels of mice. It {{is a useful}} tool for assessing locomotive impairment in animal models of neuromuscular disease and efficacy of therapeutic drugs that may improve locomotion and/or muscle function. The <b>open</b> <b>field</b> activity measurement provides a different measure than muscle strength, which is commonly assessed by grip strength measurements. It can also show how drugs may affect other body systems as well when used with additional outcome measures. In addition, measures such as total distance traveled mirror the 6 min walk test, a clinical trial outcome measure. However, <b>open</b> <b>field</b> activity monitoring is also associated with significant challenges: <b>Open</b> <b>field</b> activity measurements vary according to animal strain, age, sex, and circadian rhythm. In addition, room temperature, humidity, lighting, noise, and even odor can affect assessment outcomes.

5|$|NY383 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY36 in the hamlet of Mumford, located {{just north of}} the border between Monroe and Livingston Counties in the town of Wheatland. Taking on the name Scottsville–Mumford Road, NY383 follows Oatka Creek east through <b>open</b> <b>fields</b> and passes through the small hamlet of Garbutt {{on its way to the}} village of Scottsville, where it becomes Caledonia Avenue. At an intersection with the southern terminus of NY386, NY383 turns east onto Main Street and follows it through the residential southern portion of the village and past the Scottsville Free Library. Main Street comes to an end at a junction with River Road (NY251, which has its western terminus here) and Rochester Street near the northern bank of Oatka Creek. Here, NY383 curves north onto Rochester Street and proceeds through eastern Scottsville. The street name of NY383 becomes Scottsville Road upon intersecting the western terminus of NY253. Past this junction, the surroundings shift from village streets to housing tracts as the route exits Scottsville.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{different}} roofing systems {{in comparison to the}} <b>open</b> <b>field</b> (closed tunnel, rain shelter - <b>open</b> <b>field)</b> were investigated in a field experiment during the seasons 2009 to 2011 at the Chamber of Agriculture North-Rhine Westfalia, Station Cologne-Auweiler, Germany. Four shortday varieties ('Clery', 'Darselet', 'Elsanta' and 'Sonata') were used. Considered quality features were yield, behaviour of the fruit during storage, fruit quality such as fruit firmness and sugar- and acid contents. The yield of the shortday strawberries was highest in the tunnel for normal and cold temperatures; under hot conditions the yield was reduced. The rain shelter protects against freezing during cold periods and at high temperatures it reduces heat stress, so that the yield under the shelter was high. The lowest yield was found in <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> Fruits from <b>open</b> <b>field</b> decays fastest due to the influence of rain; fruits from rain shelter ranked between tunnel and <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> In closed tunnel fruits trends to result in higher quality.

It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to <b>open</b> <b>fields</b> to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time.

40|$|Transient {{prenatal}} vitamin D deficiency produces hyperlocomotion in {{the adult}} rat. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effects of acute restraint on the behaviour of DVD and control rats in the <b>open</b> <b>field.</b> Rats were conceived and born to developmentally vitamin D (DVD) deficient or replete (control) dams and, at 8 weeks of age, were monitored for 30 min in an <b>open</b> <b>field</b> using automated video tracking software. Half of the rats were restrained within a towel for 5 min immediately before the <b>open</b> <b>field</b> test. The remainder received minimal handling prior to the <b>open</b> <b>field</b> test. Repeating previous findings, DVD deficient animals had enhanced locomotion during the first 10 min of the <b>open</b> <b>field</b> test compared to control rats. By contrast, there were no differences in locomotor activity after acute restraint stress. The time rats spent in the corners and side of the <b>open</b> <b>field</b> was affected by prenatal diet. DVD rats spent less time in the corners and more time in the side than control rats across the whole 30 min test. This difference was not seen in rats with acute restraint stress. The time spent in the centre was not altered by prenatal diet or acute restraint. Thus, transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency induces a transient spontaneous hyperlocomotion in adulthood that is modulated by acute restraint stress. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into <b>open</b> <b>fields</b> called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E

The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E
