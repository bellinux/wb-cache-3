5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H.

The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E

Joe also goes on to point out that Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an off the wall reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what cutaway to play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E

5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
