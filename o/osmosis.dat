5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} <b>osmosis.</b> Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse <b>osmosis,</b> or rain water.|$|E
5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse <b>osmosis,</b> use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, eight {{diesel engines}} and {{electricity}} generators, four for each ship, were ordered from Wärtsilä. On 4 March 2008, contracts for {{the supply of}} 80,000tonnes of steel were awarded to Corus Group, with an estimated value of £65million. Other contracts included £3million for fibre optic cable, over £1million for reverse <b>osmosis</b> equipment to provide over 500tonnes of fresh water daily, and £4million for aviation fuel systems. On 3 April 2008, a contract for the manufacture of aircraft lifts (worth £13m) was awarded to MacTaggart Scott of Loanhead, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse <b>osmosis</b> membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse <b>osmosis</b> unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of <b>osmosis</b> by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs. Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and Swartpuntia, {{the group is}} both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and the most {{difficult}} to place within the existing tree of life. Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or <b>osmosis.</b> However, others argue against this.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by <b>osmosis</b> - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or <b>osmosis.</b> Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in <b>osmosis</b> and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E
5|$|The {{push for}} this change was {{the reign of}} David I and the Davidian Revolution. Feudalism, {{government}} reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns (called burghs) began in this period. These institutions and the immigration of French and Anglo-French knights and churchmen facilitated cultural <b>osmosis,</b> whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom's original territory in the east became, like the newly acquired south-east, English-speaking, {{while the rest of}} the country retained the Gaelic language, apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, which remained under Norse rule until 1468. The Scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was relative peace with England, trade and educational links were well developed with the Continent and at the height of this cultural flowering John Duns Scotus was one of Europe's most important and influential philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by <b>osmosis,</b> while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by <b>osmosis</b> to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
25|$|Reverse <b>osmosis</b> {{may not be}} viable for brine treatment, due to the {{potential}} for fouling caused by hardness salts or organic contaminants, or damage to the reverse <b>osmosis</b> membranes from hydrocarbons.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} {{used to treat}} wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards {{and make sure that}} the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: Ozonation, ultrafiltration, aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward <b>osmosis,</b> reverse <b>osmosis,</b> advanced oxidation.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{technologies}} such as reverse <b>osmosis</b> and ultraviolet disinfection are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply.|$|E
25|$|Treated {{wastewater}} can be reused {{in industry}} (for example in cooling towers), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture {{and in the}} rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in wetlands). In rarer cases it {{is also used to}} augment drinking water supplies. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse.

The following are some of the typical technologies: Ozonation, ultrafiltration, aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward <b>osmosis,</b> reverse <b>osmosis,</b> advanced oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{microorganisms}} cannot live in {{an overly}} salty environment: water is drawn out of their cells by <b>osmosis.</b> For this reason salt is used to preserve some foods, such as smoked bacon, fish, or cabbage.|$|E
25|$|For {{many types}} of reuse {{applications}} wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps {{before it can be}} used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example reverse <b>osmosis),</b> and disinfection.|$|E
25|$|A minimum energy {{consumption}} for seawater desalination of around 1 kWh/m3 has been determined, excluding prefiltering and intake/outfall pumping. Under 2 kWh/m3 {{has been achieved}} with reverse <b>osmosis</b> membrane technology, leaving limited scope for further energy reductions.|$|E
25|$|The macula densa {{cause an}} {{increase}} in Na+ reabsorption, which causes water to follow in via <b>osmosis</b> and leads to an ultimate increase in plasma volume. Further, the macula densa releases adenosine which causes constriction of the afferent arterioles.|$|E
25|$|Other popular {{methods for}} purifying water, {{especially}} for local private supplies are listed below. In some countries {{some of these}} methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies. Particularly important are distillation (de-salination of seawater) and reverse <b>osmosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Collected {{blood from}} the {{subdural}} bleed may draw in water due to <b>osmosis,</b> causing it to expand, which may compress brain tissue and cause new bleeds by tearing other blood vessels. The collected blood may even develop its own membrane.|$|E
25|$|Dow Water and Process Solutions (DW) is a {{business}} unit which manufactures Filmtec reverse <b>osmosis</b> membranes which are used to purify water for human use in the Middle East. The technology was used during the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the protein}} moves {{chloride}} and thiocyanate ions (with a negative charge) {{out of an}} epithelial cell to the covering mucus. Positively charged sodium ions follow passively, increasing the total electrolyte concentration in the mucus, resulting in the movement of {{water out of the}} cell via <b>osmosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The current {{trend in}} dual-purpose {{facilities}} is hybrid configurations, {{in which the}} permeate from reverse <b>osmosis</b> desalination is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination. Basically, two or more desalination processes are combined along with power production. Such facilities have been implemented in Saudi Arabia at Jeddah and Yanbu.|$|E
25|$|When the {{transmission}} of generated wind power to nearby land is not economical, the power {{can be used in}} power to gas applications to produce hydrogen gas, ammonia / urea, reverse <b>osmosis</b> water desalination, natural gas, LPG, alkylate / gasoline, etc. on floating platforms which can be easily transported to nearby consuming centres.|$|E
25|$|New technologies, like reverse <b>osmosis</b> {{can create}} {{unlimited}} amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, {{and even from}} humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into potable water and brine. Atmospheric water generators extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.|$|E
25|$|Reverse osmosis: Mechanical {{pressure}} {{is applied to}} an impure solution to force pure water through a semi-permeable membrane. Reverse <b>osmosis</b> is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available, although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create. Unless membranes are well-maintained, algae and other life forms can colonize the membranes.|$|E
25|$|The Ashkelon {{seawater}} reverse <b>osmosis</b> (SWRO) {{desalination plant}} {{was the largest}} in the world when it was commissioned. The project was developed as a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran. In March 2006, it was voted 'Desalination Plant of the Year' in the Global Water Awards.|$|E
25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient <b>osmosis</b> is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by <b>osmosis</b> via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E
25|$|Brine {{treatment}} is commonly encountered when treating cooling tower blowdown, produced water from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), produced water from natural gas extraction such as coal seam gas, frac flowback water, acid mine or acid rock drainage, reverse <b>osmosis</b> reject, chlor-alkali wastewater, {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent, and waste streams from food and beverage processing.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone release: This {{steroid hormone}} is {{released}} from the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II or high serum potassium levels. Aldosterone stimulates sodium retention and potassium excretion by the kidneys. Since sodium is the main ion that determines the amount of fluid in the blood vessels by <b>osmosis,</b> aldosterone will increase fluid retention, and indirectly, arterial pressure.|$|E
