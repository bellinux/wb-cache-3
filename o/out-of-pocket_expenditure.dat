Official government reports monitoring health expenditure showed that over the years the share of government health budget allocation as a total government budget during the PASDEP period has shown some sign of improvement. For example, health budget allocation as a proportion of received regional public block grant from federal government accounted for 10.1% in 2008/09. However, health care funding still remain a continued challenge for the health care system of Ethiopia prompting to an inward and outward looking for the mobilization of additional health resources such as community and social insurance schemes, enhancing in the user fees revenues and increased mobilization of funding from external sources-global and health development partners. Figure 2.11: Trends of Health Expenditure in USD/CapitaPastoralist Health ServicePastoralist population in Ethiopia constitutes about 10% of the total population of the country. Yet, there is Lack of appropriate health service delivery package to address the health care needs of the communities in the Pastoralist regions. This has prompted to establish two core objectives under HSDP-II regarding the Pastoralist health services and systems. These were to establish an appropriate health service delivery for the pastoralist population and to increase coverage and utilization of health services in pastoralist population. In this regard, a concept paper, [...] "Health Service Delivery to Pastoralists", was developed by FMOH and the 16 HEP packages were tailored to pastoralists needs and have been translated into local languages. In addition, as part of government’s effort to give technical assistance to the emerging regions, a board composed of members form six ministries was established under the Ministry of Federal Affairs including a technical committee for the integration of support to the Newly Emerging Regions.|$|E

40|$|Using {{household}} panel data from Vietnam, this paper compares <b>out-of-pocket</b> health <b>expenditures</b> on outpatient care at a health facility between insured and uninsured patients {{as well as}} across various providers. In the random effects model, the estimated coefficient of the insurance status variable suggests that insurance reduces out-of-pocket spending by 24 % for those with the compulsory and voluntary coverage and by about 15 % for those with the health insurance for the poor coverage. However, the modest financial protection of the compulsory and voluntary schemes disappears once we control for time-invariant unobserved individual effects using the fixed effects model. Additional analysis of the interaction terms involving the type of insurance and health facility suggests that the overall insignificant reduction in <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{as a result of}} the insurance schemes masks wide variations in the reduction in out-of-pocket sending across various providers. Insurance reduces <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> more for those enrollees using district and higher level public health facilities than those using commune health centers. Compared to the uninsured patients using district hospitals, compulsory and voluntary insurance schemes reduce <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> by 40 and 32 %, respectively.

The aim of this article was to describe the annual individual dental expenditure of Australian adults. METHODS Self-reported service use and expenditure data were sourced from a sample of 3000 adults aged 30 to 61 years who were randomly selected from the electoral roll. Bivariate associations between total individual dental expenditure and <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> (fees less insurance rebate) and a range of participant characteristics were explored. RESULTS Response rate for the baseline questionnaire was 39. 4 % and of these, 53. 1 % responded at 12 -month follow-up. The mean total dental expenditure was $ 702 and mean <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> was $ 489. Toothache was associated with total dental expenditure; adults experiencing toothache had higher median expenditure ($ 445) than adults who hardly ever/never had toothache ($ 308) (p < 0. 05).

We studied how deliveries were financed among mothers of a birth cohort and whether they were {{an important source of}} household <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Methods All deliveries occurring in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004, were recruited for a birth cohort study. All mothers were interviewed just after birth and three months later. Comprehensive data on the pregnancy, delivery, birth conditions and newborn health were collected, along with detailed information on expenses related to the delivery. Results The majority of the deliveries (81 %) were financed by the public health system, a proportion that increased to more than 95 % among the 40 % poorest mothers. Less than 1 % of these mothers reported some <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Even among those mothers covered by a private health plan, nearly 50 % of births were financed by the SUS. Among the 20 % richest, a third of the deliveries were paid by the SUS, 50 % by private health plans and 17 % by direct payment.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} for excessive weight {{has also}} been increasing dramatically in Portugal over the last decades. The consequences for families {{as well as for}} the publicly funded Portuguese health care system are a matter of policy interest. This paper uses an econometric model to compute the fraction of the national out- of-pocket health care expenditures attributable to overweight and obesity among Portuguese adults. Given that public health care system pays for a substantial share of the national health care expenditures, the estimated the <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> is only a share of the total expenditures. Per-capita expenditures and the burden that obesity and overweight impose on families are also estimated. Two waves of the Portuguese National Health Survey (NHS), namely; 1995 / 1996 and 1998 / 1999 are considered. The results suggest that <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> due to excess weight have increased sharply during these 3 years. The two-part model estimates suggest that the obese and overweight are more likely to incur <b>out-of-pocket</b> health care <b>expenditures</b> but, in the restricted sample of those that incur expenditures, there is weak or no evidence that the obese or overweight spend, on average, more than those of normal weight. Overall, it is estimated that in 1995 / 1996, more than 1. 8 % <b>out-of-pocket</b> health care <b>expenditures</b> were attributable to obesity and 2 % to overweight (although not statistically significant). The estimated percentages are over 2. 9 % for obesity and 4 % for overweight in 1998 / 1999. Combined, the estimated attributable percentage of national <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> due to excess weight was 3. 8 % in 1995 / 1996 and 6. 9 % in 1998 / 1999. Per-capita expenditures due to obesity or overweight are small, on average, in absolute terms, but they can be a significant cost for low income families. With respect to public policy concerns, the results suggest that measures which only slightly increase the <b>out-of-pocket</b> health care <b>expenditures</b> of being obese (overweight) are likely to be inefficient...|$|R

Few cost-of-illness studies examined the complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) burden, considering {{at the same time}} health and social care, cash allowances, informal care, and <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> by families. Methods: This is a comprehensive cost-of-illness study based on the baseline data from a randomized controlled trial (UP-TECH) enrolling 438 patients with moderate AD and their primary caregiver living in the community. Results: The societal burden of AD, composed of public, patient, and informal care costs, was about € 20, 000 /yr. Out of this, the cost borne by the public sector was € 4, 534 /yr. The main driver of public cost was the national cash-for-care allowance (€ 2, 324 /yr), followed by drug prescriptions (€ 1, 402 /yr). <b>Out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> predominantly concerned the cost of private care workers. The value of informal care peaked at € 13, 590 /yr. Socioeconomic factors do not influence AD public cost, but do affect the level of <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Conclusion: The burden of AD reflects the structure of Italian welfare. The families predominantly manage AD patients. The public expenditure is mostly for drugs and cash-for-care benefits. From a State perspective in the short term, the advantage of these care arrangements is clear, compared to the cost of residential care.

Equalizing only the net claims, as done in Switzerland, creates incentives for cream skimming and prevents insurers from incorporating <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> and moral hazard reductions into their premium structure. In an empirical analysis, we examine the effect of self-selection and conclude that the Swiss and Dutch risk equalization systems do not fully adjust for differences in health status between those who choose a deductible and those who do not.

Estimates for coexistence of MCC range from one-fourth of all primary care attendees in Spain to two-thirds of all medicare attendees in the United States. This study was designed to estimate the similar prevalence and patterns in an Indian outpatient setting. Materials and Methods: This study was performed at All India Institute of Medical Sciences Bhopal between May and June 2013, a hospital which had just started outpatient services in this period. All consecutive patients that presented to Medicine, Neurology, and Orthopedics clinics were sought {{to be included in the}} study, and information about their current diagnoses was abstracted from their outpatient records. All patients with one or more chronic disease diagnosis were asked about their monthly <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure.</b> We performed a descriptive analysis of the demographic, medical diagnoses, and <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> variables. Results: A total of 785 patients were included in the study, and 286 (36 %) of them had one or more chronic disease diagnosis. Of these, 103 (13 %) had a single chronic disease, while 183 (23 %) had more than one chronic disease diagnosis. Among those with MCCs, chronic vascular diseases in combination, followed by combinations of chronic vascular and immunological diseases were common patterns. There was a significant rising trend in average <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> with increasing number of chronic disease diagnoses. Conclusion: Co-existence of multiple chronic diseases is common in those who seek hospital-based care. This fact has important implications for education and clinical decision making in primary care...|$|E
40|$|Background: Access to {{affordable}} and effective {{health care is}} a challenge in low- and middle- income countries. <b>Out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> for {{health care is a}} major cause of impoverishment. One way to facilitate access and overcome catastrophic expenditure is through a health insurance mechanism, whereby risks are shared and financial inputs pooled by way of contributions. This study examined factors that influenced the enrolment status of dairy farmers in Western Kenya to a community health insurance (CHI) schem...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{healthcare}} expenditures in seven South Asian countries namely, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal. The longitudinal data has been taken for 19 years from 1995 to 2013. We specifically examine the out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in these countries. The per-capita health expenditure differences have been compared. We also develop panel data pooled OLS model for <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> with the factors affecting it, i. e. per capita health expenditure, household final consumption expenditure and public health expenditure. The work is in line with the earlier studies of determinants of out-of-pocket health expenditures. The results suggest that Maldives has the highest per capita health expenditure while out-of-pocket health expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure on health is highest for the India. The fixed and random effect is evidenced on health expenses across the years and cross section based on various determinants. The novel aspect of the work is that, this is an attempt to explain healthcare financing in the developing economies. The key determinant of <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditure</b> is the final household expenditures as the percentage of gross domestic product...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{trends in}} access to dental care among middle-income Canadians. METHODS: A {{secondary}} data analysis of six Canadian surveys that collected information on dental insurance coverage, cost-barriers to dental care, and <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> for dental care was conducted for select years from 1978 to 2009. Descriptive analyses {{were used to}} outline and compare trends among middle-income Canadians with other levels of income as well as national averages. RESULTS: By 2009, middle-income Canadians had the lowest levels of dental insurance coverage (48. 7 %) compared to all other income groups. They reported the greatest increase in cost-barriers to dental care, from 12. 6 % in 1996 to 34. 1 % by 2009. Middle-income Canadians had the largest rise in <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> for dental care since 1978. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that affordability issues in accessing dental care are no longer just {{a problem for the}} lowest income groups in Canada, but are now impacting middle-income earners as a consequence of their lack of, or decreased access to, comprehensive dental insurance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Changes {{in third}} party financing, whether public or private, {{are linked to}} a household’s ability to access dental care. By {{removing}} costs at point of purchase, changes in financing influence the need to reach into one’s pocket, thus facilitating or limiting access. This study asks: How have historical changes in dental care financing influenced household <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> for dental care in Canada? Methods: This is a mixed methods study, comprised of an historical review of Canada’s dental care market and an econometric analysis of household <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> for dental care. Results: We demonstrate that changes in financing {{have important implications for}} out-of-pocket expenditures: with more financing come drops in the amount a household has to spend, and with less financing come increases. Low- and middle-income households appear to be most sensitive to changes in financing. Conclusions: Alleviating the price barrier to care is a fundamental part of improving equity in dental care in Canada. How people have historically spent money on dental care highlights important gaps in Canadian dental care policy. Background Equity in dental care use has recently gained more prominenc...|$|R
30|$|We {{observed}} <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>expenditures</b> for {{the most}} recent health facility visit for both consultation (mean US$ 25.5, median US$ 3.3) and medications (mean $US 13.3, median US$ 17.2) with total expenditures averaging US$ 25.5 (median US$ 18.6) for care received by Syrian refugees at primary level facilities. These amounts reflect reported expenditures at primary health care centers in the public networks (MoPH and MOSA facilities) {{as well as those}} operated privately and by NGOs.|$|R
