25|$|While the Peranakan {{culture is}} still a living one, it is almost extinct today, due to Malaysia's ethnic {{policies}} that classify the Peranakans as Chinese. Although many have been reabsorbed into the mainstream Chinese community, others have opted for more Westernised ways of life. Still, their legacy lives <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> distinctive architecture, as exemplified by the Pinang Peranakan Mansion and the Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, {{as well as their}} cuisine, elaborate costumes like the nyonya kebaya, and exquisite handicrafts.|$|E

25|$|According to Wood his {{character}} had long hankered {{for a sense}} of normality that other characters on the show have. He said that finding love had changed {{his character}}'s priorities. Grace had become Trevor's main focus and the gangster business played second. In one story, Grace has Trevor arrested for her father's murder. Wood believed that Trevor was understanding of the betrayal because she was grieving. He added that Trevor's understanding was the reason they were able to move <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> relationship.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the age of}} the colony, castes {{are almost}} always indistinguishable. Caste {{totipotency}} exists where all individual wasps are totipotent. Totipotency is the ability of a single cell to produce all of the differentiated cells in an organism. Therefore, one young wasp {{could turn out to be}} a queen or a worker. So, caste determination is dictated post-imaginally (pre-adult determination). In Parachartergus fraternus, the reproductive females resemble non reproductive females: there are not many physical differences. Based on morphology alone it is difficult to distinguish between castes. There is evidence for caste flexibility in Parachartergus fraternus. Intermediates may be potential queens but also perform some worker activities early <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation. Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> life.|$|E

25|$|In 1873 {{the king}} {{established}} the 'Auditing Office' (หอรัษฎากรพิพัฒน์, now the Ministry of Finance). It {{was created to}} modernize and simplify the collection of state revenues and taxes to the treasury. At the same time, however, it deprived the control of nobility (as landowners) over tax farms, which for generations had constituted {{a large part of}} their income. The following years the king by Royal Decree created the 'Privy Council of Siam' (สภากรรมการองคมนตรี). Copied from the European tradition, the council was an effort by the king to shore up his own legitimacy and to create an elite he could rely <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>their</b> inauguration speeches, the forty-eight councilors pledged allegiance to the Monarch and his heirs.|$|E
25|$|In the 1905 English cricket season Lancashire {{went through}} the County Championship unbeaten, which was enough to clinch the Championship title. Lancashire drew ten games, but their 16 wins were still {{more than any other}} team could muster. Defending champions Middlesex fell to fourth place, losing two {{successive}} matches to Kent and Nottinghamshire in June to have a negative percentage five games into the season. They did eventually win nine games, though, which was enough to take them past everyone bar Yorkshire and Kent. Yorkshire were two losses from sharing the Championship with Lancashire, and drew with the Champions on both occasions; despite Lancashire following <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> match at Headingley, Johnny Tyldesley made an unbeaten century from number three to draw the game. However, even a win in this match could not have given Yorkshire the title.|$|E
25|$|The reader learns a {{great deal}} about what the family was like from how the robots {{continue}} <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> functions. Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, but no one is there. Robotic mice vacuum the home and tidy up. As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto {{the side of the house}} (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed. By the next morning, the entire house has collapsed except for one wall that announces the date over and over.|$|E
