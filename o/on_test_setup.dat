40|$|Abstract—Event-driven {{controllers}} {{differ from}} the standard digital controllers as their sample times are generally not periodic (time equidistant). In literature several proposals for event-driven controllers are made {{in order to reduce}} the number of control updates and consequently the processor load needed for its implementation. This is possible without deteriorating the control performance significantly. However, experimental validation has not been presented in literature. This paper aims at filling this gap. Simulations, as well as experiments on a copier paper path <b>test</b> <b>setup,</b> show that a reduction in the number of control updates indeed results in a considerable reduction of the processor load, with only a small decrease of control performance. Furthermore, we present a method to predict the processor load very accurately, without having to implement the controller <b>on</b> a <b>test</b> <b>setup...</b>|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{and control}} of clutch engagements has been {{recognized}} as a challenging problem, due to nonlinear and time-varying dynamics, switching discontinuously between two phases. Furthermore, the optimal references are not known a priori and vary with operating conditions. To address these issues a two-level control scheme is proposed, consisting of a learning algorithm at the high level, updating parameterized references to be tracked at the low level. To simplify the tracking, the controls for both phases are separated. In a first implementation, two (non) linear model predictive controllers (NMPCs) are used sequentially, while in a second implementation these are replaced by two Iterative Learning Controllers (ILCs). The performance and robustness are investigated <b>on</b> a <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> with wet-clutches, and it is shown that both implementations combined with suitable high level algorithms result in good engagements. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|While {{simulating}} electrical systems it {{is often}} important to determine all the current and voltage signals in a 6 switch voltage source inverter. Typically, the inverter model structure depends on the application it has to supply. As a consequence {{only a limited number}} of switching state combinations are modeled. Simulation software often offers black box blocks able to handle all switching states. However, such methods often involve iterative solvers because the voltage and current signals affect each other which results in a high computational cost. In this paper, a general model, which considers all possible switching states is introduced. Using this model it is possible to determine all current and voltage signals using only one single matrix inverse regardless of the application and with a reasonable computational effort.

40|$|Full-scale {{structural}} {{testing of}} of aircraft structures {{has been and}} still is {{the task of the}} aircraft industry when new aircrafts are developed. The NLR performs structural testing of aircraft structures for certification, this is done using structural <b>test</b> <b>setups.</b> Structural <b>testing</b> consists out of static testing (ultimate load) and fatigue testing (lifetime). The NLR is developing a new structural testing methodology whereby the testing behaviour is predicted using computational models before the certification test is actually performed, called virtual testing. This has the advantage of performance prediction as well as a reduction in costs and risks. This thesis covers the development of a virtual testing methodology for structural <b>test</b> <b>setups,</b> to simulate its static and dynamic behaviour. Structural <b>test</b> <b>setups</b> consist out of three main systems, the hydraulic system, mechanical system and control system. Currently design of the mechanical system and hydraulic system takes place in separate processes. Controller parameters are tuned when the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> is built and in operation. As a result the total system performance is currently only known if the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> is actually built. To improve design and performance of structural <b>test</b> <b>setups</b> a virtual <b>testing</b> methodology has been developed. The virtual testing methodology combines mechanical, hydraulic and control system in a simulation model to simulate the system performance of the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> before it is built, called virtual testing. To develop and to verify the proposed virtual testing methodology a demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> is developed. This demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> is derived form the general architecture of structural <b>test</b> <b>setups.</b> Assumptions regarding the modelling where made to obtain a demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> which represents the essence of a general structural <b>test</b> <b>setup.</b> Reference signals used in fatigue tests are interpolated sinusoidal signals, therefore dynamic modelling of the demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> is applied. To obtain a measure of the bandwidth of fatigue reference signals, the frequency content of fatigue profiles where analyzed. This analysis obtained a maximum bandwidth of 5 [Hz]. Dynamic models of the three main systems, the hydraulic system, mechanical system and control system were developed and coupled, describing the system behaviour of a demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup.</b> The control architecture as presently used is implemented in the model. Using the simulation models it is possible to obtain controller parameter and provide also the possibility to investigate non-linear effects, such as play and friction. The simulation models obtain physical knowledge of the system behaviour, which can be analyzed in the time domain or frequency domain. Measurements <b>on</b> the demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> where performed to verify the simulation models. Each component of the demonstration <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> was measured and verified individually. Coupled system measurements where performed for verification of the coupled mechanical, hydraulic and control system.

40|$|High Velocity Impact (HVI) {{testing is}} an {{important}} issue for aircraft certification. Particularly, bird strike is an impact incident with one of the highest kinetic energy an aircraft can experience. To reduce the cost of extensive gas gun testing for new aircraft structures there is growing interest in finite element (FE) simulations of impact damage. However, HVI simulations are not yet fully accepted by aviation authorities as a means of compliance. In order to validate the computational procedures reliable quantitative data are required from gas gun tests for detailed comparison with FE predictions. In order to prepare and validate expensive and complex experiments, numeric simulations are intended. Hence, FE models of a <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> are defined then used for impact analysis. Emphasis is set <b>on</b> studying the <b>test</b> <b>setup,</b> the structure as well as the model parameters. The <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> is an instrumented target support (ITS) which is designed to measure impact pulses by an internal strain bar. In contrast to surface strain gauge measurements applied on sensitive areas of a structure, the strain gauges are applied to the support bars which guide the impact strain pulses assuming uniaxial wave propagation. Thus, structural deformation is not monitored locally but quantitative measurements of dynamic load pulses acting on structures during gas gun tests are intended. Here, test results of bird pulse measurement with the ITS are evaluated and used to correlate with simulations.
