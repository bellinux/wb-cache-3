25|$|In computers, {{the main}} numeral systems {{are based on}} the {{positional}} system in base2 (binary numeral system), with two binary digits, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three (<b>octal</b> <b>numeral</b> system) or four (hexadecimal numeral system) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases232 or 264 (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the machine word) are used, as, for example, in GMP.|$|E
25|$|Binary is also easily {{converted}} to the <b>octal</b> <b>numeral</b> system, since octal uses a radix of 8, {{which is a}} power of two (namely, 23, so it takes exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals {{is the same as}} for the first eight digits of hexadecimal in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.|$|E

50|$|Octal {{games are}} {{impartial}} meaning that every move available to one player {{is also available}} to the other player.They differ {{from each other in}} the numbers of tokens that may be removed in a single move, and (depending on this number) whether it is allowed to remove an entire heap, reduce the size of a heap, or split a heap into two heaps. These rule variations may be described compactly by a coding system using <b>octal</b> <b>numerals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} <b>octal</b> and {{hexadecimal}} <b>numeral</b> systems, quaternary {{has a special}} relation to the binary numeral system. Each radix 4, 8 and 16 is a power of 2, so the conversion to and from binary is implemented by matching each digit with 2, 3 or 4 binary digits, or bits. For example, in base 4, ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>octal</b> <b>numeral</b> system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, {{and uses}} the digits 0 to 7. Octal numerals {{can be made from}} binary numerals by {{grouping}} consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right). For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010. Two zeroes can be added at the left: (00)1 001 010, corresponding the octal digits 1 1 2, yielding the octal representation 112.|$|E

5000|$|The common numeral {{systems in}} {{computer}} science are binary (radix 2), octal (radix 8), and hexadecimal (radix 16). In binary only digits [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1" [...] are in the numerals. In the octal numerals, are the eight digits 0-7. Hex is 0-9 A-F, where the ten numerics retain their usual meaning, and the alphabetics correspond to values 10-15, {{for a total of}} sixteen digits. The numeral [...] "10" [...] is binary numeral [...] "2", <b>octal</b> <b>numeral</b> [...] "8", or hexadecimal numeral [...] "16".|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from being}} a monarch, the King's {{interests}} included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is credited with having invented an <b>octal</b> <b>numeral</b> system, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because all the boxes used for materials such as gunpowder were cubic. According {{to a report by}} contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched a model of his thoughts {{on a piece of paper}} and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later, but has since been lost. Several historians of science suspect that either the multi-talented Emanuel Swedenborg or the brilliant inventor Christopher Polhem - also present at the meeting in Lund - may have been the true inventor behind this feat, or at least a significant contributor.|$|E
