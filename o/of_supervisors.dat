5|$|The {{mayor has}} the {{responsibility}} to enforce all city laws, administer and coordinate city departments and intergovernmental activities, set forth policies and agendas to the Board <b>of</b> <b>Supervisors,</b> and prepare and submit the city budget {{at the end of}} each fiscal year. The mayor has the powers to either approve or veto bills passed by the San Francisco Board <b>of</b> <b>Supervisors,</b> participate in meetings of the Board <b>of</b> <b>Supervisors</b> and its committees, appoint a replacement to fill vacancies in all city elected offices until elections, appoint a member of the Board as acting mayor in his/her absence, and to direct personnels in the case of emergency.|$|E
5|$|Newsom's first {{political}} experience {{came when he}} volunteered for Willie Brown's successful campaign for mayor in 1995. Newsom hosted a private fundraiser at his PlumpJack Café. In 1996, Brown appointed Newsom to a vacant seat on the Parking and Traffic Commission, and he was later {{elected president of the}} commission. In 1997, Brown appointed him to the San Francisco Board <b>of</b> <b>Supervisors</b> seat vacated by Kevin Shelley. At the time, he became the youngest member of San Francisco's board <b>of</b> <b>supervisors</b> and also, like Shelley before him, the board's only heterosexual Caucasian male.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} a new topic in the study <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. Previous measures <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support have focused almost exclusively on availability of that support. In this paper the author introduces a new construct <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. It also investigates the relationship between use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support and the Big Five personality traits. Utilizing a cross-sectional research design, the author surveyed 227 (useable surveys) adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The findings suggest that use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support is distinct from the availability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. Use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support was negatively associated with subordinate???s perceptions of workplace stressors (e. g. organizational constraints & interpersonal conflict at work), while also negatively associated with negative job affect while controlling for the availability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support. These results provide evidence that use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support is an important construct in the supervisor-subordinate relationship. Regarding the relationship between use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support and personality, agreeableness was the only personality trait associated with both use of emotional and instrumental supervisor support while controlling for all Big Five Personality traits. Conscientiousness was also uniquely associated with use <b>of</b> instrumental <b>supervisor</b> support, but not use <b>of</b> emotional <b>supervisor</b> support. In conclusion, use <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support can be a considered an important addition to organizational research and the understanding <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support...|$|R

Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed.

5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board <b>of</b> <b>supervisors</b> proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E
40|$|The {{professional}} {{supervision of}} new graduates to ensure both their effectiveness with clients and their personal learning and {{development is a}} common feature {{of a range of}} human services contexts. This study investigated psychology supervisees' perceptions of relationship processes and outcomes in professional supervision. The relationship constructs <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support, challenge and openness were investigated and related to the outcome variables of supervisee anxiety and perceived effectiveness of supervision. Psychology graduates (n= 261) involved in the process of professional supervision for registration responded to a mail survey regarding the quality of their supervisory relationship. Findings established the relationship dimensions <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> challenge, supervisor support and supervisor openness as independent but related constructs. Supervisees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> support and openness predicted their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> effectiveness. Supervisees' perceptions <b>of</b> level <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> challenge predicted their self-reported levels of evaluative anxiety or defensiveness in the supervisory process.

5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board <b>of</b> <b>Supervisors</b> becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy and finish the previous mayoral term. (In the case that both the president of the Board <b>of</b> <b>Supervisors</b> and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E

Multiple regression analysis showed that an interaction effect <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> satisfaction and cooperativeness signiﬁcantly predicted workers’psychological stress as well as self-directedness, social support, and role overload. With a low level of cooperativeness, workers with a low level <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> satisfaction reported more psychological stress than those with a high level <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> satisfaction.

This study examined the generalizability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor</b> ratings <b>of</b> counselors-in-training Participants included 23 counselor trainees enrolled in a masters level prepracticum course and 9 doctoral-level counseling <b>supervisors.</b> Ratings <b>of</b> counselor and <b>supervisor</b> effectiveness were collecteM through the use of the Counselor Effectiveness Scale. At the beginning of the term, practicum trainees were randomly assigned to supervisors. Each prepracticum counselor audictaped a counseling session with a volunteer client on each of 6 weeks. Within a week following each counseling session, counselors met with their supervisor 3 for a 60 minute supervision session. Following each supervision session, the supervisor rated the effectiveness of the counselor, and the counselor rated the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>supervisor.</b> Generalizability analyses were performed. Results showed generalizability <b>of</b> <b>supervisor's</b> ratings <b>of</b> counselor effectiveness were affected more by the number of occasions on which the counselor was rated than by the length of the rating inztrument.
