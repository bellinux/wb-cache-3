25|$|Prior to 1999, {{the game}} {{continued}} as normal until one family reached the necessary total to win. Since then, if neither team reaches the goal after four rounds (or, from 1999 to 2002, if both teams were tied {{with the same}} score after the final round), <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> is played for triple value with only the #1 answer displayed.|$|E

25|$|Round 5 {{features}} quick-fire toss-up questions, each worth +/-20 points. Visual {{questions are}} worth +/-30 points. The {{number of questions}} varies depending on the time left in the game. The game ends when the buzzer sounds, home viewers may realise that the game will come to a close while the countdown clock appears on the television screen. If a team has buzzed in prior the buzzer sounding, the team is required {{to answer the question}} before the game is considered over. If there is a tie in the knockout round (e.g. the final), the presenter may ask <b>one</b> <b>last</b> tie-breaker <b>question</b> to determine the winner.|$|R

But there are certain points to which that statement does not refer. Did Anne Catherick see Miss Fairlie?" ...|$|R
50|$|Conrad {{suffers a}} setback when he learns that Karen (Dinah Manoff), {{a friend of}} his from the {{psychiatric}} hospital, has committed suicide. A cathartic breakthrough session with Dr. Berger allows Conrad to stop blaming himself for Buck's death and accept his mother's frailties. Calvin, however, emotionally confronts Beth <b>one</b> <b>last</b> time. He <b>questions</b> their love and asks whether she is capable of truly loving anyone. Stunned, Beth decides to flee her family rather than deal with her own, or their, emotions. Calvin and Conrad are left {{to come to terms with}} their new family situation.|$|R

5000|$|If, {{by the end}} of the set of 10 callers, {{questions}} remained and {{the final}} question has not been asked, a new set of callers were lined up over the break. If the final question has been asked, but was not correctly answered, the quiz entered a penalty shoot out. (This was usually implemented when the show was running short on time.) In this situation, rather than lining up 10 callers, listeners were asked to keep calling and one caller was picked off the switchboard at random after the break. This was to make it fair because the listeners have time to look up the correct answer. This [...] "Shoot out" [...] method had rarely been used in the quiz's more recent times. On <b>one</b> occasion, the <b>last</b> <b>question</b> of the quiz was not answered before the show's end, so it was finished the following day.|$|R

40|$|There are {{literally}} thousands of shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. Near the eastern coast of Wisconsin, hundreds of these wrecks lay {{on the bottom of}} Lake Michigan. This paper examines the shipwrecked sailing vessels of Wisconsin's Lake Michigan in order to answer three main questions. First, what were the most common causes for ships in this region to go down? Second, are any parts of the lake more dangerous than other? Finally, how do these ships appear in the archaeological record? The first question has been answered through an in-depth analysis of the Wisconsin State Historical Society's shipwreck database. The second question is addressed by looking at these wrecks spatially in comparison to ports and to <b>one</b> another. The <b>last</b> <b>question</b> is answered through a detailed study of three previously excavated/explored wrecks and two unexcavated shipwrecks. Predictions about the two unexcavated wrecks are then made based on their correlations and similarities with the previously excavated wrecks. One of the most important conclusions discovered in this research is how a ship's cargo can break a vessel apart as it sinks, thus causing a large debris field on the lake bottom...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{discovery}} at Jupiter in 1988, emission from HGraphic {{has been}} used as a valuable diagnostic tool in our understanding of the upper atmospheres of the giant planets. <b>One</b> of the <b>lasting</b> <b>questions</b> we have about the giant planets is why the measured upper atmosphere temperatures are always consistently hotter than the temperatures expected from solar heating alone. Here, we describe how HGraphic forms across each of the planetary disks of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, presenting the first observations of equatorial HGraphic at Saturn and the first profile of HGraphic emission at Uranus not significantly distorted by the effects of the Earth's atmosphere. We also review past observations of variations in temperature measured at Uranus and Jupiter over a wide variety of time scales. To this, we add new observations of temperature changes at Saturn, using observations by Cassini. We conclude that the causes of the significant level of thermal variability observed over all three planets is not only an important question in itself, but that explaining these variations could be the key to answering the more general question of why giant planet upper atmospheres are so hot...|$|R

2500|$|On 30 May 2007, Spicks and Specks {{celebrated its}} 100th episode. Instead {{of the show}} being divided into rounds, teams were asked 100 {{questions}} – one {{from each of the}} previous 99 episodes, and one new question, [...] "What is the <b>last</b> <b>question</b> on our 100th episode?" [...] which was correctly answered: [...] "What is the <b>last</b> <b>question</b> on our 100th episode." [...] by Antoinette Halloran. Alan Brough's team was victorious although it did come down to the very <b>last</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R

60|$|<b>One</b> <b>last</b> <b>question.</b> How does it {{come that}} in these {{southern}} climates the hill-top town has survived so much more generally to our own day than in Northern Europe? The obvious answer seems at first sight to be that in the warmer climates life can be carried on comfortably, and agriculture can yield good results, at a greater height than in a cold climate. Olives, vines, chestnuts, maize will grow far up on Italian hill sides, and that, no doubt, counts for something; but I {{do not believe it}} covers all the ground. Two other points seem to me at least equally important, especially when we remember that the hill-top town was once as common in the north as in the south, and that what we have really to account for in Italy is not its existence merely, but rather its late survival into newer epochs. One point is that in Southern Europe the state of perpetual internal warfare lasted much longer than in the feudal north. The other point is that each little patch of country in the south is still far more self-supporting, has had its economic conditions far less disturbed by modern rearrangements and commercial necessities, than in Northern Europe. In England every town and village stands upon some high road; the larger stand almost invariably upon some railway or some navigable river. In Italy it is still quite possible, where agricultural conditions are favourable, to have a comparatively flourishing town perched upon some out-of-the-way mountain height. Even a carriage road is scarcely a necessity; a mule path will do well enough for wine and oil and the other simple commodities of southern life. The hill-top town, in short, belongs to an earlier type of civilisation than ours; it survives, unaltered, on its own pinnacle wherever that type of civilisation is still possible.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the three}} questions, the winning team played a round called [...] "Celebrity Turnabout".
