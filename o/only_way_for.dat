5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{time and}} disorder within nature {{that is the}} result of humanity following only science and not the divine. Leaders are described as materialistic and unable to understand reality. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> mankind to find salvation is through pursuing the divine by looking inwards and realizing that humanity is interconnected. Only then can people understand the universe.|$|E

Alyx contacts Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city, and is informed the Citadel's core is at risk of exploding at any moment. Kleiner states the explosion could {{be large enough to}} level the whole of City 17, and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> them to survive is to re-enter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown. Eli reluctantly agrees when he sees no other option.|$|E

In the first season, Lana and Clark's {{friendship}} is just beginning, as she is dating Whitney Fordman during this time. After Whitney leaves for the Marines in the season one finale, Lana and Clark slowly begin to try to start a romantic relationship. In season seven, Lana leaves Smallville, leaving behind a DVD explaining to Clark that, even though she loves him, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> him to help {{the world to the}} best of his ability would be if she left him and Smallville for good.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of}} the place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn {{the concept of a}} dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Locating the armillary {{building}} in Egypt {{with the three}} stone keys, George and Nico sneak into the building, only to see Susarro forcing Bruno to activate the armillary. As it powers up, George and Nico subdue Susarro, just before Petra arrives with a hooded man seen twice before during their adventure, who proceeds to kill Susarro with supernatural powers. The figure {{turns out to be}} the Grand Master of the Neo-Templars, thought to have been killed back in Bannockburn, but had survived, having Petra work with Susarro until he learnt what the Grand Master needed. With the armillary active and the location of a large power site displayed, the Grand Master sets off dynamite in the building as he escapes with Petra, trapping George, Nico, and Bruno inside and killing Flap. The group find the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> them to escape is for one of them to sacrifice themselves in one of the puzzle rooms, forcing Bruno to take the responsibility, hoping to atone for past sins so that George and Nico can stop the Grand Master.|$|E
5|$|Seeking vengeance for Kureha's death, Ryu learns from Murai {{that the}} raiders were from Vigoor, so he stows away on an airship {{bound for the}} empire. Fighting {{his way through the}} streets of its capital city, Tairon, Ryu faces several bosses {{including}} the three Greater Fiends. He defeats Alma in a battle that wrecks the city, but leaves her to Rachel's mercy. Conversely, Rachel cannot bring herself to kill her sister, and instead is taken by Doku, who prepares to sacrifice her in a ritual to enhance Alma's power. With Alma's help Ryu rescues Rachel and destroys Doku's spirit, but with his dying breath Doku casts the blood curse on Ryu. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Ryu to lift the curse is to kill the emperor, so he storms the palace, defeating Marbus who bars his way to the emperor's personal realm. Two successive boss fights must be completed to destroy the Emperor and reclaim the Dark Dragon Blade—once this is accomplished his realm starts to destruct. Ryu must then be maneuvered up a series of ledges to escape, but in the process he loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Haiti {{started with}} the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1492. The {{practice}} was devastating to the native population. Following the indigenous Taino's near decimation from forced labour, disease and war, the Spanish, under advisement of the Catholic priest Bartolomeu de las Casas, and with the blessing of the Catholic church began engaging in earnest in the kidnapped and forced labour of enslaved Africans. During the French colonial period beginning in 1625, the economy of Haiti (then known as Saint-Domingue) was based on slavery, and the practice there was regarded as the most brutal in the world. The Haitian Revolution of 1804, the only successful slave revolt in human history, precipitated the end of slavery not only in Saint-Domingue, but in all French colonies. However, several Haitian leaders following the revolution employed forced labor, believing a plantation-style economy was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Haiti to succeed, and building fortifications to safeguard against attack by the French. During the U.S. occupation between 1915 and 1934, the U.S. military forced Haitians to work building roads for defense against Haitian resistance fighters.|$|E

5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
