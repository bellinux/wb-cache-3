5|$|Due to its {{location}} in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape {{of the city was}} complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, {{probably due to the}} resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The Somerset Coal Canal and Wilts & Berks Canal, {{which each}} {{supplied}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> from the Somerset Coalfield to the Kennet and Avon, closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. In 1926, following {{a loss of}} £18,041 the previous year, the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal. Cargo trade continued to decline, but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became clogged with weed, and the railway took much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700. Three years later, the Bristol and Exeter Railway {{merged with the}} Great Western Railway. The new owners were remote, and {{were more interested in}} the water supply for Taunton station and for the Bridgwater Dock, than running the canal as a going concern, with the result that the canal deteriorated further. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, but had little hope of any improvements being made.|$|E

40|$|Incorporating {{explicitly}} {{division of}} labor into a two-country general oligopolistic equilibrium model, we examine the firm productivity effect of trade liberalization and its welfare implication. We show that a tariff reduction increases <b>the</b> firm productivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> industries but decreases that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-trading industries. An expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> industries, in contrast, decreases <b>the</b> firm productivity <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> and non-trading industries.

5|$|The present {{town was}} {{established}} in 1764 by the General Trade Company as the trading post of Holsteinsborg ("Fort Holstein"), named for the first chairman of the Danish College of Missions in Copenhagen which underwrote and directed the missionary work in the colony.
