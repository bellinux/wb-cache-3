40|$|The {{manner in}} which the Canterbury {{settlement}} was founded has stimulated many historical enquiries and the zenith of this interest was reached in our centennial year. Much of the ground has been covered time and time again, because the story is one of a whole plan unfolding. Every aspect of Canterbury's early history takes the purpose of the founders as its reference point and this is particularly so in the question of immigration control. To reach my conclusions I have had to follow where many more able have led, before branching out on my specific enquiry. The scope for original research in this topic is narrow and I {{have not been able to}} bring forward very much new evidence. At the outset I planned to review immigration control for the period 1850 - 1875, but when I discovered that extant shipping lists covered most of the immigrant ships from England for the years 1850 - 1853, and little more, I decided to concentrate on the period of Association control. In the first two chapters I had to use many secondary sources of information and this I found rather tedious and unsatisfying. I could not lay my hands on really vital information concerning the land purchasers, especially those who entered Canterbury from the neighbouring settlements. My figures for the land purchasers are estimated from limited information as are my inferences concerning the economic status of the shagroons in Canterbury. I enjoyed writing Chapters III and IV. The real evidence was readily at hand - all written in the ornate script of the period - and in each bundle of papers there was something new and interesting. My case would have been enormously strengthened had the application forms of steerage passengers been available. From these forms I could have discovered the areas from which the steerage immigrants were drawn, exactly how many of the were nominated and on what references, (if any) the Association based its selections. It seems merely a happy chance that there is extant a list which gives the 'home' addresses of some of the land purchasers. Although this thesis gives us a statistical survey of Association immigration, I was always more interested in the personalities whom I cam to know as I delved into <b>old</b> <b>correspondence.</b> The impressions that I gained lent an atmosphere of reality to the work of research. I formed views on topics that had little relation to my specific enquiry, an example being the Godley-Thomas dispute. It was in this question that I discovered the importance of personal bias in the writing of history. Before I read the evidence (and after) I warmly supported Thomas. At this point I feel bound to make a confession. As a descendant of a family who landed in Canterbury in 1850 I have prejudices concerning some of the values that have been handed down from those early days. When I started this thesis my bias caused me to be very sceptical of the Association and all its works. I pounced gleefully on its shortcomings and, even now, I think that my praise for its good points was rather grudging. I have tried in this work, to trace all the forces that controlled immigration into Canterbury before and during the period in which the Canterbury Association had the destiny of the settlement in its grasp. I have outlined the Association's hopes for the settlement and have commented on their desirability in a New Zealand context. The Association wished to make Canterbury a cut above the rest of New Zealand and I have narrated its course of action and analysed the results. My main questions were directed at the aims and achievements of the colonising body. The habits that characterise a mature society are hard to acquire and are easily lost. It is my opinion that, despite its many failings, the Association was successful in transplanting a culture of quality; a culture strong enough to transcend the impact upon it of a typical colonial environment...|$|E
40|$|Whe' yu' from?" The {{question}} {{was put to}} me as I wandered, camera in hand, in the old square of Spanish Town, Jamaica's former capital. The local man, lounging {{in the shade of}} one of the colonial Georgian buildings that enclose the square, was mildly curious about what he took to be a typical white tourish photgraphing the sights of the decayed historic town. At that time, my home was in Kingston where i lived with my wife and baby son. I was then working in the Jamaican Government Town Planning Department in a job that took me all over the island. Turning to my questioner, I replied, "Kingston". There was a brief pause, and then the man spoke again: "No Man! Whe' yu' really from?" I still have difficulties when asked this question. Where am I from? What does this question mean? Does it refer to where I was born, where I spent my previous life or where I live now? Does it have a broader meaning, an enquiry about my origins in terms of background and previous experience? The following chapters are my attempt to answer these questions for my own satisfaction and, I hope, for the amusement of others who may be interested in the life of an ordinary English boy whose dream to travel and see the world was realized in ways he could not possibly have imagined. Finding an appropriate title for this book was difficult. Thursday's Child, North and South and War and Peace all came to mind but, unfortunately for me, those titles had been appropriated by other writers. Thursdays's Child is quite a popular book title, presumably because people who were born on that day and, {{in the words of the}} nursery rhyme, had 'far to go', are especially likely to have travellers' tales to tell or life stories of the rags-to-riches variety. Born on a Thursday, I have travelled a lot and I suppose that I have gone far in life. Coming from a working class family, I 'got on' by 'getting a good education' and a 'good job'. I decided against adding to the list of Thursday's Children. North and South would have reflected my life in Britain, spent in both the North and South of England, and my later years, divided between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of the globe, as well as in countries commonly referred to as the 'advanced' North and the 'underdeveloped' South. North and South has already been appropriated by Mrs Gaskell, something that did not deter one popular American writer from using the title for a book of his. My memories of World War Two and the years afterwards made War and Peace a possible candidate, but readers expectnig an epic tale of Tolstoyan proportions may have been disappointed. To my knowledge, no other book has the title "Whe' Yu' From?". I am grateful to the Jamaican man whose question lingered in my memory and provided the title of this memoir, written decades later. This book is a word picture. It is, in a sense, a self-portrait, and like all portraits, it captures something of the character, it attempts to tell the truth, but it is not the whole truth. This is because it is not my intention to write my entire life story; rather I wish to tell about some of the things in my experience of life that have seemed important or interesting to me. Unlike a painted portrait, the picture I have created is intended to suggest the passage of time. While, for most of us in Western society, time is linear and unidirectional, like the flight of an arrov or the trajectory of a bullet, memory rearranges things, calling up images of the past in no particular order, making connections that may link events in various patterns, circular, web-like, superimposed. The stream of consciousness is very unlike that of streams we encounter in the physical world. Connections are made in all directions; thoughts hop back and forth in time and space, from topic to topic. My book is a composition drawn from periods, events and thoughts as I remember them. Like life itself, it is made up of patches, some good, some bad, but in my experience, always fascinating. In recording my memories, I have been as accurate as possible. Little of what I have written is about spectacular sights and strange customs. Much of it focuses on my more modest explorations includng observations of everyday things that have attracted my attention. Reading through the chapters, I am struck by my childhood freedom to roam and engage in 'dangerous' activities like climbing trees and playing beside streams, things that many children today are no longer allowed to enjoy. Also noticeable is the survival of traditions and superstitions from the distant past. Obvious too, is my preoccupation with place names, both official ones that appear on maps and sign boards and those used by locals and children, names rarely seen in print. If there is any uniting theme to be found in what I have written, it must be my education in the fields, woods and streets of my English homeland, in the various other countries in which I have lived and travelled, as well as more formally from books and in classrooms. Much of my book is concerned with people and places. Many of the people I mention are among those who have been, and often have remained, important and close to me. Others I remember from only the briefest of encounters, but they remain in my memory because of some specific incident or circumstance that fixed a lasting image in my mind. Some of my closest friends and relatives, however, appear nowhere in these pages or they receive only the slightest mention. This is not because they played an unimportant roles in my life. It is because this book is not the whole story. Among those whe receive little or no mention are some who are especially close to me, with whom I have shared happy and sad times and who have shown me and my family much kindness, giving support when this was needed. Some I have known since childhood and have popped up at various times in my life, often in different parts of the world. Although years may pass without me seeing them, in an important sense they are always with me. These people know who they are. I hope that they know how much I love and appreciate them. When writing my memoir, I consulted a few of the people mentioned in this book, but in the main, I have relied on my own memory, asided by daiary and notebook entries and <b>old</b> <b>correspondence.</b> In the preparation of this manuscript, I benefited greatly from the expert advice and encouragement of Neil Marr of BeWrite Books. My wife Anne, inspiration for this book, also contributed in the valuable role of critic. She has my undying gratitude. ...|$|E
60|$|I, for one, do {{more than}} doubt the policy {{of this kind of}} {{convention}} with Algiers. On those who think as I do the argument ad hominem can make no sort of impression. I know something of the constitution and composition of this very extraordinary republic. It has a constitution, I admit, similar to the present tumultuous military tyranny of France, by which an handful of obscure ruffians domineer over a fertile country and a brave people. For the composition, too, I admit the Algerine community resembles that of France,--being formed out of the very scum, scandal, disgrace, and pest of the Turkish Asia. The Grand Seignior, to disburden the country, suffers the Dey to recruit in his dominions the corps of janizaries, or asaphs, which form the Directory and Council of Elders of the African Republic one and indivisible. But notwithstanding this resemblance, which I allow, I never shall so far injure the Janizarian Republic of Algiers as to put it in comparison, for every sort of crime, turpitude, and oppression, with the Jacobin Republic of Paris. There is no question with me to which of the two I should choose to be a neighbor or a subject. But. situated as I am, I am in no danger of becoming to Algiers either the one or the other. It is not so in my relation to the atheistical fanatics of France. I am their neighbor; I may become their subject. Have the gentlemen who borrowed this happy parallel no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the very same evil at an immense distance and when it is at your door? when its power is enormous, as when it is comparatively as feeble as its distance is remote? when there is a barrier of language and usages, which prevents corruption through certain <b>old</b> <b>correspondences</b> and habitudes, from the contagion of the horrible novelties that are introduced into everything else? I can contemplate without dread a royal or a national tiger on the borders of Pegu. I can look at him with an easy curiosity, as prisoner within bars in the menagerie of the Tower. But if, by Habeas Corpus, or otherwise, he was to come into the lobby of the House of Commons whilst your door was open, any of you would be more stout than wise who would not gladly make your escape out of the back windows. I certainly should dread more from a wild-cat in my bedchamber than from all the lions that roar in the deserts behind Algiers. But in this parallel it is the cat that is at a distance, and the lions and tigers that are in our antechambers and our lobbies. Algiers is not near; Algiers is not powerful; Algiers is not our neighbor; Algiers is not infectious. Algiers, whatever it may be, is an old creation; and we have good data to calculate all the mischief to be apprehended from it. When I find Algiers transferred to Calais, I will tell you what I think of that point. In the mean time, the case quoted from the Algerine Reports will not apply as authority. We shall put it out of court; and so far as that goes, let the counsel for the Jacobin peace take nothing by their motion.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} multicolour imaging data of {{a complete}} sample of 19 low redshift (z < 0. 2) quasar host galaxies. The sample was imaged in four optical (BVRi) and three near-infrared bands (JHKs). Galaxy types, structural parameters and robust host galaxy luminosities are extracted for all bands by means of two-dimensional deblending of galaxy and nucleus. For the disc dominated fraction of host galaxies (Sa and later) the optical and optical-to-NIR colours agree well with the average colours of inactive galaxies of same type. The bulge dominated galaxies (E/S 0) {{on the other hand}} appear a significant 0. 35 mag bluer in (V − K) than their inactive counterparts, being as blue as the discs in the sample. This trend is confirmed by fitting population synthesis models to the extracted broad band SEDs: the stellar population age of the bulge dominated hosts lies around a few Gyr, much younger than expected for old evolved ellipticals. Comparison to other studies suggests a strong trend for stellar age in elliptical host galaxies with luminosity. Intermediately luminous elliptical hosts have comparably young populations, either intrinsically or from an enhanced star formation rate potentially due to interaction, the most luminous and massive ellipticals on the contrary show <b>old</b> populations. The <b>correspondence</b> between the nuclear activity and the blue colours suggests a connection between galaxy interaction, induced star formation and the triggering of nuclear activity.

The study draws on historical data from settlers 2 ̆ 7 diaries, official <b>correspondence,</b> <b>old</b> newspapers and early cartographic material. Under separate headings it examines: The archaeological evidence for human involvement with the region; the potential food resources, including anadromous fish; European accounts of Aboriginal exploitation of the fishery resource and the associated environment; the historical accounts of European visitations to the fishery and environs,· the colonial exploitation of the fishery resource and associated environment and finally, Aboriginal-European conflict issues which involved the fishery resource and environs. The appendices contain maps, charts, tables and photographs of some species which are discussed. The conclusion of the study is that there was no direct intercultural competition for the fish resources of the estuary, but that European settlers had an impact on other faunal species such waterfowl and kangaroos. Aborigines made certain modifications to their foraging strategies as the colonisation process enveloped them, but based on theoretical calculations, intercultural violence appears to have played a major role in reducing the Aboriginal population by between 17...|$|R
