25|$|In Lebanon, the {{government}} sponsored the first training {{of school counselors}} for public {{elementary and middle schools}} in 1996. There are now school counselors in about 1/5 of the elementary and middle schools in Lebanon and none in the high schools. They have been trained in delivering preventive, developmental, and remedial services. Private schools have some school counselors serving all grade levels but the focus is exclusively individual counseling and primarily remedial. Challenges include regular violence and wartime strife and not enough resources and a lack of a professional school counseling organization, assignment of school counselors to cover more than one school at a time, and only two school counseling graduate programs in the country.

2500|$|From the 1920s to the 1930s, school {{counseling}} [...] grew {{because of the}} rise of progressive education in schools. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, led to a decline in {{school counseling}}. In the 1940s, psychologists and counselors selected, recruited, and trained military personnel. This propelled the school counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, Carl Rogers' emphasis on helping relationships and a move away from directive [...] "guidance" [...] to nondirective or person-centered [...] "counseling" [...] influenced the profession <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>counseling.</b>|$|E
