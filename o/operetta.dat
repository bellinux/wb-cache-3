5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, stiff competition was present in the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German <b>operetta</b> composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the <b>operetta</b> field.|$|E

5|$|After {{the premiere}} of Trial by Jury in 1875, <b>operetta</b> {{companies}} in London, the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French <b>operetta.</b> The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. It was even translated into German, and premièred as Im Schwurgericht, at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886, and as Das Brautpaar vor Gericht at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.|$|E

25|$|Virtually {{eliminated}} from the English-speaking stage by competition from the ubiquitous Edwardian musical comedies, <b>operettas</b> returned to London and Broadway in 1907 with The Merry Widow, and adaptations of continental <b>operettas</b> became direct competitors with musicals. Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus composed new <b>operettas</b> that were popular in English until World War I. In America, Victor Herbert produced a string of enduring <b>operettas</b> including The Fortune Teller (1898), Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle. Modiste (1905), The Red Mill (1906) and Naughty Marietta (1910).|$|R
5000|$|A Capitol Records album {{starring}} Gordon MacRae {{was issued}} {{as part of}} a series of recordings based on MacRae's popular Railroad Hour program, which featured potted <b>operettas</b> and musicals.

This version was issued on CD in 2008 along with selections from The Red Mill and Sweethearts.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of François les bas-bleus, Messager received, and accepted, {{simultaneous}} invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an <b>operetta</b> for the Folies-Dramatiques. The <b>operetta,</b> La fauvette du temple, first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, {{and he was able}} to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, Les deux pigeons, which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police authorities, and the production was temporarily shelved.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how {{directly}} Offenbach influenced Johann Strauss. He had encouraged Strauss to turn to <b>operetta</b> when they met in Vienna in 1864, {{but it was not until}} seven years later that Strauss did so. However, Offenbach's operettas were well established in Vienna, and Strauss worked on the lines established by his French colleague; in 1870s Vienna, an <b>operetta</b> composer who did not do so was quickly called to order by the press. In Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to London, Carte formed a new {{partnership}} with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows. Meanwhile, Pinafore continued to play strongly. On 20 February 1880, Pinafore completed its initial run of 571performances. Only one other work of musical theatre in the world had ever run longer, Robert Planquette's <b>operetta</b> Les cloches de Corneville.|$|E
5|$|Offenbach's later <b>operettas</b> enjoyed renewed {{popularity}} in France, especially Madame Favart (1878), which featured a fantasy plot about the real-life French actress Marie Justine Favart, and La fille du tambour-major (1879), {{which was the}} most successful of his <b>operettas</b> of the 1870s.|$|R

5000|$|Félix Marie Henri Tilkin (12 May 1861 [...] - [...] 29 November 1921), {{better known}} by his pen name Ivan Caryll, was a Belgian {{composer}} of <b>operettas</b> and Edwardian musical comedies in the English language. He composed (or contributed to) some forty musical comedies and <b>operettas.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1858, the {{government}} lifted the licensing {{restrictions on the}} number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious works. His first full-length <b>operetta,</b> Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these literary sources, various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works, especially Jacques Offenbach's <b>operetta</b> Le voyage dans la lune (an unauthorized parody of Verne's novels) and the A Trip to the Moon attraction at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesizes that Méliès drew upon both of these works, but in different ways: {{he appears to have}} taken the structure of the film—"a trip to the moon, a moon landing, an encounter with extraterrestrials with a deformity, an underground trek, an interview with the Man in the Moon, and a brutal return to reality back on earth"—directly from the 1901 attraction, but also incorporated many plot elements (including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo-scientific names, telescopes that transform into stools, a moonshot cannon mounted above ground, a scene in which the moon appears to approach the viewer, a lunar snowstorm, an earthrise scene, and umbrella-wielding travelers), not to mention the parodic tone of the film, from the Offenbach <b>operetta.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later in 1954 Donen made Deep in My Heart, a {{biography}} of the Hungarian-born American <b>operetta</b> composer Sigmund Romberg starring José Ferrer. The film included cameos by many MGM contract actors, including the only screen pairing of Gene Kelly and his brother Fred. Although it received mediocre reviews, Romberg's cult status and popularity helped make the film a hit financially.|$|E

5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view.

5|$|Even {{after the}} initial {{production}} of Trial by Jury, however, Carte continued to produce continental <b>operetta,</b> touring {{in the summer of}} 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s La Périchole, and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and Léon Vasseur's La Timbale d'argent), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury).

Its gigantic toy soldiers became members of the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Christmas Parades.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, {{who owned}} a Yiddish theater there, {{was glad to have}} a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based on the life of Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an <b>operetta</b> Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E

25|$|Herbert {{began to}} compose <b>operettas</b> in 1894, {{producing}} several successes, including The Serenade (1897) and The Fortune Teller (1898).

After World War I, with the change of popular musical tastes, Herbert began to compose musicals and contributed music to other composers' shows.
