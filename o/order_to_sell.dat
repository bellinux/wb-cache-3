5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Jen Kamerman {{and was the first}} episode Dana Gould wrote for The Simpsons. Gould based the part about Homer's bar on his own father, who opened a hunting club in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> alcohol without having to acquire a liquor license. The episode featured the musical group R.E.M., who appeared as themselves. It received mixed reviews from critics following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E

5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E
5|$|While {{writing of}} Afonso de Albuquerque's ventures in Sumatra, João de Barros {{noted that the}} Chinese {{were the first to}} control trade between Sumatra and India, and noted the {{presence}} of Chinese people living in Sumatra. Barros also noted that while Fernão Pires was loading Southeast Asian spices onto his ship in Pacem (a kingdom in Sumatra) in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> or present them as gifts in China, two different kings were killed and their position usurped. Apparently the usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state, as Barros noted any leader there was believed by the locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman. Historian Mark Dion notes that Fernão related the same story in his writing, only adding that a Muslim in their society was the only acceptable replacement as ruler.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that one who exercises a put option, does not necessarily need to own the underlying asset. Specifically, one does not need to own the underlying stock in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it. The reason for this is that one can short sell that underlying stock.|$|E

50|$|Ambrose McGuirk was {{the first}} owner of the Milwaukee Badgers of the National Football League. He {{is best known for}} being <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Badgers {{for his role in the}} 1925 Chicago Cardinals-Milwaukee Badgers scandal, in which four Chicago-area high school {{football}} players were employed by the Badgers for one game, a 59-0 loss against the Chicago Cardinals. When the scandal was discovered by NFL president Joe Carr, McGuirk was <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> his Milwaukee franchise within 90 days. However Carr later decided that the penalty on McGuirk was too harsh and rescinded his earlier order. However by this time McGuirk had already sold the franchise to Chicago Bears fullback, Johnny Bryan.|$|R

Contributions by either partner to property improvement are recognised if the contributions are substantial and in actual money or money's worth.|$|E
25|$|The second Canadian {{sweetening}} plant {{followed a}} year later in Turner Valley, and used the same process. The first gas found at Turner Valley had been sweet but the Royalite #4 discovery of 1924, from a deeper horizon, was sour.

25|$|Three sets of train crew, being driver, fireman {{and guard}} (one fireman's post {{was not being}} filled). The drivers did not work off the EKLR. The guard {{occupied}} the brake compartment in the passenger carriage, did the shunting at unstaffed stations and sold tickets. The published assertion {{that he had to}} clamber along the outside of the carriage in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> tickets while the train was moving is unbelievable, and needs confirmation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{business}} model {{is to give}} away the software in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> hardware. This {{used to be the}} norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as CP/M, Apple DOS and versions of Mac OS prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.|$|E
25|$|But how, {{one might}} ask, is this still {{thriving}} given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec’s “Internet Security Threat Report”, {{is that of}} the expanding “underground economy”. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this “underground economy” has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN.|$|E
25|$|Capital gains tax: MPs {{were able}} to {{designate}} a property as their second home with the parliamentary fees office so as to claim the cost of renovating it on expenses, {{but a number of}} MPs had concurrently described a property as their second home to claim expenses, and to the UK tax authority HM Revenue and Customs as their primary residence in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it without capital gains tax. Some also designated a property as a primary or secondary residence for tax or expenses benefits which was apparently little if at all used by them in that role.|$|E

50|$|Toronto Blueshirts {{included}} the {{players from the}} Toronto Shamrocks/Ontarios/Tecumsehs franchise. Before the season, Ed Livingstone, the Shamrocks owner, purchased the Blueshirts franchise from Frank Robinson. At {{the annual meeting of}} November 9, 1915, he was <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Shamrocks franchise but could not do so as the Pacific Coast Hockey Association 'raided' the franchise and signed its players.|$|R
25|$|In {{transactions}} with static assets, a depositor will {{assemble the}} underlying collateral, help structure {{the securities and}} work with the financial markets to sell the securities to investors. The depositor has taken on added significance under Regulation AB. The depositor typically owns 100% of the beneficial interest in the issuing entity and is usually the parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent which initiates the transaction. In transactions with managed (traded) assets, asset managers assemble the underlying collateral, help structure the securities {{and work with the}} financial markets in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the securities to investors.|$|E
25|$|NBC play-by-play {{announcer}} Bob Costas {{believed that}} the fact that a large bulk of the regular season coverage ended up on cable (namely, ESPN) beginning in the 1990s was because CBS, when it took over the MLB the television rights from NBC in 1990, did not really want the Saturday Game of the Week. Many fans who did not appreciate CBS' approach to scheduling regular season baseball games {{believed that the}}y were only truly after the marquee events (namely, the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and the World Series) in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> advertising space (especially the fall entertainment television schedule).|$|E
25|$|Forced {{prostitution}} and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because {{they do not want to}} abandon their child.|$|E

25|$|In May 2008 SNMM {{revealed}} that some time between October 2007 and April 2008 the Dalarö wreck site had been disturbed. Some items {{had been removed}} while others had been disturbed or damaged. Among the objects that have disappeared so far is the wooden frame of a pistol that was located on the weather deck. The ship is monitored by the coast guard, and the residents of Dalarö have been notified {{to be wary of}} attempts to plunder the wreck. As of 2009, objects recorded by archaeologists have disappeared and the wreck has been disturbed and to some extent damaged. Known wreck sites in the Baltic are inevitably plundered, and there have been public appeals to somehow protect the Dalarö wreck. Though illegal, there is little preventing individuals from performing private covert diving operations in order to bring up objects from the ship in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them on the black market.|$|E
25|$|In {{marriage}}, {{there are}} three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses in a marriage {{continue to be the}} property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them, both the husband and wife must sign. In the case of divorce, both the man and woman are entitled to ownership of the marital home. In the case of the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse, regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home. If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as the children for inheritance. Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets.|$|E
25|$|On 11/21 February 1673O.S./N.S. Michael Grabo, Bremen-Verdian land fiscal, {{reported}} to Governor-General Henrik Horn that Bailiff Michael Riedell had removed bricks from dilapidated convent buildings, demolishing even complete structures, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them. Under the Brandenburgian-Lunenburgian occupation (1675–1679) during the Bremen-Verden Campaign billeting (in Himmelpforten mostly Münster troops staying 11 weeks) and requisitioning goods impoverished the area, with most revenues anyway lacking {{as they had}} been already previously deducted for Count Gustaf Mauritz Lewenhaupt/Löwenhaupt (1651–1700), the conventuals did not get their annuities and the convent buildings reached a stage of progressed dilapidation. In 1676 still two conventuals lived in the convent, two lived with relatives, and all the four still claimed their annuities. However, the annuities had not been paid {{since the start of the}} campaign in 1675, leaving the three conventuals still alive in 1677 without any means. All the three had then left the convent after it had been plundered by soldiers in the occupying army.|$|E
50|$|Cambus Holdings Ltd was {{acquired}} by Stagecoach Group in late 1995. An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading concluded that this had led to an unacceptable monopoly of bus operations in Cambridgeshire, Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering, Wellingborough, Bedford and Mid Bedfordshire. Stagecoach was <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Milton Keynes and Huntingdon operations to avoid the deal being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
