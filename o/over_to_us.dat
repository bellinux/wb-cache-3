A Mexican federal judge approved the request the following year, but the drug lord was extradited to the United States on 16 September 2006.

He was then transferred {{to the state of}} California pending federal charges on drug trafficking. On 18 June 2007, he pleaded guilty to the possession and distribution of cocaine before U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez in a San Diego federal court. In his testimony, he admitted to selling about 250 grams of cocaine to a supplier who negotiated with an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in an unnamed motel in San Diego in 1980. In October 2007, Francisco Rafael was sentenced to six years in prison and with possibility to parole in four months given the time he had already served in prison.|$|E

500|$|An Albanian account {{describes}} the dispute as follows: [...] "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did {{everything in its}} power to put under its control this Albanian base which {{at the same time}} served the defence of the socialist countries... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation {{on the part of the}} Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959." [...] In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process. As the Albanian account describes it, [...] "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too." [...] Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet [...] "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either you hand the submarines <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 July 1944, {{following}} the failed 20 July assassination attempt on Hitler's life by German Army officers, Halder {{was arrested by}} the Gestapo. Although he {{was not involved in}} the 20 July plot, intense interrogations of the conspirators revealed that Halder had been involved in earlier conspiracies against Hitler. Halder was imprisoned at both the Flossenbürg and Dachau concentration camps. Halder's wife Gertrud chose to, and was allowed to, accompany her husband into imprisonment. On 31 January 1945, Halder was officially dismissed from the army. His service to Germany during Hitler's reign was plagued by complexity and personal misgivings but his professed role in possible intrigue during his tenure as the Chief of Staff and his survival make for a remarkable story, especially when one considers the plight of others who fell into disfavor or mistrust with Hitler.
