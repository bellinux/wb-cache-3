Our algorithms remain polynomial even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where k=O(logn) <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> where <b>the</b> size of H is O(n).

5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> a two-section filter, by mutual inductance.

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

5|$|Anekāntavāda {{played a}} role in the history of Jainism in India, during {{intellectual}} debates from Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians at various times. According to John Koller, professor of Asian studies, anekāntavāda allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Haribhadra justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.|$|E
5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges {{as a result of the}} movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as survey vessels, training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals in those countries. Starting in 1872, the members of the class began to be withdrawn from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken up <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a naval mine storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

By the same token, predecessors such as Lara Croft Go hid treasures in its background such that players would revisit its levels, but Deus Ex Go had little to interest players besides its primary mission. The game's sole challenge of completing the puzzle in the fewest moves, GameSpot explained, quickly became uninteresting. Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not subvert the themes of its parent series quite like the others.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
5|$|In {{many forms}} of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other {{structural}} elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (<b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related {{to the use of}} interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.|$|E
