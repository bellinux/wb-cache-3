Each of these contains an intron which can be either spliced out or not. Given these possibilities, four various mRNAs, and consequently four various Rep proteins with <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> can be synthesized. Their names depict their sizes in kilodaltons (kDa): Rep78, Rep68, Rep52 and Rep40. Rep78 and 68 can specifically bind the hairpin formed by the ITR in the self-priming act and cleave at a specific region, designated terminal resolution site, within the hairpin. They were also shown to be necessary for the AAVS1-specific integration of the AAV genome. All four Rep proteins were shown to bind ATP and to possess helicase activity. It was also shown that they upregulate the transcription from the p40 promoter (mentioned below), but downregulate both p5 and p19 promoters.|$|E

40|$|Extremely AT-rich DNA {{sequences}} {{present a}} challenging template for specific recognition by RNA polymerase. In bacteria, {{this is because}} the promoter - 10 hexamer, the major DNA element recognised by RNA polymerase, is itself AT-rich. We show that Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring (H-NS) protein can facilitate correct recognition of a promoter by RNA polymerase in AT-rich gene regulatory regions. Thus, at the Escherichia coli ehxCABD operon, RNA polymerase is unable to distinguish between the promoter - 10 element and similar <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequences.</b> This problem is resolved in native nucleoprotein because the <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequences</b> are masked by H-NS.

Ambiguities in the reconstruction of sequences are resolved through the knowledge of the relative position of <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> specific recognition events. By varying the parameters (e.g., length of read, density of recognition events, resolution of the detector) governing a specific implementation of the method, it is possible to query all size scales of DNA variation, from single nucleotide sequence all the way to large structural variants and chromosomal aneuploidies.|$|E
5000|$|DNA {{crosslinks}} generally cause loss of <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> {{information from}} the two strands of DNA. Therefore, accurate repair of the damage depends on retrieving the lost information from an undamaged homologous chromosome in the same cell. Retrieval can occur by pairing with a sister chromosome produced during a preceding round of replication. In a diploid cell retrieval may also occur by pairing with a non-sister homologous chromosome, as occurs especially during meiosis. [...] Once pairing has occurred, the crosslink can be removed and correct information introduced into the damaged chromosome {{by the process of}} homologous recombinational repair.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} seventies and early eighties, Jo Messing and his colleagues {{developed}} the shotgun DNA sequencing method with single and paired synthetic universal primers. The method is based on fragmenting DNA into small sizes, purifying them by cloning, and defining the start of sequencing with a short oligonucleotide. Because fragmentation produces overlapping fragments, sequences can be concatenated by <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> information, thereby reconstructing contiguous sequences (contigs), which was first exemplified by the complete structure of a plant DNA virus. His cloning vectors were also used to develop the method for oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. DNA cloning, shotgun sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis became widely used to sequence large DNA molecules like human chromosomes and to engineer genes and proteins. These methods are freely available, have been {{the cornerstone of the}} biotechnology industry and are cited in many patents.|$|E

The clones for murinoglobulin contained <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequences</b> which together spanned a stretch of 4, 578 nucleotides with one open reading frame coding for 1, 464 amino acid residues. The phylogenetic analyses of 11 proteins of the a-macroglobulin family revealed that the mammalian tetrameric a-macroglobulins consist of two main branches: cM- 1 subfamily (rat a,- and mouse a-macroglobulins) and aM- 2 subfamily (human a 2 -, rat a 2 -, and guinea pig a-macroglobulins). This dichotomy is in good accordance with their immunological, chemi-cal, and physicochemical properties, and indicates that guinea pig a-macroglobulin is orthologous to human and rat a 2 -macroglobulins but paralogous to rat a,- and mouse a-macroglobulins.

40|$|CodY is {{a global}} {{transcriptional}} regulator that is activated by branched-chain amino acids. A palindromic 15 -bp sequence motif, AATTTTCNGAAAATT, is associated with CodY DNA binding. A gel mobility shift assay {{was used to examine}} the effect of pH on the binding of Bacillus subtilis CodY to the hutPp and ureAp 3 promoters. CodY at pH 6. 0 has higher affinity for DNA, more enhanced activation by isoleucine, and a lower propensity for nonspecific DNA binding than CodY at pH 8. 0. DNase I footprinting was used to identify the CodY-protected regions in the hutPp and ureAp 3 promoters. The CodY-protected sequences for both promoters were found to contain multiple copies of the 15 -bp motif with 6 -bp overlaps. Mutational analysis of the hutPp regulatory region revealed that two <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> motifs were required for CodY-mediated regulation. The presence of <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> motifs in the regulatory regions of many B. subtilis CodY-regulated genes suggests that CodY binds to native operators that contain overlapping binding sites.

40|$|Abstract only availableAdeno-associated virus (AAV) is {{a rising}} {{champion}} for gene therapy {{due to its}} powerful and safe gene delivery properties. Yet the small packaging capacity of AAV limits its application for large therapeutic genes. The hybrid dual vectors show promise in overcoming this limitation (Ghosh 2008). In this approach, the gene of interest is split into 5 ' and 3 ' parts. Each part is packaged in a separate AAV virion. The 5 ' vector carries a splice donor, and the 3 ' vector a splice acceptor. Both also share an <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence.</b> Recombination occurs simultaneously under two pathways, either through homologous recombination mediated by the <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> or head-to-tail ITR-mediated recombination. The recombined genome is spliced to generate mature mRNA. In an effort to further improve the hybrid vectors, we replaced the alkaline phosphatase (AP) <b>overlapping</b> <b>sequence</b> in a previously published LacZ hybrid vector set with an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequence. The ESE sequences are known to increase splicing efficiency (Skordis, 2003). We hypothesized that the ESE sequence should increase splicing efficiency in the hybrid vectors, hence, lead to greater gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we transfected 293 cells {{with a series of}} different LacZ constructs. We then measured LacZ protein expression by cytochemical staining and enzymatic assay. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) containing plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The ESE-intron LacZ, unmodified intact LacZ, intron LacZ and AP-intron LacZ yielded β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity of 475 ± 36, 361 ± 18, 283 ± 9 and 225 ± 35 units/µg protein, respectively. Next, we split the ESE-intron LacZ gene into two separate constructs, which {{can be used to make}} recombinant AAV. Encouragingly, co-transfection of the split LacZ ESE-intron constructs resulted in 5. 61 ± 0. 76 units/µg protein β-galactosidase activity while the previously described split LacZ AP-intron and split LacZ intron constructs resulted in 3. 93 ± 0. 36 and 3. 41 ± 0. 36 units/µg protein β-galactosidase activity, respectively. Our results suggest that the ESE-intron vector is operating at par with the intact gene and may provide better gene delivery than the current generation of hybrid vectors. Future study with the corresponding recombinant AAV viruses may further reveal the utility of ESE containing hybrid vectors. Summer Research Internship in Cell & Molecular Biolog...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The goal of {{our current}} {{consortium}} project is to launch a new era—functional genomics of poultry— by providing genomic resources [expressed sequence tags (EST) and DNA microarrays] and by examining global gene expression in target tissues of chickens.

In the SMG, CREB is inactivated by an inhibitory protein, permitting NREB to bind to the sequence, thus inhibiting Ren- 1 d expression. We hypothesize that the competition between NREB and CREB for this sequence governs tissue-specific expression of mouse renin.

Anti-Sox- 5 antibody was used to analyse expression of Sox- 5 in pre-pubertal testis and in fractionated spermatogenic cells. Sox- 5 is restricted to post-meiotic germ cells, being found at highest levels in round spermatids.
