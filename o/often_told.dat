5|$|Even though Richard's {{statistics}} {{showed he}} bounced between Houston and the minors {{during his first}} four years with the Astros due to his wildness, he <b>often</b> <b>told</b> reporters that racism {{played a role in}} keeping him from becoming a regular with the big club sooner.|$|E
5|$|In 18th-century Sicily, {{the peasants}} {{of the village}} of Nicolosi {{believed}} that Anne Boleyn, for having made Henry VIII a heretic, was condemned to burn for eternity inside Mount Etna. This legend was <b>often</b> <b>told</b> {{for the benefit of}} foreign travellers.|$|E

5|$|An avid {{baseball}} fan, Maxwell {{was among}} {{the founders of the}} Winnipeg Arena baseball club in 1908, and became the team's manager in 1912. At its peak, the team drew as many as 5,000 fans per game. As a player, manager or general manager, Maxwell was a member of eight Arena teams that won the Winnipeg city championship between 1908 and 1923. He was known for his quick, and often barbed, wit; His friends <b>often</b> <b>told</b> a story of an Arenas baseball game where, after failing to convince the umpire that it was too dark to play, Maxwell sent his players onto the field with lighted candles. In his later years, he served on the advisory board of the Winnipeg Goldeyes professional club.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920 {{election}} campaign, Taft {{supported the}} Republican ticket, Harding (by then a senator) and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge; they were elected. Taft {{was among those}} asked {{to come to the}} president-elect's home in Marion, Ohio to advise him on appointments, and the two men conferred there on December 24, 1920. By Taft's later account, after some conversation, Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court, for if Taft would, Harding would put him there. Taft had a condition for Harding: that having been president, and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis, he could only accept the chief justiceship. Harding made no response, and Taft in a thank-you note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had <b>often</b> <b>told</b> him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House. In January 1921, Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him, if given the chance.|$|E

25|$|Though Abel died in 1884, {{his life}} and in {{particular}} his ordination to the priesthood were a topic of conversation and debate long after his death. When questions concerning Blacks receiving the priesthood or temple blessings arose, the story of Elijah Abel was <b>often</b> <b>told.</b>|$|E
25|$|A noble lie, {{which also}} could be called a {{strategic}} untruth, is one that would normally cause discord if uncovered, but offers some benefit to the liar and assists in an orderly society, therefore, potentially beneficial to others. It is <b>often</b> <b>told</b> to maintain law, order and safety.|$|E
25|$|In late 1919, {{he married}} twenty-year-old Ruth Johnson, {{and the two}} moved in with Ruth's parents. Ruth became pregnant; reportedly, Wanderer became despondent upon hearing the news and became distant towards his family. Wanderer <b>often</b> <b>told</b> friends and family that he missed the Army and wished to reenlist, {{implying}} that Ruth opposed the idea.|$|E

50|$|Qisse are {{attributed}} to have inspired folk music in Punjabi and have added depth and richness to its delivery. These traditions were passed down generations in oral or written forms and were <b>often</b> recited, <b>told</b> as bedtime stories to children or performed musically as folk songs.|$|R
25|$|Time- The {{novel is}} not chronological, {{but rather a}} series of anecdotes told by Anna. For example, stories of Alyona as a child, teenager, and mother are intermixed and <b>often</b> <b>told</b> without time markers. This makes it {{difficult}} for the reader to follow the action of the story or the plot, and adds to the growing sense of disorder as the novel progresses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{story has}} it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task: add a list of {{integers}} in arithmetic progression; as the story is most <b>often</b> <b>told,</b> these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant Martin Bartels.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{wanted to}} change to {{recorded}} production for several reasons. The legend that has been most <b>often</b> <b>told</b> {{is that it would}} give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the Jasper National Park Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason.|$|E
60|$|You have <b>often</b> been <b>told</b> by your {{teachers}} to expect this last result: but I {{fear that the}} tendency of modern thought is to reject the idea of that essential difference in rank between one intellect and another, of which increasing reverence is the wise acknowledgment.|$|R
5000|$|Stanley Bruce, Australia's High Commissioner to London, was {{delegated}} by {{his government}} {{to sit in}} on meetings of Churchill's War Cabinet.

50|$|Birds in this genus {{have mostly}} drab {{coloration}} and display secretive behavior, keeping ensconced in vegetation {{most of the}} time. Species {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from one another {{on the basis of their}} similar plumage; however, they can <b>often</b> be <b>told</b> apart by their vocalizations, which can be quite distinctive.|$|R
25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve {{as a means to}} exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are <b>often</b> <b>told</b> the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are <b>often</b> <b>told</b> {{the story of a young}} man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.|$|E
25|$|An anecdote <b>often</b> <b>told</b> of Zwicky {{concerns}} {{an informal}} experiment {{to see if}} he could reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session one night at Mount Wilson observatory. He told his assistant to fire a gun out through the telescope slit, in the hope it would help to smooth out the turbulence. No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.|$|E
25|$|Another story, <b>often</b> <b>told</b> to tourists, {{tells of}} a wealthy {{merchant}} who, {{during a visit to}} the city with his family, had his beloved young son go missing. The merchant hastily formed a search party, which scoured all corners of the city, until the boy was found happily urinating in a small garden. The merchant, as a gift of gratitude to the locals who helped out during the search, had the fountain built.|$|E

5000|$|Film historians Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward {{praise the}} unusual melodrama in the RKO visual style. [...] "It is {{distinctive}} in its flashbacks within flashbacks, {{with the story}} <b>often</b> being <b>told</b> by a third or fourth person removed. This device is handled effectively {{in preparation for the}} climactic flashback, which reveals the truth." ...|$|R
25|$|Jim Walcott (Peter Keleghan) is City Hour {{similarly}} shallow but {{far less}} intelligent anchorman. Walcott is <b>often</b> <b>told</b> by {{the others that}} he is smart, but Findlay always refers to him as an idiot {{when he is not}} around. He lives alone with his cat and has been charged with sexual harassment several times, including an incident when he offered sexual favours to an underage girl in return for a ride in a helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Many {{children}} in care were untruthfully told {{that their parents}} were dead or had abandoned them. It was common policy to prevent parents from visiting. Parents were <b>often</b> <b>told</b> their children had been moved to other institutions or had been adopted, or that visiting rights had been withdrawn as punishment for misbehaviour. In later life, some people discovered letters on government and institution files showing that their parents had tried to make contact, or have them returned home.|$|E
25|$|While a {{habitual}} criminal, Makley cultivated {{the appearance}} and demeanor of a prosperous legitimate businessman. In between crimes {{he worked as}} a salesman and insurance agent, and could easily pass for a respectable citizen. A story <b>often</b> <b>told</b> of Makley is that some time in the mid-1920s after robbing a bank he went straight to a civic luncheon at which he was giving the keynote speech. The story itself is most likely apocryphal, but its popularity gives an insight into the man's charisma.|$|E

'The Abbess herself could not yield her; and, {{as you have}} so <b>often</b> been <b>told,</b> my young Lord, your absence is a far greater protection to your sister than your presence. Moreover, were the Tutor's mind at rest, there would be far better hope of his recovery.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a {{question}} about some money which he had paid to her, and which, under existing circumstances, he thought it as well {{that he should not}} pay.
