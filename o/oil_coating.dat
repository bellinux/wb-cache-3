40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the physiological status, blood profiles and body composition of sheep fed with Ca-saponified lemuru <b>oil</b> <b>coated</b> by herbs. Twenty fat-tailed sheep (av. BW 23 Â± 1. 2 kg) were used in this experiment by using Completely Randomized Design with five treatments ration and four replications of each. Sheep fed with concentrate containing 3 % Ca-saponified lemuru oil and king grass (1 : 1) ad libitum. Treatments were control diet without herbs (R 1); Ca-saponified lemuru <b>oil</b> <b>coated</b> by curcumae domestica (R 2); coated by Zingiber officinale Rosc (R 3); coated by Eugenia polyantha (R 4) and coated by Pluchea indica Less (R 5). Data of physiological parameters were measured three times a day, in the morning, at noon and afternoon. Blood samples were collected {{at the end of}} the experiment through jugular vein, together with zero sample for Urea Space measurement. The variables observed were physiological data (heart rate, respiration rate, and rectal temperature), blood profiles (erythrocyte, hemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), leucocytes) and body composition (water, protein and fat) measured using Urea Space technique. Results of the study showed that sheep fed with Ca-saponified lemuru <b>oil</b> <b>coated</b> by herbs was not significantly different on heart rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature among treatments. Meanwhile, total leucocytes, neutrophil cell, and lymphocytes significantly increased (P< 0. 05) by the treatment. Body composition percentage (water, protein and fat) were same in all treatments, except the total body fat and energy retained. In conclusion, supplementation of 3 % Ca-saponified lemuru <b>oil</b> <b>coated</b> by Curcumae domestica, Zingiber officinale Rosc, Eugenia polyantha and Pluchea indica Less in fat-tailed sheep had no effect on physiological parameters, but improved the leucocyte and neutrophil cells.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years many {{research}} groups have studied slippery properties on lubricating fluid infused rough surfaces using hydrophobic substrates. These surfaces show excellent slippery behaviour {{for water and}} other liquids. Here we demonstrate a simple method to fabricate stable slippery surfaces based on silicone <b>oil</b> <b>coated</b> hydrophilic samples. At room temperature, as prepared samples exhibit non-slippery behaviour due to sinking of water drops inside silicone oil layer because of inherently hydrophilic silicon substrate. Subsequent annealing at higher temperatures provides covalent bonding of silicone molecules at silicon surface making the surface hydrophobic which was confirmed by lubricant wash tests. So the silicone <b>oil</b> <b>coated</b> annealed samples show excellent water repellency, very low contact angle hysteresis and very good slippery behavior. But these surfaces show poor oil stability against drops flow due to cloaking of the oil around water drops which can be prevented by using drops of larger volume or continuous flow of water.

5000|$|Another area of {{difference}} between EPS-treated steel strip and acid-pickled steel strip is rust resistance. Conventional acid-pickled steel strip is frequently coated with a thin film of oil {{to serve as a}} barrier to contact with oxygen so as to prevent rusting. EPS-processed steel is inherently rust-inhibitive and, therefore, needs no oil or other coating to prevent rusting. Many [...] "downstream" [...] processes and steel fabrication processes must have the steel's <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> (or other surface contaminants) removed as a precursor step of the process. Use of EPS-treated steel in these processes precludes the need for any such [...] "oil-stripping" [...] precursor step, thereby simplifying the process.|$|E
5000|$|Smooth clean surface (SCS) and eco {{pickled surface}} (EPS) are more recent alternatives. In the SCS process, surface {{oxidation}} is removed using an engineered abrasive {{and the process}} leaves the surface resistant to subsequent oxidation {{without the need for}} oil film or other protective coating. EPS is a more direct replacement for acid pickling. Acid pickling relies on chemical reactions while EPS uses mechanical means. The EPS process is considered [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] compared with acid pickling and it imparts to carbon steel a high degree of rust resistance, eliminating the need to apply the <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> that serves as a barrier to oxidation for acid-pickled carbon steel.|$|E
50|$|Snap action {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid.

Grant also questions the lack of fingerprint evidence connecting Cobain to key evidence, including the shotgun (although this could be attributed to the gun's <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> or condensation in the greenhouse). Grant notes that the official report claims that Cobain's fingerprints were also absent from the suicide note as well as the pen (although, as it was stabbed into the soil, it would be likely that the moist soil would erase his fingerprints) that had been shoved through it, and yet Cobain was found without gloves on.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is notorious for its biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices {{and is one of the}} most frequent pathogenic agents in chronic osteomyelitis. Cinnamon oil has been proven to be an effective antimicrobial agent against several bacteria, including S. epidermidis. The eradication of S. epidermidis and prevention of biofilm formation on medical devices are desirable outcomes. Objective: To study the antimicrobial effect of cinnamon <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> on K-wire against S. epidermidis and to quantify the most effective concentration of cinnamon <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> on the K-wire. Method: The cinnamon oil was divided in ten different concentrations, from 0. 002 % to 1 %, and subsequently applied to the Kirschner wire (K-wire). Its antimicrobial effect was determined by agar well diffusion method (MHA). Cinnamon oil coated K-wires were planted on S. epidermidis inoculated Muller-Hinton Agar (MHA) plate. The size of the zone of inhibition was recorded to the nearest mm, and this was compared to gentamycin, fosfomycin, vancomycin, netilmycin. Result: The cream based 1 % concentration cinnamon <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> on K-wire showed the strongest antimicrobial effect on S. epidermidis inoculated MHA plate. This was evident especially in the fourth repetition, with an inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of 19 mm. In the 1 % concentration repetitions, the highest mean IZD of the 4 repetitions was 14 mm (intermediate according NCCLS). The mean IZD results demonstrate that cinnamon oil has 46. 3 % of the effectiveness of gentamycin, 49. 1 % of fosfomycin, 59. 6 % of vancomycin, and 43. 4 % of netilmycin. Conclusion: In this in-vitro study, cream based cinnamon <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> on K-wire is effective against S. epidermidis, though less effective compared to gentamycin, fosfomycin, vancomycin and netilmyci...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely&# 13; {{consumed}} fresh vegetables in the world; however, its highly perishable nature limits its postharvest&# 13; life. Major losses in tomato quality and quantity occur between harvest and consumption. Therefore,&# 13; the application of new technologies to extend the postharvest life of this commodity is needed. The use&# 13; of edible coatings appears to be a good alternative. Approach: We evaluated the effect of carnauba&# 13; and mineral oil coatings on the postharvest quality of tomato fruits (cv. Grandela). Stafresh 2505 &# 13; (carnauba) and Stafresh 151 (mineral oil) coatings were applied on fresh tomatoes at two maturity&# 13; stages (breaker and pink). The quality of tomatoes was evaluated periodically at 0, 5, 10, 15, 21 and 28 &# 13; days of storage at 10 Â°C, plus 2 days at 20 Â°C. For respiration rate analysis, tomatoes were kept at 20 Â°C&# 13; for 16 days. Results: At the beginning of the study, CO 2 production was reduced by 38 and 46 % when&# 13; applying the mineral <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> on breaker and pink tomatoes, respectively. In addition, early during&# 13; the study, the mineral <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> showed suppression of ethylene biosynthesis at both maturity stages. &# 13; Both coatings reduced 30 % PG activity of tomato tissue. At the end of storage, mineral oil coatings&# 13; delayed color changes and reduced weight losses for up 70 and 46 % at the breaker and pink stages,&# 13; respectively. Conclusion/Recommendations: Respiration rate, color, weight loss and enzyme activity&# 13; were positively affected by mineral <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> at both maturity stages. No effects on firmness,&# 13; titratable acidity and pH were found by the coating application.

30|$|In water-lubricated {{pipeline}} transportation of heavy oil and bitumen, a thin oil film typically coats the pipe wall. A {{detailed study of}} the hydrodynamic effects of this fouling layer {{is critical to the}} design and operation of oilâwater pipelines, as it can increase the pipeline pressure loss (and pumping power requirements) by 15 times or more. In this study, a parametric investigation of the hydrodynamic effects caused by the wall coating of viscous oil was conducted. A custom-built rectangular flow cell was used. A validated CFD-based procedure was used to determine the hydrodynamic roughness from the measured pressure losses. A similar procedure was followed for a set of pipe loop tests. The effects of the thickness of the <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> layer, the oil viscosity, and water flow rate on the hydrodynamic roughness were evaluated. Oil viscosities from 3 to 21300 Â PaÂ s were tested. The results show that the equivalent hydrodynamic roughness produced by a wall coating layer of viscous oil is dependent on the coating thickness but essentially independent of oil viscosity. A new correlation was developed using these data to predict the hydrodynamic roughness for flow conditions in which a viscous <b>oil</b> <b>coating</b> is produced on the pipe wall.|$|E
