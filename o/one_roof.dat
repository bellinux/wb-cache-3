5|$|In November 2007, the {{university}} was given planning permission to build the Surrey Multifaith Centre. This {{will be the first}} building in Britain to have a Synagogue, Muslim Prayer Hall, Gurdwara and Chapel built separately under <b>one</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|The King Life Sciences Building, {{which sits}} next to the College of Medicine, was {{completed}} in June 2008, bringing all the biological sciences departments under <b>one</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|The city is also {{popular with}} shoppers, having {{received}} Denmark's Best Shopping City Award in 2012. In {{addition to a}} wide variety of shops and restaurants along its two downtown pedestrian streets, Algade and Skomagergade, Roskilde's shopping centre RO's Torv on Københavnsvej to the east of the city houses 70 stores under <b>one</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{agricultural}} based community {{became a}} thriving {{community in the}} 1890s and still retains many of the buildings and structures which were present then. This {{is reflected in the}} fact that Vankleek Hill is the Gingerbread (the wood carvings on the eaves of <b>one's</b> <b>roof)</b> capital of Ontario.|$|R
5|$|According to Jerusalem {{architectural}} historian David Kroyanker, {{the heyday}} of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants who sought to recreate a European ambience in the city center. Their upscale boutiques, coffeehouses, delicatessens, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English-speaking tourists. Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under <b>one</b> <b>roof,</b> the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Chinese population in Sibu are Christians while other Chinese practice Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. Some of the Iban in Sibu are Christians. Malays and Melanaus are Muslims. Respective religious groups are free to hold their processions in the town. Several notable religious buildings in the town are Sacred Heart Cathedral, Masland Methodist Church, Tua Pek Kong Temple, and An-Nur Mosque. Yu Lun San Tien En Si (玉龙山天恩寺) or Jade Dragon Temple is located at KM26 Sibu-Bintulu Road. The temple combined Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism under <b>one</b> <b>roof.</b> It is {{claimed to be the}} largest temple in South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the Maceos, with Quinn, {{opened the}} Hollywood Dinner Club, {{at the time}} the most elegant night club on the Gulf Coast. The club {{featured}} crystal chandeliers, a massive dance floor, and air conditioning (a new technology at the time; the Hollywood was the first club in the nation to use it). Because of Sam's smooth personality he became the face of the nightclub. Guy Lombardo performed for the club's opening, and Sam attracted a steady stream of celebrity performers thereafter. The club hosted one of the nation's first remote radio broadcasts, and featured Ben Bernie's orchestra (one of the nation's most famous performing groups), which was introduced by a young Walter Cronkite. The club, the first venue in the nation to offer high-class gaming, dining, and entertainment, and air-conditioning under <b>one</b> <b>roof,</b> was unique at the time.|$|E
60|$|The {{bridge was}} one of those old-fashioned, wooden <b>ones,</b> <b>roofed</b> in and sided up, and it {{stretched}} from shore to shore, like a tunnel, on its piers. It was rather dim, even {{in the middle of the}} brightest day, and none of the boys liked to be caught in it after sunset.|$|R

5|$|Tamu Bintulu and Pasar Utama are the {{two main}} markets in the town. Both places have a unique {{cone-shaped}} roof that symbolises the traditional Melanau headgear named Terendak. Tamu Bintulu offers items ranging from jungle produce to native home-made specialties such as Belacan. Meanwhile, Pasar Utama houses both wet market and dry market under <b>one</b> <b>roof,</b> providing fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, and dairy products. The first floor of Pasar Utama {{offers a variety of}} fast food such as Laksa, Kolok Mee, Jawa Mee, Pulut Panggang, ais batu campur, cendol, and teh tarik. The Bintulu night market is located on Kampung Dagang road. There are over 150 stalls selling a variety of items such as garments, electric goods, vegetables, fruits, food and drinks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under <b>one</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under <b>one</b> <b>roof.</b> In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{buildings}} have carved ball finials on the gable ends as per the architectural fashion of the time. The finial can also function as a lightning rod, and was once believed {{to act as a}} deterrent to witches on broomsticks attempting to land on <b>one's</b> <b>roof.</b> On making her final landing approach to a roof, the witch, spotting the obstructing finial, was forced to sheer off and land elsewhere.|$|R

The designed family house is a two-storeyed <b>one</b> <b>roofed</b> over with a single pitched roof. As a part of the building there is a garage for one parking place and a terrace accessible from the second storey. The new building is designed for the 4 – 5 member family...|$|R

5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under <b>one</b> <b>roof</b> was commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{returned}} to Britain, from Quebec, {{with her husband}} on 27 October 1883, and landed at Liverpool. Queen Victoria had prepared apartments at Kensington Palace, and the couple took up official residence there. Louise retained those apartments until her death there 56 years later. Lorne resumed his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1896, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists. Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the Queen's attempts to keep them under <b>one</b> <b>roof,</b> they often went their separate ways. Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the Prince of Wales did not take to him. Out of all the royal family, Lorne {{was the only one}} to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons.|$|E

50|$|Simply {{adjusting}} the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens {{may be all}} that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off <b>one's</b> <b>roof</b> than people realize. Often the required location and storage capacity of the garden area must be determined first. Rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation, not the other way around.|$|R
50|$|The south towers that {{frame the}} house, named the Sault and Beauregard towers, {{are the highest}} at 15 m. These 6 m {{diameter}} towers were accessed through the court {{as well as through}} {{the first floor of the}} house. They were probably covered by a battlement-style terrace, and the domed roofs were later replaced with pepperpot-style <b>roofs.</b> <b>One</b> domed <b>roof</b> still remains in good condition.|$|R

25|$|One {{particular}} concept exploited was {{a decree}} {{ascribed to the}} mythical first emperor of Japan, Emperor Jimmu, in 660 BCE: the policy of hakkō ichiu (八紘一宇, all eight {{corners of the world}} under <b>one</b> <b>roof).</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{attributes}} are {{fundamental to the}} Kodoshugisha (Imperial Way) and give Japan a divine mission to bring all nations under <b>one</b> <b>roof,</b> so that all humanity can share {{the advantage of being}} ruled by the Tenno.|$|E
50|$|The {{main source}} of heat {{transfer}} is radiant energy, and the primary source is the sun. Solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows (but also through walls). Thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler <b>one.</b> <b>Roofs</b> receive {{the majority of the}} solar radiation delivered to a house. A cool roof, or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature (see albedo, absorptivity, emissivity, and reflectivity).|$|R

It is a red brick immensity with gray sandstone lintels and a roof of slate in courses of red, green, and dyspeptic yellow. There are two anemic towers, <b>one</b> <b>roofed</b> with copper, the other crowned with castiron ferns. The porch is like an open tomb; it is supported by squat granite pillars above which hang frozen cascades of brick. At one side of the house is a huge stained-glass window {{in the shape of a}} keyhole.|$|R

25|$|A finial from Chapelton House or {{possibly}} a 'wheat sheaf' {{from the old}} Monks' Well {{is used as a}} feature in the gardens.

An old lintel from a door is recorded in 1939 as being built into a wall in the garden with the inscription 'S.M. 1740', possibly standing for one of the 'Miller' family'.|$|R
