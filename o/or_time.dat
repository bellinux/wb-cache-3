5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano <b>or</b> <b>time</b> elapsed from eruption.

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, <b>or</b> <b>time</b> it takes for the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|A partial ouster <b>or</b> <b>time</b> limit clause {{specifies}} {{a restricted}} period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith.

In the absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family.

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} is often high among ruffed lemurs, {{but can also}} be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, possibly due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant {{mortality is}} as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, <b>or</b> <b>time</b> between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active {{until the age of}} 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Linguist Derek Bickerton, {{building}} {{on the work of}} biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space <b>or</b> <b>time</b> from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans.|$|E

5|$|Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding <b>or</b> <b>time</b> for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious <b>or</b> <b>time</b> runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was noted}} {{to appeal to}} many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, <b>or</b> <b>time</b> trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were {{inviting}} for breakaways. Sastre, {{one of the first}} riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time trialing was not great and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time trialing to be Giro champion.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a total ouster or {{finality}} clause {{which seeks}} to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial ouster <b>or</b> <b>time</b> limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available.

5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock <b>or</b> <b>time.</b> A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Hamence played 19first-class {{matches and}} scored 582runs {{at an average}} of 32.33. An {{occasional}} bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of medium pace during the tour, he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches. He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball, occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first-choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests. Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week. In most of the matches, Hamence batted in the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7.N- Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30. and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, he seldom batted in the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target <b>or</b> <b>time</b> ran out.|$|E

5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, <b>or</b> <b>time</b> limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|In many languages, {{including}} modern European {{languages and}} Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, {{the use of}} structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part {{under the influence of}} the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures <b>or</b> <b>time</b> periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.|$|E
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out <b>or</b> <b>time</b> as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E
