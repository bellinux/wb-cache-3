No shadow fell upon the agreeable excitement of his mind until he faced the anxious and reproachful face of Johnson, who had been sitting up for him, smoking and trying to read the <b>odd</b> <b>volume</b> of [...] "Purchas his Pilgrimes,"--about the monk who went into Sarmatia and saw the Tartar carts.|$|E
60|$|June 1.--We took {{leave of}} our friends at Rokeby after breakfast, and pursued our {{well-known}} path over Stanmore to Brough, Appleby, Penrith, and Carlisle. As I have this road by heart, I have little amusement save the melancholy task of recalling the sensations with which I have traced it in former times, all of which refer to decay of animal strength, and abatement if not of mental powers, at least of mental energy. The non est tanti grows fast at my time of life. We reached Carlisle at seven o'clock, and were housed for the night. My books being exhausted, I lighted on an <b>odd</b> <b>volume</b> of the Gentleman's Magazine, a work in which, as in a pawnbroker's shop, much of real curiosity and value are stowed away and concealed amid the frippery and trumpery of those reverend old gentlewomen who were the regular correspondents of the work.|$|E

6000|$|For some {{minutes he}} was too {{thoroughly}} absorbed by the images {{to reflect on the}} fact that he saw them, and note the fact as a change. But when that sudden clearness had travelled through the distance, and came at last to rest on the scene just gone by, he felt fully where he was: he remembered Monna Lisa and Tessa. Ah! he then was the mysterious husband; he who had another wife in the Via de' Bardi. It was time to pick up the broken dagger and go--go and leave no trace of himself; for to hide his feebleness seemed the thing most like power that was left to him. He leaned to take up the fragments of the dagger; then he turned towards the book which lay open at his side. It was a fine large manuscript, an <b>odd</b> <b>volume</b> of Pausanias.

6000|$|The sun was down, the sky all on fire, and {{the lamp}} {{had been some}} time lighted, when Case came back with Uma and the negro.

She showed the best bearing for a bride conceivable, serious and still; and I thought shame to stand up with her in that mean house and before that grinning negro. I thought shame, I say; for the mountebank was dressed with a big paper collar, the book he made believe to read from was an <b>odd</b> <b>volume</b> of a novel, and the words of his service not fit to be set down.

6000|$|In a moment, {{as if by}} magic, {{the shelves}} round the room were filled with Blinton's books, all tied up in big lots of some thirty volumes each. His early Molieres were {{fastened}} to old French dictionaries and school-books. His Shakespeare quartos {{were in the same}} lot with tattered railway novels. His copy (almost unique) of Richard Barnfield's much too 'Affectionate Shepheard' was coupled with odd volumes of 'Chips from a German Workshop' and a cheap, imperfect example of 'Tom Brown's School-Days.' Hookes's 'Amanda' was {{at the bottom of a}} lot of American devotional works, where it kept company with an Elzevir Tacitus and the Aldine 'Hypnerotomachia.' The auctioneer put up lot after lot, and Blinton plainly saw that the whole affair was a [...] "knock-out." [...] His most treasured spoils were parted with at the price of waste paper. It is an awful thing to be present at one's own sale. No man would bid above a few shillings. Well did Blinton know that after the knock-out the plunder would be shared among the grinning bidders. At last his 'Adonais,' uncut, bound by Lortic, went, in company with some old 'Bradshaws,' the 'Court Guide' of 1881, and an <b>odd</b> <b>volume</b> of the 'Sunday at Home,' for sixpence. The Stranger smiled a smile of peculiar malignity. Blinton leaped up to protest; the room seemed to shake around him, but words would not come to his lips.|$|E
60|$|Trying {{to settle}} down, therefore, in my solitude, I {{first of all}} asked what books there were in the house. The waiter brought me a Book of Roads, two or three old Newspapers, a little Song-Book, {{terminating}} {{in a collection of}} Toasts and Sentiments, a little Jest-Book, an <b>odd</b> <b>volume</b> of Peregrine Pickle, and the Sentimental Journey. I knew every word of the two last already, but I read them through again, then tried to hum all the songs (Auld Lang Syne was among them); went entirely through the jokes,--in which I found a fund of melancholy adapted to my state of mind; proposed all the toasts, enunciated all the sentiments, and mastered the papers. The latter had nothing in them but stock advertisements, a meeting about a county rate, and a highway robbery. As I am a greedy reader, I could not make this supply hold out until night; it was exhausted by tea-time. Being then entirely cast upon my own resources, I got through an hour in considering what to do next. Ultimately, it came into my head (from which I was anxious by any means to exclude Angela and Edwin), that I would endeavour to recall my experience of Inns, and would try how long it lasted me. I stirred the fire, moved my chair a little {{to one side of the}} screen,--not daring to go far, for I knew the wind was waiting to make a rush at me, I could hear it growling,--and began.|$|E
