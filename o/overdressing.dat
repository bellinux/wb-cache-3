6000|$|By {{the time}} all was quiet again I heard the Altrurian saying: [...] "As to our social life, I cannot {{describe}} it in detail, but I {{can give you}} some notion of its spirit. We make our pleasures civic and public as far as possible, and the ideal is inclusive and not exclusive. There are, of course, festivities which all cannot share, but our distribution into small communities favors the possibility of all doing so. Our daily life, however, is so largely social that we seldom meet by special invitation or engagement. When we do, {{it is with the}} perfect understanding that the assemblage confers no social distinction, but is for a momentary convenience. In fact, these occasions are rather avoided, recalling, as they do, the vapid and tedious entertainments of the competitive epoch, the receptions and balls and dinners of a semi-barbaric people striving for social prominence by shutting a certain number in and a certain number out, and <b>overdressing,</b> overfeeding, and overdrinking. Anything premeditated {{in the way of a}} pleasure we think stupid and mistaken; we like to meet suddenly, or on the spur of the moment, out-of-doors, if possible, and arrange a picnic or a dance or a play; and let people come and go without ceremony. No one is more host than guest; all are hosts and guests. People consort much according to their tastes--literary, musical, artistic, scientific, or mechanical--but these tastes are made approaches, not barriers; and we find out that we have many more tastes in common than was formerly supposed.|$|E
6000|$|The spectator of {{whom they}} would thus {{well have been}} worthy might have read {{meanings}} of his own into the intensity of their communion--or indeed, even without meanings, have found his account, aesthetically, in some gratified play of our modern sense of type, so scantly to be distinguished from our modern sense of beauty. Type was there, at the worst, in Mrs. Assingham's dark, neat head, on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she desired. Full of discriminations against the obvious, she had yet to accept a flagrant appearance {{and to make the}} best of misleading signs. Her richness of hue, her generous nose, her eyebrows marked like those of an actress-- these things, with an added amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal, seemed to present her insistently as a daughter of the south, or still more of the east, a creature formed by hammocks and divans, fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves. She looked as if her most active effort might be to take up, as she lay back, her mandolin, or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle. She was in fact, however, neither a pampered Jewess nor a lazy Creole; New York had been, recordedly, her birthplace and [...] "Europe" [...] punctually her discipline. She wore yellow and purple because she thought it better, as she said, while one was about it, to look like the Queen of Sheba than like a revendeuse; she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold in her tea-gown for the same reason: it was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown, as it was hopeless to try to chasten, the <b>overdressing.</b> So she was covered and surrounded with [...] "things," [...] which were frankly toys and shams, a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her friends. These friends were in the game that of playing with the disparity between her aspect and her character. Her character was attested by the second movement of her face, which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours of the world was not supine, not passive. She enjoyed, she needed the warm air of friendship, but the eyes of the American city looked out, somehow, for the opportunity of it, from under the lids of Jerusalem. With her false indolence, in short, her false leisure, her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains, she was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail, detail that left her, as it at any moment found her, unappalled and unwearied.|$|E

50|$|Fulsome {{praise of}} Mrs. Waylett in the Theatrical Looker-On, a Birmingham paper {{associated}} {{in the mind}} of the Birmingham public with Alfred Bunn, gave rise to a crop of scandals. There were legal threats on Bunn's part, of prosecutions for libel. Bunn demanded an apology for what was said concerning the two as a couple in William Oxberry's Dramatic Biography in 1827. Oxberry refused to apologise, and there was talk of a duel. Mrs. Waylett was taxed with ostentatiously <b>overdressing</b> the chambermaid parts in which she was seen.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s it was {{no longer}} the done thing to follow fashion slavishly, a sharp {{contrast}} to the highly a la mode 1970s and 1980s. The phobia of being underdressed was finally completely displaced by the fear of <b>overdressing.</b> Fashion in the 1990s united around a new standard, minimalism, and styles of stark simplicity became the vogue. Despite the best efforts of a few designers to keep the flag for pretty dresses flying, {{by the end of the}} decade the notion of ostentatious finery had virtually disappeared. As well as the styling of the product, its promotion in the media became crucial to its success and image. The financial pressures of the decade had a devastating effect on the development of new talent and lessened the autonomy enjoyed by more established designers.|$|E

40|$|Tie <b>overdressing</b> is {{commonly}} used to secure the graft against the raw surface and prevent loss due to of hematoma or seroma. A conventional tie over dressing with silk sutures, is a useful method of securing the graft to raw area. Refixation is difficult when repeated tie over dressings are needed. We assessed a low cost repeated tie over dressing method using sterile sample collection containers and silk suture threads in eight patients. After the graft is applied on the bed, tie-over stitches are taken, and paraffin gauze is applied over with adequate padding; the tie over sutures are passed through the container and the lid is tightened over it to complete the dressing. The lid can be unscrewed easily at any time to inspect the graft and can be easily reapplied in the outpatient department. The skin graft take in all the patients was complete without any seroma or hematoma. A novel and low-cost tie over dressing that enables simple fixation of the dressing, to maintain proper position of grafts that require repeated fixation is reported here...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} heat stress can be evaluated using a physiological strain index (PSI) that incorporates rectal temperature (T­re) {{and heart rate}} (HR) of a subject during exercise. Athletes interested in the performance benefits of heat acclimation often over-dress during exercise in temperate environments {{in an attempt to}} simulate heat stress, but it is unknown whether this creates a similar level of physiological strain as exercise in the heat. PURPOSE: To compare the PSI of athletes exercising in a HOT (40 C; 30 % RH) environment and with excess clothing in a COOL (15 C; 50 % RH) environment. METHODS: Eight endurance trained athletes were studied (5 M, 3 F; Aged 23 ± 7 years; VO 2 max 59. 8 ± 10. 2 ml/kg/min) during one hour of running at 50 % of their VO 2 max in HOT and COOL environments. In the HOT trial, the clothing was minimal (singlet and shorts). In the COOL trial, multiple insulative and vapor-impermeable layers were worn to impose similar themoregulatory strain as the HOT trial. Tre and HR were recorded at 5 minute intervals and used to calculate PSI = 5 (Tre t− Tre 0) ⋅ (39. 5 − Tre 0) − 1 + 5 (HRt − HR 0) ⋅ (180 − HR 0) − 1. Mean PSI was compared using paired sample t-tests, and PSI values were additionally compared between trials using an a priori zone of indifference of ± 1. RESULTS: PSI rose over time in both environments (HOT: 2. 95 to 8. 71; COOL: 2. 80 to 7. 25) Mean PSI was higher in HOT compared with COOL (6. 00 ± 0. 95 vs 5. 16 ± 1. 10; p=. 042). When comparing mean PSI between HOT and COOL, 5 of 8 subjects tested were within the zone of indifference. The 3 subjects that were outside of the zone had the highest initial HR of all the subjects tested. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that <b>overdressing</b> during a bout of exercise in a temperate environment results in significant increases in PSI, but that the ensemble used did not fully match the HOT condition. By adequately <b>overdressing,</b> athletes may be able to mimic heat stress and potentially obtain the benefits of heat acclimation in a cooler environment...|$|E
