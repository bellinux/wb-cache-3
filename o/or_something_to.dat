At that time: “marriage was more popular than ever before.” In 1953, a popular book of advice for women states: “A happy marriage may be seen, not as a holy state <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> which a few may luckily attain, but rather as the best course, the simplest, and the easiest way of life for us all”.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{things can}} be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the same}} way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event.

Scott's agent campaigned for her and guaranteed the series' producers that if she was not considered for the role, he would never send another actor to the casting director of the show. Scott won the role, but producer Chip Johannessen recalled that [...] "she wasn't what the network were looking, they wanted Heather Locklear <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come.

Conscience, according to Johnson, {{was nothing more than}} a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly known.

500|$|In July 2013, Jed Whedon {{said the}} series {{would work in}} tandem with the Marvel films, both past and upcoming, to weave in between the films, and to [...] "try to make them more {{rewarding}} on both ends." [...] He explained that each Marvel project is intended to stand alone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has to work with the film division and be aware of their plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the universe. Bell elaborated that this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa. He stated that [...] "ABC and Marvel both want the series {{to be able to make}} sense on its own", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any [...] "gaps" [...] for them, due to having to be [...] "big" [...] and moving [...] "quickly through a lot of huge pieces", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.|$|E

500|$|Originally, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} a white actress to play the part. Klea Scott's agent thought she was [...] "really right" [...] for the part. He then went down to {{the producers}} for the show and campaigned for her and guaranteed them if she did not fit for the role, he would never send another actor to the casting director of the show. Scott auditioned with four other actresses to get the part. Scott won the role, but producer Chip Johannessen recalled that [...] "she wasn't what the network were looking, they wanted Heather Locklear <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> come. That was kind of how that went down". Fox backed down, and Scott got the role. Scott had been living in Los Angeles, but relocated to the series' filming location in Vancouver when she joined the cast. Scott had little input in her character's development, and admitted feeling [...] "a little hurt" [...] to find that Hollis had joined the Millennium Group {{by the end of the}} series; however, Scott felt this development was [...] "believable and real". Scott's first day on set was during the filming of the final scene of [...] "The Innocents", the third season's opening episode. The actress found it difficult to adjust to the series' heavy workload, but found it enjoyable to work with co-star Lance Henriksen.|$|E
500|$|His last book, The Great Galilean, {{has been}} characterised by one biographer as Keable's attempt [...] "to renconcile {{his love of}} Jesus with his failure to believe in him as a God." [...] The book sought to {{distinguish}} the [...] "historical Jesus" [...] of record from the [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] of church worship. The historical Jesus, Keable said, was so poorly known that there survived too little information for a three-line obituary. Instead, the figure that Christians worshipped was a [...] "traditional Jesus", recorded in the Gospels from an oral tradition that was not really biographical. This [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] became a [...] "literary Jesus", the central figure of the four gospels, and it is on this figure – quite distinct from the actual, historical Jesus – that the contemporary church centred. Keable sought to criticise the attitude in the contemporary church toward [...] "traditional Jesus", given {{how much of the}} rest of [...] "traditional" [...] religion Protestantism had discarded. However, Keable was at pains to stress that the [...] "traditional" [...] Jesus should not be seen as an , <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be discarded. The ahistoricity of the traditional Jesus, he said, should not be a reason to leave the church. Without this traditional Jesus, he predicted, Western civilisation would fade and fall. He was, then, critical of the specific ways in which the contemporary church construed Jesus, in its attempts to conflate the traditional Jesus with historical Jesus, which Keable considered impossible. He blamed these actions of the church for the declining numbers of worshippers, and accused it of draining Christianity of profundity by relying too heavily on rationalism and rigid structure.|$|E

2500|$|This legend, which {{surfaced}} on the Internet just in {{time for}} Halloween in October 2004, claimed that drug dealers were giving lollipops laced with drugs, typically a combination of THC and PCP, to unsuspecting children and causing them great harm. [...] Such suckers are allegedly referred to as [...] "dro pops" [...] <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> that effect, and various towns around the country have had their own versions of the legend. [...] According to the U.S. DEA, suckers containing THC and/or PCP have been found and confiscated in Chicago in the spring of 2004. [...] They also report that in 2003 and 2004 some psilocybin mushroom chocolate candies were seized near Amarillo, Texas, and that hollowed-out lollipops filled with heroin have been seized in New York City. The goal of doing so was likely to evade detection by law enforcement by disguising the drugs as candy. There is no evidence that these were ever given to children, much less that any such children were harmed, or even that such lollipops have been found outside of these specific locations or anywhere since early 2004. Thus, this legend can be considered to be in a similar vein as the infamous blue star tattoo legend.|$|E
