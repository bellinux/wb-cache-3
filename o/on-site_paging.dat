50|$|Unlike mobile phones, most one-way pagers do not display any {{information}} about whether a signal is being received or about {{the strength of the}} received signal. Since one-way pagers do not contain transmitters, one-way paging networks have no way to track whether a message has been successfully delivered to a pager. Because of this, if a one-way pager is turned off or is not receiving a usable signal at the time a message is transmitted, the message will not be received and the sender of the message will not be notified of this fact. In the mid-1990s, some paging companies began offering a service, which allowed a customer to call their pager-number, and have numeric messages read back to them. This was useful for times when the pager was off or out of the coverage area, as it would know what pages were sent to you even if you never actually received the page. Other radio bands used for pagers include the 400 MHz band, the VHF band, and the FM commercial broadcast band (88-108 MHz). Other paging protocols used in the VHF, 400 MHz UHF, and 900 MHz bands include POCSAG and ERMES. Pagers using the commercial FM band receive a subcarrier, called the Subsidiary Communications Authority, of a broadcast station. <b>On-site</b> <b>paging</b> systems in hospitals, unlike wide area paging systems, are local area services. Hospitals commonly use <b>on-site</b> <b>paging</b> for communication with staff and increasingly for contacting waiting patients when their appointment is due. These offer waiting patients the opportunity to leave the waiting area, but still be contacted.|$|E
50|$|An {{emergency}} {{communication system}} may be composed of a product and its associated hardware and software, as owned by the entity using it (e.g., an <b>on-site</b> <b>paging</b> network), or as a service owned and provided by a third-party (e.g., a cellular carrierâ€™s SMS network). Each have their own advantages and disadvantages; however, despite perception otherwise, services have some major inherent problems {{when it comes to}} effective emergency communications. For instance, using SMS as one example, due to the architecture of cellular networks, text messaging services {{would not be able to}} handle a large volume of communications in a short period of time, making this particular type of service a potentially ineffective emergency communication method.|$|E
5000|$|Neckles {{left his}} job with Accenture {{after one year}} to become an {{entrepreneur}} {{at the age of}} 24. [...] He started his first company, TNTech Canada, a leading supplier and distributor of <b>on-site</b> <b>paging</b> services in Canada. In 2008, Neckles founded Neckles Global Enterprise Inc. (NGE), a privately held investment company which owns a collection of diversified businesses operating in sectors that include real estate, trade and manufacturing and includes TNTech Canada. TNTech has helped maximize the efficiency and communication for clients including Jack Astor's, The Keg Steakhouse, Baton Rouge (restaurant) and Shoppers Drug Mart. Neckles also founded Certified Ace Inc., a company that facilitates the hiring and completion of services across 90 categories through the use of small businesses in Canada,the United States and Australia.|$|E
50|$|In Italy the 26.225-26.935 MHz band (AM/FM, odd {{frequency}} steps) and 40.0125-40.0875 MHz (in 25 kHz steps) may be {{used for}} local pagers. These frequencies are often used for <b>on-site</b> hospital <b>paging</b> systems, including voice paging. Use of POCSAG on the 26 MHz and 27 MHz band has been logged by several listeners in Europe, specifically frequencies 26.350 MHz, 26.500 MHz, 26.705 MHz, 26.725 MHz, 26.755 MHz, 27.005 MHz, 27.007 MHz, 27.255 MHz (see note below regarding legal use of 27.255 MHz for paging in the United States). It appears that US-specification paging systems operating on 27.255 MHz have been sold in Italy and other European countries.|$|R
40|$|Background: Rapid {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} metabolic derangements {{is crucial in}} the critically ill. We evaluated if arterial blood gas (ABG) samples transported through a pneumatic tube system (PTS) agreed with values transported by a human courier. Methods: In this prospective study of 50 -paired ABG samples, the couriered reference ABG was compared with those transported by PTS. Agreement was summarised by the mean difference with 95 % limits of agreement (LOA) and Lin's concordance correlation (pc). Results: The mean (+/- SD) time from sampling to analysis was 35. 7 +/- 23. 2 (courier) and 38. 6 +/- 22. 1 (PTS) minutes. Agreement was good between courier and PTS for pH, PaCO(2), bicarbonate, oxygen saturation and PaO(2) values (pc > 0. 97). Although the mean difference in PaO(2) values between PTS and courier was small (- 0. 9 mm Hg) and the agreement was good, individual differences were clinically significant (95 % LOA - 40. 8 to 39. 0). For PaO(2) 160 mm Hg compared to manual courier. This suggested exaggerated oxygen movement between the blood sample and air in the PTS. Conclusions: In this study, analysis of samples transported through the PTS resulted in clinically unacceptable PaO(2) values. Delay in transport and analysis of ABG samples should be avoided and samples transported manually if they cannot be assessed <b>on-site.</b> 7 <b>page(s...</b>|$|R
