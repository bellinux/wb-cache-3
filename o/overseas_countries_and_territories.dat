25|$|The United Kingdom has two {{sovereign}} {{base areas}} on Cyprus, namely Akrotiri and Dhekelia. Unlike other British overseas territories, {{they are not}} listed as <b>Overseas</b> <b>Countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>Territories</b> under the Treaty of Rome and their inhabitants (who are entitled to British Overseas Territories Citizenship) have never been entitled to British citizenship.|$|E
25|$|Only the Netherlands' European {{territory}} {{is part of}} the Schengen Area. Six Dutch territories in the Caribbean are outside the Area. Three of these territories – Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba (collectively known as the BES islands) – are special municipalities within the Netherlands proper. The other three – Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten – are autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. All islands retain their status as <b>Overseas</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>territories</b> and are thus not part of the European Union. The six territories have a separate visa system from the European part of the Netherlands and people travelling between these islands and the Schengen Area are subjected to full border checks, with a passport being required even for EU/Schengen citizens, including Dutch (national ID cards are not accepted).|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "special case" [...] {{provided}} a fisheries {{agreement between the}} parties in which the European Community and later the European Union kept its fishing rights and Greenland kept its financial contribution as before the withdrawal. It also gave Greenland tariff free access of fisheries products to the EU {{as long as there}} exists a satisfactory fisheries agreement. Greenland is furthermore associated with the EU through its placement in the <b>Overseas</b> <b>Country</b> <b>and</b> <b>Territories</b> Association Decision.|$|R
50|$|Outside the EU, {{there are}} {{currently}} three French <b>territories</b> <b>and</b> a British <b>territory</b> that have agreements to use the euro as their currency. All other dependent territories of eurozone member states that have opted {{not to be a}} part of EU, usually with <b>Overseas</b> <b>Country</b> <b>and</b> <b>Territory</b> (OCT) status, use local currencies which are often pegged to the euro or US dollar. As non-sovereign entities, dependent territories which have adopted the euro are not permitted to mint euro coins like the European microstates, nor do they get a seat in the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Eurogroup. France is responsible for ensuring that the laws governing the EMU apply in their territories which use the euro.|$|R
50|$|Greenland {{joined the}} European Communities in 1973 when Denmark joined, {{even though a}} {{majority}} of 70% of the Greenlandic votes had been against membership in the Danish EC referendum held in 1972. In the spring of 1981, after the Greenlandic home-rule had been established in 1979 and the eurosceptic Siumut won the 1979 election, the Parliament of Greenland agreed to hold a consultative referendum on their continued membership. The result of the referendum was a majority in favour of leaving the EC, and this was enacted by the Greenland Treaty, which allowed the EC to keep its fishing rights. Greenland continues to be considered an <b>Overseas</b> <b>Countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>Territory</b> of the EU, giving it a special relationship with the Union.|$|R
25|$|Gibraltar is {{the only}} {{overseas}} territory {{that is part of}} the European Union (EU), although it is not part of the European Customs Union, the European Tax Policy, the European Statistics Zone or the Common Agriculture Policy. Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union in its own right. The Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus are not part of the European Union, but they are the only British overseas territory to use the euro as official currency. None of the other Overseas Territories are members of the EU, the main body of EU law does not apply and, although certain slices of EU law are applied to those territories as part of the EU's Association of <b>Overseas</b> <b>Countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>Territories</b> (OCT Association), they are not commonly enforceable in local courts. The OCT Association also provides overseas territories with structural funding for regeneration projects.|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{link to the}} UK, the Falklands {{are part}} of the <b>overseas</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>territories</b> of the European Union. The islands' {{judicial}} system, overseen by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is largely based on English law, and the constitution binds the territory to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights. Residents have the right of appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and the Privy Council. Law enforcement {{is the responsibility of the}} Royal Falkland Islands Police (RFIP), and military defence of the islands is provided by the United Kingdom. A British military garrison is stationed on the islands, and the Falkland Islands government funds an additional company-sized light infantry Falkland Islands Defence Force. The territorial waters of the Falklands extend to [...] from its coastal baselines, based on the [...] United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; this border overlaps with the maritime boundary of Argentina.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{outermost}} regions and the <b>overseas</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>territories</b> fall into structured categories to which common mechanisms apply, {{this is not}} true of all the special territories. Some territories have ad hoc arrangements in their relationship with the EU. Some of these could be called [...] "protocol territories" [...] as their status is governed by protocols attached to their respective countries' accession treaties. The rest owe their status to European Union legislative provisions which exclude the territories from the application of the legislation concerned. Many were opted out from either the VAT area or the customs union or both.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a special}} municipality, Bonaire {{is very much}} like {{ordinary}} Dutch municipalities in that it has a mayor, aldermen and a municipal council, and is governed according to most Dutch law. Antillean legislation remained in force after 10 October 2010, with the exception of those cases where Antillean law was replaced by Bonaire's municipal law. It was believed best for the island to not introduce the entire body of Dutch legislation at one time as it would cause confusion. Therefore, Dutch legislation is being introduced in stages. Bonaire retained its own unique culture while residents enjoy the same rights as Dutch citizens, including the right to vote in Dutch parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. Residents also have access to new or improved facilities and government benefits including, but not limited to, universal health care; improved health care facilities; better educational facilities with additional training for teachers, new teaching methods, and new school buildings; social housing for low-income individuals and families; a centrally dispatched single police force, fire department and ambulance service. [...] While the three islands are considered to be land of the Netherlands, they are {{not a part of the}} European Union, therefore not subject to European Union Law. They are considered to be an <b>overseas</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>territory</b> <b>and</b> will remain as such until at least 2015.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>overseas</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>territories</b> (OCT) are {{dependent}} territories {{that have a}} special relationship {{with one of the}} member states of the EU, and have been explicitly invited by the EU treaty to join the EU-OCT Association (OCTA). They were listed in [...] acc. to Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which aside from inviting them to join OCTA, also provided them the opportunity to opt into EU provisions on the freedom of movement for workers and freedom of establishment. Yet, the freedom of establishment is limited by Article 203 TFEU and the respective Council Decision on OCTs (...) [...] Its Article 51(1)(a) prescribes only that [...] "the Union shall accord to natural and legal persons of the OCTs a treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment applicable to like natural and legal persons of any third country with whom the Union concludes or has concluded an economic integration agreement." [...] Again this can be, according to Article 51(2)(b) limited. The obligations provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to treatment granted under measures providing for recognition of qualifications, licences or prudential measures in accordance with Article VII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) or the GATS Annex on Financial [...] Services.|$|E
