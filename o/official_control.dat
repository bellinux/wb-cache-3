King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885.

The local French lieutenant governor moved to St. Louis in 1765 and began awarding land grants. As part of the peace negotiations to end the Seven Years' War, Spain gained control of Louisiana according to the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1762.

40|$|Legislation on <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> {{requires}} {{competent authorities}} {{to carry out}} a risk-based control in a uniform way. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether data from <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> can be used to examine to what extent the assessment of compliance is performed in a uniform way. Data from <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> carried out by a competent authority were examined for differences in the assessment of non-compliance amongst the control staff. The dissemination of non-compliance within a selection of regulatory requirements was also examined. The result shows that the proportion non-compliances increase when more than one inspector is present. Inspectors carrying out fewer controls show significant differences in their assessment of compliance with certain requirements. Under certain conditions dispersion measures based on the proportion of non-compliances can be used as indicators or comparative figures for consistency...|$|R
5|$|The 2nd Commando Regiment, {{then known}} as 4 RAR (Cdo), was {{deployed}} {{as a part of}} the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR in East Timor, 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to East Timor continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising from the existing two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel. This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit. The battalion took <b>official</b> <b>control</b> over Area of Operations (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman.|$|E

This paper develops an alternative technique for measuring the cost of undertaking disguised capital flows when such <b>official</b> <b>controls</b> are present. This measure is derived from an intertemporal, optimizing model of an open economy incorporating the influence of the authorities’ foreign exchange market activities. The paper suggests that the real cost of undertaking disguised capital flows declined on average by nearly 70 percent between the early 1970 s and the late 1980 s. ...|$|R

Australia had been suffering a drought since 1937, but this ended as it rained in every match the MCC played on tour, including tropical thunderstorms twice in Brisbane and again in Sydney.

After owner Jerry Moyes petitioned the club into bankruptcy against the league's wishes, so as to sell the team to Jim Balsillie who plans to move the team to Hamilton, Ontario, the league challenged the right of Moyes to file for bankruptcy. In the documents filed with the Phoenix bankruptcy court, the NHL stated that the league took <b>official</b> <b>control</b> of the team on November 14, 2008. The league then began advancing money to the club from league revenues, and made a loan to the club in February 2009, for a combined estimated total of $44.5 million over the full season. During the season, commissioner Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly had made a series of denials and obfuscations, while firing the Coyotes CEO and laying off 18 Coyotes employees. Moyes' documents filed with the court indicated that the team had lost $73 million over the last three years, and that the projected loss was $45 million for 2008–09.|$|E
