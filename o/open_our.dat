25|$|The {{truth is}} there is more of Cubism in great {{painting}} than we dream, and the extravagances of the Cubists may serve to <b>open</b> <b>our</b> eyes to beauties we have always felt without quite understanding.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we <b>open</b> <b>our</b> eyes.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's most scathing {{criticism}} {{is directed at}} the Pope, in the lines: [...] "While the Pope owns 51% of General Motors / And the stock exchange {{is the only thing}} he's qualified to quote us." [...] Contrasting this statement with Harrison's song-wide message that God [...] "waits on us to wake up and <b>open</b> <b>our</b> hearts", Allison concludes: [...] "whereas the Lord is about the business of helping human beings to wake up, the Pope is about the business of business." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Gloaming (Softly <b>Open</b> <b>our</b> Mouths in the Cold)" [...] is an {{electronic}} song with [...] "mechanical rhythms" [...] that Jonny Greenwood built from tape loops. Greenwood {{described it as}} [...] "very old school electronica: no computers, just analogue synths, tape machines, and sellotape." [...] Yorke felt the song was [...] "the most explicit protest song on the record... I feel really strongly that it's about the rise of fascism, {{and the rise of}} intolerance and bigotry and fear, {{and all the things that}} keep a population down." [...] "There There (The Boney King of Nowhere)" [...] is a guitar-led rock song with layered percussion building to a loud climax. It was influenced by krautrock band Can, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Pixies.|$|E
500|$|... "Dve liri (ne ni bilo pišano)" [...] (...) {{contains}} lyrics sang by a {{woman for}} her past lover. It represents a song entrusted from a grandmother to her granddaughter to be played as her wedding song. Although the grandmother has passed way and has not heard the song played at her granddaughter's wedding, the granddaughter i.e. the song's protagonist, fulfills her wish and uses two lire to order a song from the band playing music at the wedding of her ex-lover to which she is partaking as an invitee. [...] "Ke pijam ljubov do kraj" [...] (...) has joyful lyrics about love and according to Bečković, it is musically similar to the playful rhythm typical of bosa nova {{due to the fact}} that Gočeva is accompanied by fast horns and a double bass. In the song, the female protagonist sings about a [...] "blazing kiss". The song [...] "Son" [...] (...) contains a [...] "fairy tale-like" [...] atmosphere. It describes a [...] "fleeting beauty once we <b>open</b> <b>our</b> eyes" [...] and how real life is different from a dream, as portrayed in the lyrics [...] "Pusta ostana želba nevina, son si mina i ti si zamina... Ne znam koj e kriv, Bože daj mi zdiv" [...] (...) [...] The cover versions of [...] "Te vidov i se zaljubiv" [...] (...) and [...] "Ako zgrešam neka izgoram" [...] (...) are characterized by arrangements which differ significantly from the original versions and rhythmically match the music atmosphere of the album.|$|E
2500|$|He also views American {{immigration}} laws as too restrictive and damaging to economic output: [...] "It is pure idiocy that Congress will not <b>open</b> <b>our</b> borders – {{as wide as}} possible– to attract and keep the world's first-round intellectual draft choices {{in an age when}} everyone increasingly has the same innovation tools and the key differentiator is human talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Named after Saint Augustine of Hippo, {{an early}} Christian theologian, St. Augustine teaches young men within the {{framework}} of the Catholic faith and in the Augustinian tradition.

2500|$|Beckham {{suffers from}} obsessive {{compulsive}} disorder (OCD), which he says makes him [...] "have everything {{in a straight line}} or everything has to be in pairs." [...] Victoria Beckham claims, [...] "If you <b>open</b> <b>our</b> fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first film}} {{to result from}} this new semi-narrative phase, The Last of England told {{the death of a}} country, ravaged by its own {{internal}} decay and the economic restructuring of Thatcher's government. [...] "Wrenchingly beautiful…the film {{is one of the few}} commanding works of personal cinema in the late 80's – a call to <b>open</b> <b>our</b> eyes to a world violated by greed and repression, to see what irrevocable damage has been wrought on city, countryside and soul, how our skies, our bodies, have turned poisonous", wrote a Village Voice critic.|$|E

2500|$|Paul VI was {{the first}} pope to receive an Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey in {{official}} audience as Head of Church, after the private audience visit of Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher to Pope John XXIII on 2 December 1960. [...] Ramsey met Paul three times during his visit and opened the Anglican Centre in Rome to increase their mutual knowledge. [...] He praised Paul VI and his contributions {{in the service of}} unity. Paul replied that [...] "by entering into our house, you are entering your own house, we are happy to <b>open</b> <b>our</b> door and heart to you." [...] The two Church leaders signed a common declaration, which {{put an end to the}} disputes of the past and outlined a common agenda for the future.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} gained {{national attention}} when Lou Ann Zelenik, a Tennessee Republican Party {{candidate for the}} vacant representative's seat in Tennessee's 6th congressional district, issued a statement in opposition. On June 24, 2010, Zelenik denounced the planned mosque as [...] "an Islamic training center," [...] {{saying that it was}} not a bona fide religious institution but a political one [...] "designed to fracture the moral and political foundation of Middle Tennessee". She declared: [...] "Until the American Muslim community find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil, radical counterparts, to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them, we are not obligated to <b>open</b> <b>our</b> society to any of them." [...] Ben Lemming, a Democrat candidate for the same seat, was one of the few Tennessee politicians to support the mosque project, stating: [...] "The Americans that want to build this mosque are already our neighbors. They live next to us and they are a part of our community. They are not the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "If {{we look to}} the laws, they afford equal {{justice to}} all in their private differences...if a man is able to serve the state, he is not {{hindered}} by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbour for doing what he likes..." [...] These lines form {{the roots of the}} famous phrase [...] "equal justice under law." [...] The liberality of which Pericles spoke also extended to Athens' foreign policy: [...] "We throw <b>open</b> <b>our</b> city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality..." [...] Yet Athens' values of equality and openness do not, according to Pericles, hinder Athens' greatness, indeed, they enhance it, [...] "...advancement in public life falls to reputations for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit...our ordinary citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair judges of public matters...at Athens we live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger." ...|$|E

2500|$|An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier {{answers the}} {{question}} [...] "What is Riot grrrl?" [...] with: [...] " [...] Because we girls {{want to create}} mediums that speak to US. [...] We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because {{we need to talk}} to each other. Communication and inclusion are key. [...] We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can <b>open</b> <b>our</b> eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. [...] All three of these forms were claimed {{to be a source of}} empowerment for women in the movement.|$|E
2500|$|Biblical and {{literary}} scholars {{have noted that}} chapter and verse numbering disguises the actual form of the biblical writings and interferes with the act of reading. Ernest Sutherland Bates wrote, [...] "Certainly, no literary format was ever less conducive to pleasure or understanding than is the curious and complicated panoply in which the Scriptures have come down to us. [...] None but a work of transcendent literary genius could have survived such a handicap at all." [...] Richard Moulton noted, [...] "We are all agreed {{to speak of the}} Bible as a supremely great literature. [...] Yet, when we <b>open</b> <b>our</b> ordinary editions, we look in vain for the lyrics, epics, dramas, essays, sonnets, treatises, which make the other great literatures of the world; instead of these the eye catches nothing but a monotonous uniformity of numbered sentences." [...] New Testament scholar Hermann von Soden urged publishers, [...] "It is high time, in any editions that wish to facilitate rather than impede readers' understanding of the New Testament writings, for not only the verse divisions… but also the conventional chapter divisions to disappear completely from the text. Without giving any consideration to these divisions, the text must be printed {{in a way that will}} illustrate visually what units the authors themselves created within their works." ...|$|E
2500|$|The LDS temple rituals {{formerly}} {{provided an}} example in which capital punishment is contemplated for violation of historical blood oaths in the Endowment ritual. The blood oaths in the ceremony related to protecting the ritual's secrecy. In {{keeping with the}} idea that grievous crimes must be answered with bloodshed and that blood atonement should be voluntary, participants made an oath that rather than ever revealing the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would rather have [...] "my throat ... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots"; [...] "our breasts ... be torn <b>open,</b> <b>our</b> hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field"; [...] "your body ... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out" [...] showing an entire refusal to accept the promises made in the washing and anointing ordinances. The gory wording was removed early in the 20th century and changed to a less explicit reference to [...] "different ways in which life may be taken." [...] Vestigial accompanying suggestive gestures were removed by the LDS Church in 1990 [...] However the temple ceremony still states that [...] "under no condition, even at the peril of your life, will you ever divulge" [...] information regarding the rituals. There are no documented instances of a person who has been killed for violating these oaths of secrecy.|$|E
5000|$|Of Ewald's theory: [...] "It <b>opens</b> <b>our</b> eyes to many quite weird {{possibilities}} about {{disease that}} most medical scientists, tending to {{be unaware of}} current evolutionary thought, don't think of." [...] — evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton.|$|R
5000|$|... "We <b>opened</b> <b>our</b> columns to everyone. Even to Rashid al-Ghannushi (Islamist) and to Mohamed Harmel (Communist), {{while not}} {{supporting}} their positions. We did {{this in the}} name of free expression. I even published an editorial which defended the extremists.|$|R
5000|$|A {{member of}} the Dutch {{underground}} said about Musa Dagh: [...] "It was a 'textbook' for us. It <b>opened</b> <b>our</b> eyes and spelled out for us what might happen, although {{we did not know}} what in fact would occur." ...|$|R
