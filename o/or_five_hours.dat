5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours,</b> hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E

He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.|$|E

25|$|Cable cars rapidly {{spread to}} other cities, {{although}} the major attraction for most was the ability to displace horsecar (or mule-drawn) systems rather than the ability to climb hills.

500|$|By the 1830s, the Sherwoods {{had become}} more prosperous and the family decided {{to travel to the}} continent. The texts that Sherwood wrote {{following}} this trip reflect her exposure to French culture in particular.

2500|$|To make up {{for this}} disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp {{administrator}} said in a meeting: [...] "There are cases when a prisoner is given only four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity." [...] In {{the words of a}} former Gulag prisoner: [...] "By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead." [...] The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.|$|E

Years later, Bourguiba recounted that experience saying: [...] "It was in 1907, such a journey at that time was not that easy. It was a real expedition. We went to Sousse thanks to a diligence that belonged to a Maltese named Carlo.
