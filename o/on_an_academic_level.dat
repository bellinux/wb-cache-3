40|$|Much of {{the debate}} about {{inequality}} in globalising informational economies {{has focused on the}} future role of information in social development processes.

40|$|A much-discussed {{topic in}} the media is that an {{increasing}} number of children and adolescents has become perfectionists and set too high expectations for themselves. In addition to striving for good grades in school it is also important for them to perform in all other arenas. This paper explores the different meanings that mothers and young adolescent girls give to the terms self-representation, self- realization and criticism. The analysis of the study focuses on the elementary school, Virum Skole, as an extreme case for representation of a resourceful and homogenous milieu. Virum Skole is chosen based upon factors as the school’s location in an especially affluent area, the school’s emphasis <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high <b>academic</b> <b>level</b> {{and the fact that the}} school has a very homogenous group of families. The analysis focuses on interviews done with two mothers with children in Virum Skole and three 7 th grade girls from the school. Through Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory and Rasmus Willig’s thesis about a tendency to self-criticism rather than criticism of society, the empirical data is examined. Through analysis of the mothers’ and girls’ ascribing of meaning to the terms self- representation, self-realization and criticism it can be concluded that these are affected by competitiveness. This can, among other things, be seen through the girls’ use of the social media, Instagram, for self-representation, that the homogenous milieu means <b>an</b> increased focus <b>on</b> very small variations to the norm, and that both mothers and girls ascribe a meaning of high school and university to the notion of “future”. Furthermore, it is established, through analysis and discussion, that the girls interviewed serve as representatives for the pupil group “straight-A-girls” rather than representatives for teenage girls of a homogenous, resourceful milieu...|$|R
40|$|Dentistry in Sweden is {{predicted}} to have a shortage of dentists {{in the future and}} the division of labour within dentistry will be a more debated question. In order to forecast the effects of such a shortage the professional status of the involved groups must be made clearer. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyse the emergence and present professional status of clinical dental professions in Sweden. The study was conducted on the basis of theories on professions, and their roles in organizations was analysed. The results were applied on the historical emergence, establishment and consolidation of clinical dental professions in Sweden. The results show that a large sector of salaried dentists has not diminished the professional status of the Swedish dentists. Professional ambitions such as many clinical subspecialties and a strong element of research have not been restrained by the public health ambitions in the Public Dental Health Service (PDHS). Presently, other dental professions are dental hygienists, dental technicians and dental nurses. Of these the only other licensed group, the dental hygienists, are an emerging profession. They have an uphill struggle to obtain a full professional status, mainly because their knowledge domains are neither specific nor exclusive to their group. Development of a common core curriculum <b>on</b> <b>a</b> clearly <b>academic</b> <b>level</b> would enhance their professional status. Dental technicians and nurses are lacking fundamental traits as professions. There appears to be little need for additional groups of clinical professions besides dentists and dental hygienists in Swedish dentistry. In conclusion,this analysis provided better understanding of the present status of the Swedish dental professions, to prepare for future restructuring of the dental care system. Further work will be needed to understand the impact of professional traits on the management of groups of professionals...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} this thesis {{developed}} from two major concerns. The first, on the macro scale, {{deals with the}} problem of a deteriorating central business district of a small city. The second issue deals specifically with the housing needs, both physical and psychological, of the senior citizen. The proposal is designed to satisfy the needs of both of these issues; revitalizing the town and the people by integrating within the CBD, housing, new shops, offices, student housing, parking and a public meeting space. The town benefits from renewed business revenues and civic pride, as does the elderly individual from his proximity to physicians, stores, entertainment, and government offices. Admittedly, the problems of urban neglect cannot be solved <b>on</b> <b>an</b> architectural level alone, but it can provide the initial confidence required to stem the exodus from our urban centers to satellite malls. It is not suggested that this project alone will revitalize the CBD of Crawfordsville, Indiana, but that it act as an inspiration to private developers and entrepreneurs. The project specifically deals with the idea of community involvement as a method of discouraging senility and withdrawal in the senior citizen. Shared community facilities, apartment entrances, and dining room encourage interaction between the residents and local senior citizenry. The need for privacy is also acknowledged by private balconies and individual kitchen units which allow the residents to retain their autonomy. Even these so-called "private" balconies, however, discourage withdrawal by allowing the resident to "people watch" in the public space on the ground level below. This study investigated the compatibility of elderly housing and urban environment <b>on</b> purely <b>an</b> <b>academic</b> <b>level,</b> but I feel that the results warrant additional study and development. The needs of the senior citizen can best be provided in an urban environment and the city, in turn, can benefit from the introduction of a full time residential community and it's accompanying economic advantages.

40|$|Introduction: In 2007 {{a master}} program in sexology was started within {{the faculty of}} Health and Society at Malmö University, Sweden. The aim {{of the program is}} to offer {{training}} <b>on</b> <b>an</b> advanced <b>academic</b> <b>level,</b> according to the Bologna process, to professionals in health care, schools, clinical centers, etc. Moreover, the program aims at attracting students who are interested in a future research career within the field of sexology and sexuality studies. Thus the program focuses on promoting in-depth knowledge about sexuality as a phenomenon and about sexology as a field of practice and science from an interdisciplinary perspective. Special attention is given to the significance of different cultural perspectives on sexuality and also to how research, teaching and training within the sexological field are shaped by the fact that Scandinavian societies today are characterized by ethnic and cultural diversity. The program is closely linked to the research program Gender, Sexuality and Social work at the same faculty (www. mah. se/hs/kssa), which contains different areas of research in the social science field. The members of the resarch program participate as teachers in the master program. Overall the group of teachers and researchers attached to the program are engaged in developing the contents of sexology as field of knowledge and research and its relations to practical and clinical sexological work. Questions: Which pedagogical and theoretical methods and models have been used at the master program? What studies are being conducted within the research program Gender, Sexuality and Social Work? Conclusions: The pedagogical aim is to combine different learning methods in order to adapt new theoretical aspects of sexology, learn new models for working with sexual health in different areas and to reflect among values and attitudes concerning sexuality. Theories from different perspective of sexuality are used, but according to the aim of the program is the social constructive theory especially useful. Lectures are combined with discussions, group papers connected to the theme of the course and individual papers. The students are seen as competent sources that are increasing the level of learning by contributing with their special knowledge in different areas. The research program consist of studies within the fields of prostitution and trafficking, sexuality and violence, homosexuality, hiv and hiv-prevention, masculinities and mens’ parenthood, youth and sexuality, sexuality and disability, treatment of sex offenders, ethnical relations and sexuality, pornography and sexual exposure...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the contested}} label of “Web 2. 0 ” was put forward in 2004, the hype and buzz around it spread {{enormously}} both <b>on</b> <b>a</b> media and <b>academic</b> <b>level.</b> In particular, literature on Web 2. 0 and its tools is often either driven by deterministic assumptions, or presents partial {{accounts of the}} issue. Indeed, many discourses surrounding Web 2. 0 embed “narratives of inevitability and technological determinism” (Bigge, 2006 : 1) and belong to {{a long history of}} studies on the web and networked communication technologies that often have claimed a “revolutionary” role of the next new medium, a history that usually saw the failure of those claims, which should be challenged once and for all. However, many critical studies that would be expected to debunk the “dominant rhetorics” of Web 2. 0 in fact partially accomplish the mission, since they often fail to properly account for all the aspects of Web 2. 0. I will propose a "theoretical remediation" (Beer, 2008) by adopting the theoretical framework of Science and Technology Studies, and in particular, the perspective of Actor-Network Theory (ANT). Within this framework and perspective, I will investigate in my study of the Social Networking Site Myspace and some of its underground music-related users whether and how the alleged processes of democratization, user empowerment and active participation can be retrieved. I carried out my study with the methodology of cyberethnography, and, more specifically with participant observation and in-depth interviews. I conclude by highlighting how, in light of my work, Web 2. 0 could be properly called "the industry of participation", for highlighting how user participation is not completely voluntary and aware, but instead, embedded into business processes. Also, a “missing democratization” emerged from my research...|$|R
