40|$|Abstract. The <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> waste {{management}} was always {{one of the}} biggest problems in agricultural and environmental sector. Besides, everyone can observe that the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> industries produce every year more that 10 million tons of waste including wastewaters and solid waste (leaves, dry pomace). It is given attention to the challenges which exist for waste treatment (there are different cases) and of course following the different legal frameworks at European and National level. Cause of the increase of the amount of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mills</b> waste every year, it’s necessary to increase the awareness of the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mills</b> stakeholders encouraging them in sustainable olive mill waste (OMW) management, always with cooperation of the public services and research centers for positive solutions. The OMW management is becoming a critical issue for the sustainability of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> industry, because of the increasing quantities generated, the public environmental awareness and stricter environmental laws.

40|$|The {{complexity}} and turbulence {{of the current}} business environment determines that the way of acquiring sustainable competitive advantages is ever more strongly associated with possession of intangible elements, and not focused as before on tangible assets. Faced with this panorama accounting {{does not seem to}} offer a very comprehensive response in its treatment of this type of asset, and intangible accounting could be defined as incomplete. Businesses themselves, convinced of the importance of intangibles, even complete their own accounting information in this respect.

This is the highest concentration of such work in one place.

40|$|Catalytic wet air {{oxidation}} using heterogeneous catalysts is {{a promising}} technology {{for treatment of}} wastewaters. Wastewaters from <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mills</b> are difficult to clean because effluents contain high levels of phenolic compounds that cannot be removed by biological treatment or incineration. Therefore, we tested the catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, as model molecule of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>mills</b> wastewaters, over Ru-supported CeO 2 –TiO 2 mixed oxides. We focussed on the Ce/Ti molar ratio because this ratio modifies {{the properties of the}} Ru catalysts. Supports were prepared by using the sol–gel method. The Ru catalysts were prepared by impregnation. Those products were characterized by N 2 adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma. Catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was performed in a batch reactor at 140  °C and 50  bar of air. Our results show that the most efficient catalyst was Ru with a Ce/Ti ratio of 1 / 5, which converted totally p-hydroxybenzoic after 7  h of reaction without Ru leaching. We explain this finding by an enhanced dispersion of Ru due to better structural properties of the CeO 2 –TiO 2 support. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Twenty measurement points were identified inside the <b>oil</b> <b>mill</b> plant area where the machines for <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> extraction were located (about 200 m 2). The instrument used for the measurements was a precision integrating portable sound level meter, class 1, model HD 2110 L by Delta OHM, Italy. The measured sound levels exceeded the limits allowed by the regulations in all the measurement points inside the working area; values exceeding the threshold limit of 80 dB(A) were recorded coming up to a maximum value of 93. 3 dB(A) close to the hammer crusher. The operators involved are consequently obliged to wear the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment...|$|R
