The starting plant material was obtained from cuttings of R. officinalis growing spontaneously on granitic silt soil (Northern Gallura). Cuttings {{were divided into two}} homogeneous groups and planted in two different kinds of soil: one predominantly silt with granite and the other with a highly calcareous content (Sassari). The different character of the soil had a significant effect on the yield and composition of the oil. Plants grown in granitic silt soil appeared more luxuriant and had a more intense aroma than those grown in calcareous soil which, on the contrary, showed evident signs of chlorosis. The main difference in the composition of the oil was a higher percentage of oxygenated components in plants grown in calcareous soil. The main constituent of the oxygenated fraction was 1, 8 -cineole, reaching up to 31 % in samples from rosemary grown on calcareous soil. This is particularly surprising since the oil obtained from R. officinalis, which grows naturally in calcareous soil, usually contains markedly lower levels of 1, 8 -cineole than oil from plants grown in granitic silt.

The ear type did not affect the TAM and predominated ears score B regardless of the type. In the evaluation of the treatment for experimental otitis groups I, II and V had an increase in clinical score until the fourth day then decreased gradually. Groups III and IV had the scores lower tha day 0 for almost all experimental period. Group III showed a progressive decrease; group II showed the highest score at days four and six and the group V at day ten. There was hyperplasia in all groups at the end of the experiment, and in groups II and IV it was more frequent. All groups had otitis with predominantly histiocytic infiltrate at the beginning, although at 10 days with a suppurative infiltration in groups II, III and V. In healthy ears at four days, all groups showed an increase of clinical scores, which was higher in groups I (2. 6), II (3. 6) and III (2. 4), but only the essential <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> 25 % in propylene glycol was topically irritant. There was a progressive decrease of the scores in groups I, II and III starting at day four and at day 10 the highest score was observed in groups I (2. 0) and II (2. 0). It is concluded that the pH of the ear canal of dogs is neutral and can acidify with increased amount of cerumen; the average ear temperature is lower than the rectal temperature by 1. 53 °C± 0. 75 and the conformation of the ear does not influence the average ear temperature; aqueous extract of Rosmarinus officinalis L. 25 % and aqueous extract of Triticum vulgare 0. 2 % reduced the clinical scores, while the essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L. 25 % is not effective in noninfectious otitis externa in Wistar rats and the aqueous extract of Rosmarinus officinalis L. 25 % and the aqueous extract of Triticum vulgare 0. 2 % are non-irritating topics, while the essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L. 25 % irritates the auditory epithelium. Objetivou-se avaliar o microclima do canal auditivo de cães e determinar o efeito do Rosmarinus officinalis L. (alecrim) e do Triticum vulgare (trigo) em orelhas hígidas e no tratamento da otite externa experimental não infecciosa de ratos Wistar. Para análise do microclima do canal auditivo foram considerados 141 cães hígidos, destes 30 utilizados para avaliação do pH do canal auditivo e 111 para aferição das temperaturas auditivas. Os cães foram distribuídos em dois grupos de acordo com a quantidade de cerúmem ausente a leve e moderado a intenso e o canal auditivo foi lavado para aferição do pH. A diferença entre a temperatura retal (TR), aferida com termômetro coluna de mercúrio e a temperatura auditiva média (TAM), aferida com termômetro infravermelho, foi avaliada para classificação em escores: A=TAM<TR em até 1, 2 ºC e B=TAM<TR em mais de 1, 2 ºC, relacionando-as com a conformação da orelha. Para avaliação do efeito dos extratos vegetais na otite externa, 64 ratos Wistar foram submetidos à inoculação no conduto auditivo de 80 µL de óleo de cróton 5 % em acetona e, em 24 h as orelhas foram avaliadas por escore clínico. Os animais foram divididos em cinco grupos, sendo o tratamento tópico realizado por até sete dias com extrato aquoso de alecrim 25 % em propilenoglicol (grupo I), óleo essencial de alecrim 25 % em propilenoglicol (grupo II), extrato aquoso de trigo 0, 2 % em propilenoglicol (grupo III), propilenoglicol (grupo IV) e com NaCl 0, 9 % (grupo V). Aos quatro (4 d), seis (6 d) e dez dias (10 d) as orelhas de quatro animais de cada grupo foram avaliadas clinicamente e, os mesmos foram eutanasiados para histopatologia. A avaliação do efeito dos extratos vegetais na orelha hígida foi realizada utilizando 48 ratos Wistar, os quais foram distribuídos em cinco grupos de acordo com o tratamento, conforme descrito acima e classificados em escore clínico. Na análise do microclima do canal auditivo observou-se que o pH variou de 5, 0 a 8, 0 e houve correlação negativa entre quantidade de cerúmen e pH (p= 0, 0271). Ainda, o tipo de orelha não influenciou a TAM e predominaram orelhas no escore B independente do tipo. Na avaliação do tratatmento da otite externa experimental os grupos I, II e V aumentaram os escores aos quatro dias, em seguida decresceram. Os grupos III e IV mantiveram os escores menores que o dia zero por quase todo o período experimental. O grupo III apresentou diminuição progressiva, o II apresentou o escore mais elevado aos quarto e seis dias e o grupo V aos 10 dias. Havia hiperplasia em todos os grupos e no final do experimento, nos grupos II e IV em maior freqüência. Todos os grupos tinham otite no início com predomínio de infiltrado histiocitário, embora aos 10 dias com infiltrado supurativo nos grupos II, III e V. Nas orelhas hígidas aos quatro dias, todos os grupos apresentaram aumento dos escores clínicos sendo maior nos grupos I(2, 6), II(3, 6) e III(2, 4), porém somente o óleo essencial de alecrim 25 % em propilenoglicol apresentou efeito irritante tópico. Houve uma diminuição progressiva dos escores nos grupos I, II e III a partir do dia quatro e no dia 10 o maior escore foi observado nos grupos I (2, 0) e II (2, 0). Concluise que o pH do canal auditivo de cães é neutro e pode acidificar com o aumeno da quantidade de cerúmen; a temperatura auditiva média é menor que a retal 1, 53 °C± 0, 75 e a conformação da orelha não influencia na temperatura auditiva média em cães; o extrato aquoso de Rosmarinus oficinalis L. 25 % e o extrato aquoso de Triticum vulgare 0, 2 % reduzem os escores clínicos, enquanto o óleo essencial do Rosmarinus oficinalis L. 25 % não é efetivo na otite externa não infecciosa em ratos Wistar e, o extrato aquoso de R. officinalis L. 25 % e o extrato aquoso de T. vulgare 0, 2 % não são irritantes tópicos, enquanto que o óleo essencial de R. officinalis L. 25 % irrita o epitélio auditivo...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Many {{aromatic}} plants are today considered {{as the most}} important sources for the extraction of compounds with strong antioxidant activity. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L., Lamiaceae) is one of the spices widely used in folk medicine, cosmetics, phytopharmacy, and for flavoring food products (Fadel and El-Massry 2000). The genus Rosmarinus L. or <b>Rosemary</b> consists <b>of</b> a few species of aromatic shrubs native to the Mediterranean region. The best known species R. officinalis L. or Common Rosemary has been widely cultivated since antiquity as a herb and garden plant. Furthermore, rosemary is the only spice commercially available for use as an antioxidant in Europe and the United States, marketed in an oil soluble form, in dry powder, and also in water dispersible or water miscible formulations. Phenolic compounds such as carnosol, carnosoic acid, rosmanol, rosmadial, epirosmanol, rosmadiphenol, rosmarinic acid, etc. are considered to have antioxidant activity. However, data regarding this activity <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rosemary</b> are not abundant and the methods for determination and to estimate their antioxidant activity as potential sources of natural antioxidants. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the essential <b>oil</b> profile <b>of</b> several varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis, usually not used for food, and to estimate their antioxidant activity as potential sources of natural antioxidants. Methodology: Essential oils were distilled from the aerial parts of Rosmarinus x. Noeanus and subspecies of Rosmarinus officinalis: 1. R. officinalis Israeli; 2. R. officinalis Majorca pink; 3. R. officinalis Blue rain; 4. R. officinalis Alba; 5. R. officinalis Corsican blue, cultivated in the CRA Sanremo, Italy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis <b>of</b> the essential <b>oils</b> were carried out using GC-MS system. The antioxidant activity was determined by using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method (Benzie & Strain, 1996) and in terms of hydrogen-donating or radical scavenging ability, using the stable radical DPPH (Brand-Williams et al. 1995). Results and conclusion: Monoterpene hydrocarbones are abundant in Rosmarinus x noeanus, R. officinalis alba and R. officinalis blue rain¸ while the other species are rich in oxygenated monoterpenes. Sesquiterpenes are not more than 2 % in all the examined EOs. Camphor is presented in every subspecies in a range between 15 % in R. officinalis Alba and 42 % for Majorca pink, while the amount of myrcene ranges between 0. 9 %(R. officinalis Majorca pink) to 30 % (R. officinalis alba). R. x noeanus showed the highest antioxidant activity both with FRAP and DPPH IC 50 assay two fold the observed value in R. officinalis Israeli. Among the different subvarieties of R. officinalis, the Israeli produced the highest antioxidant activity, two times higher then that observed in R. officinalis Majorca pink and R. officinalis Corsican blue (FRAP method). The different antioxidant activity is confirmed by the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) od DPPH method...|$|R

The diverse composition <b>of</b> the essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> different <b>rosemary's</b> ecotypes {{in a given}} area may modify their level of activity. This preliminary study intends highlight the complex relationships between chemical composition and biotypes and/or chemotypes. The chernioll composition <b>of</b> the essential <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> Rosmarinus officinalis L. was obtained for three wild populations sampled in the Requend-Utiel uplands (Western Valencia, East Spain) in February and distributed in an altitudinal gradient (400, 900 and 12021 m. a. s. I.). The relationship between bioclimatic indexes, soil characteristics and oil composition were determined throat* linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to both ecological and essential oil data set components. Twenty-eight main compounds were identified in the oils. The essential <b>oil</b> composition <b>of</b> the three plant populations appeared quite different and allotted to identify three different chemotypes. The Eucalyptol chemotype (36 % eucalyptol, 17 % camphor, 13 % a-pinene) shooed a positive relationship with higher mean annual temperature, higher minimal temperature of the coldest month, and pow nutrient content of soil, which were characteristics of the lowest altitude. At higher altitudes, the camphor chemotype { 31 camphor, 24 % eucalyptol, 11 % a-pinene) related to the higher soil nutrient content and water balance in plants and soils„, and higher minimal temperature of the coldest month.
