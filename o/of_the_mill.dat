5|$|The {{consortium}} took possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> in November 1979. The {{first priority}} {{was to make}} the mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> {{temperature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beaker {{is often}} determined on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beaker, {{which can be}} done for example with temperature data loggers [12, 15] or thermocouples [13, 16]. However, the temperature on the surface {{is not necessarily the}} temperature inside <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beaker, and a temperature difference between milling beaker and balls of 25  K was reported [13]. For determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> balls´ temperature, calorimetric measurements can be performed [5, 13]. The Lamaty group developed a mathematical model for <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> wall´s temperature. Experimental and simulated results (MBM MM 200, operated at 30  s− 1 with 10  ml steel vessels) were in good accordance.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{a method}} called “house-building frame {{modeling}} ” {{based on the}} APDL language is introduced firstly, and the finite element model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> distortion analysis is established for a platform structure with 192 frames by the method, and <b>the</b> prediction analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> distortion under different milling conditions is carried out, by means of 3 -D finite element simulation technology. Comparing the simulation results and <b>the</b> measurement ones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> distortion, <b>the</b> proposed model is modified; the modeling method and prediction method are proved to be effective...|$|R

5|$|The Allenville Mill Storehouse {{was long}} {{considered}} to be the Allenville Mill, including in the 1937 Federal Writer's Project book, but records indicate this was the storehouse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> constructed in 1813. Despite not being the mill complex, the storehouse is the earliest surviving example of the 19th-century company storehouses in Rhode Island, and one of only a few surviving examples of company storehouses remaining from the 19th century. Furthermore, the property was erected and owned by the Governor of Rhode Island and later United States Senator Phillip Allen. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.|$|E

A tributary joins from the south, which once drove Moat Mill. The mill house dates from the seventeenth century, is timber framed and has been faced with red brick on the ground floor while the attached three-storey mill building dates from the following century. It has been converted into a house, although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> machinery is still present, but has been isolated from the living space by glass panels.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of union radicals in the Industrial Workers of the World, Disque sponsored an alternative union based on patriotism and labor–management cooperation. The new union, the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, was established in 1917 and put {{under the leadership of}} Portland attorney Captain Maurice E. Crumpacker, who would later serve as a U.S. Congressman. The union was initially opposed by both labor and mill owners, but due to Disque's strong advocacy, within six months nearly all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> owners had agreed to support the union; by October 1918, it had 125,000members. In fact, the union lasted 20 years longer than the Spruce Production Division.|$|E
5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b> The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{financing}} <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> proved troublesome.

Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|Gilkeson {{served on}} the board of {{directors}} as the first president of the Bank of Romney after it was granted its charter by the West Virginia Legislature on September 3, 1888, and was opened later on December 20, 1888. During Gilkeson's tenure as president, the Bank of Romney occupied two rooms on the ground floor of the Wirgman Building, where the city's previous bank, the Bank of the Valley of Virginia, was located prior to the American Civil War. Gilkeson served as the president of the Bank of Romney until his retirement in 1913, when he was succeeded by John J. Cornwell, 15th Governor of West Virginia. In November 1906, Gilkeson, R.W.

5|$|Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's {{trouble with}} her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b> That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching {{in the corner of the}} room, and panics.

5|$|On {{the death}} of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George {{inherited}} the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry {{until his death in}} 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles Dolman, Peter Dolman, David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and an acre of land cost £6,000.|$|E
5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b> Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than it did when the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park.|$|E
5|$|The River Rother {{rises from}} several springs near Empshott in Hampshire. The main one {{supplies}} watercress beds, before passing under Mill Lane, {{to the south}} of the village. It continues eastwards, to reach Greatham Mill. The mill, together with the mill house and an attached barn, date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, and are built of brick. Now Grade II listed. All of the original machinery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> is still in situ, but is not operational, as the water supply has been diverted. The stream turns to the south-east, and passes under the A3 West Liss bypass, and Greatham Bridge, on the old route. It is joined by other streams, and turns south to reach Liss railway station. The railway and the river follow the same general route, and the river crosses under the railway five times before reaching Sheet. At the northern edge of the village, the river is joined by the Ashford Stream, and there is another mill. After passing under the A272 road, to the east of the village, it reaches Sheet Mill.|$|E
