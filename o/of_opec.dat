5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{consider that}} the United States was a de facto member <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> during its formal occupation of Iraq, due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003–2004. But this is not {{borne out by the}} minutes <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> meetings, as no US representative attended in an official capacity.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was not a part <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 through 1981, {{the total}} current account surplus for all members <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> {{amounted}} to US$450billion, without scaling-up for the subsequent decades of inflation. Ninety {{percent of this}} surplus was accumulated by the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf and Libya, with Iran also accumulating significant oil surpluses through 1978 before suffering the hardships of revolution, war and sanctions.|$|E

50|$|In December 2010, he was {{appointed}} oil minister, replacing Hussain Al Shahristani, to the cabinet headed by prime minister Nouri Maliki. Luaibi {{was part of the}} Iraqi National Alliance. He acted as the president <b>of</b> <b>OPEC's</b> 162th ordinary meeting which was held in Vienna on 12 December 2012.|$|R
5|$|The {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> {{marked a}} turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E
25|$|Since 1960, as a {{founding}} member <b>of</b> <b>OPEC,</b> its oil pricing policy has been generally to stabilize the world oil market and try to moderate sharp price movements so as to not jeopardise the Western economies.|$|E

25|$|His {{position}} on the Coal Board was often mentioned later by those introducing Schumacher or his ideas. It is generally thought that his farsighted planning contributed to Britain's post-war economic recovery. Schumacher predicted the rise <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> {{and many of the}} problems of nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the decline}} in prices and {{economic}} and geopolitical power <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> came from the move to alternate energy sources. OPEC had relied on price inelasticity to maintain high consumption, but had underestimated the extent to which conservation and other sources of supply would eventually reduce demand. Electricity generation from nuclear power and natural gas, home heating from natural gas, and ethanol-blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil.|$|E
25|$|The embargo was a {{response}} to American involvement in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Six days after Egypt and Syria launched a surprise military campaign against Israel, the US supplied Israel with arms. In response to this, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> plus Egypt and Syria) announced an oil embargo against Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics of}} Western {{military}} intervention suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real {{impetus for the}} intervention, among them a journalist of London Arab nationalist newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the Russian TV network RT and the (then-)leaders of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Hugo Chávez and Robert Mugabe. Gaddafi's Libya, despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly {{in the form of}} oil reserves and financial capital. Libya is a member <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> and one of the world's largest oil producers. It was producing roughly 1.6 million barrels a day before the war, nearly 70 percent of them through the state-owned National Oil Corporation. Additionally, the country's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, was {{one of the largest in}} the world, controlling assets worth approximately US$56 billion, including over 100 tons of gold reserves in the Central Bank of Libya.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Venezuela and Iran {{took the}} {{earliest}} {{steps in the}} direction <b>of</b> <b>OPEC,</b> by inviting Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to improve communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World WarII. At the time, some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East. The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction. The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; and the world market was dominated {{by a group of}} multinational companies known as the [...] "Seven Sisters", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D. Rockefeller's original Standard Oil monopoly. Oil-exporting countries were eventually motivated to form OPEC as a counterweight to this concentration of political and economic power.|$|E

500|$|The differing {{economic}} needs <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> {{member states}} often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, {{to increase the}} price of oil and thus their own revenues. These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion. [...] Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground. [...] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: [...] "The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones." ...|$|E
500|$|To combat falling {{revenue from}} oil sales, in 1982 Saudi Arabia pressed OPEC for audited {{national}} production quotas {{in an attempt}} to limit output and boost prices. When other OPEC nations failed to comply, Saudi Arabia first slashed its own production from 10million barrels daily in 1979–1981 to just one-third of that level in 1985. When even this proved ineffective, Saudi Arabia reversed course and flooded the market with cheap oil, causing prices to fall below US$10/bbl and higher-cost producers to become unprofitable. Faced with increasing economic hardship (which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989), the [...] "free-riding" [...] oil exporters that had previously failed to comply with OPEC agreements finally began to limit production to shore up prices, based on painstakingly negotiated national quotas that sought to balance oil-related and economic criteria since 1986. (Within their sovereign-controlled territories, the national governments <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> members are able to impose production limits on both government-owned and private oil companies.) Generally when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase.|$|E
500|$|In Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both members <b>of</b> <b>OPEC,</b> no {{official}} warnings had been issued due to Gonu. The storm {{was not expected}} to disrupt oil supplies from these two nations. However, oil prices rose early on June 5 because of concerns of disruptions caused by Gonu, {{as well as the}} threat of nationwide strikes in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer. Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.13, or 1.7percent, to $66.21 Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close in 15 days. Futures reached $66.48, the highest intraday price since April 30. The contract was at $65.95 a barrel, down 26cents, in after-hours electronic trading at [...] Tuesday in Singapore. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said he doubted the increase could be attributed to Gonu. [...] "I don't know if you can really attribute any of the gain to the cyclone," [...] he said. [...] "It's an excuse, as opposed to a reason, for the rise in prices." ...|$|E
500|$|OPEC's stated {{mission is}} [...] "to {{coordinate}} and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, {{in order to}} secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry." [...] The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market. As <b>of</b> May 2017, <b>OPEC's</b> members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (the de facto leader), United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela, while Indonesia is a former member.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Chávez's election, OPEC had {{lost much of its}} {{influence}} compared to when it was first created. [...] A combination <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> members, including Venezuela, regularly ignoring quotas and non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Russia beginning to expand on their own petroleum industries resulted in record low oil prices to which hurt the Venezuelan economy. [...] One of Chávez's main goals as president was to combat this problem by re-strengthening OPEC and getting countries to once again abide by their quotas. [...] Chávez personally visited many of the leaders of oil producing nations around the world, and in 2000, he hosted the first summit of the heads-of-state <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> in 25 years (the second ever). [...] Goals of this meeting, held in Caracas, included recuperating the credibility of Venezuela in OPEC, defending oil prices, consolidating relations between Venezuela and the Arab/Islamic world, and to strengthen OPEC in general.|$|E
2500|$|The Arab {{boycott of}} Israel {{escalated}} with the 1973 oil crisis, when {{the members of}} the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, consisting of the Arab members <b>of</b> <b>OPEC</b> plus Egypt and Syria) announced an oil embargo in October 1973, following United States supply of arms to Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the first time the United States directly supported Israel in a war. The OAPEC embargo targeted Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. OAPEC threatened to cut oil production 5% monthly [...] "until the Israeli forces are completely evacuated from all the Arab territories occupied in the June 1967 war...."
