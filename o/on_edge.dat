5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

5|$|On the November 29 {{episode of}} Raw, both Edge and Benoit competed {{in a number}} one contender's battle royal, but they {{eliminated}} each other simultaneously {{at the conclusion of}} the match, resulting in a draw. As a result, Triple H was forced to defend the title in a triple threat match. In the match, Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface <b>on</b> <b>Edge,</b> who shifted his weight putting Benoit's shoulders on the mat for a pin. This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge, as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge. As a result, the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on Raw. In January 2005, Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Shawn Michaels (acting as special guest referee) performed a superkick <b>on</b> <b>Edge,</b> in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge, causing Edge to be the first eliminated. This led to a match at the Royal Rumble later in the month, in which Edge defeated Michaels.|$|E

Pirates were frequently seen off Ascension, keeping the garrison <b>on</b> <b>edge.</b> Nicolls was also busied by many infrastructure projects on the island, building roads, water tanks, a storehouse, and developing the gardens on Green Mountain. For these efforts, Nicolls had about sixty freed Africans sent to Ascension, and additionally asked for convicts.|$|E

5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody <b>on</b> <b>Edge</b> inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle <b>on</b> <b>Edge,</b> which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|At King of the Ring, The Hardyz {{defeated}} Edge and Christian to {{earn the}} #1 contendership for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On July 5, they defeated The APA to win their first Tag Team Championship. They soon dumped Hayes and briefly picked up Gangrel as a manager, after Gangrel turned <b>on</b> <b>Edge</b> and Christian. At No Mercy, The Hardyz defeated Edge and Christian in the first ever tag team ladder match. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, The Hardyz defeated The Dudley Boyz in the first ever tag team tables match. They competed against The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania 2000 in the first ever Triangle Ladder match, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E

Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army {{was on its way to}} Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.|$|E

Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT <b>on</b> <b>Edge.</b> While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure his arm, and went outside the ring {{in an attempt to}} recover. Edge followed him, trying to perform the spear, but Orton was able to avoid it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{corrosion}} protection <b>on</b> <b>edges</b> of steel constructions -Results of laboratory investigations (Part 2). Based on laboratory tests, the corrosion protection capability of organic coating systems <b>on</b> <b>edges</b> of steel constructions was investigated. The edges were rounded with different mechanical and thermal tools. Three different coating systems were considered, whereby {{one of the}} systems was a so-called edge retentive system. Three criteria were utilized {{in order to assess}} the corrosion protection capability: edge coverage degree, barrier resistance of the coating systems, and an anticorrosive effect. The tests included DFT measurements <b>on</b> <b>edges</b> and areas, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and accelerated ageing tests in a wave tank simulation chamber. Part 1 of the paper covered the general experimental design and details of the experimental procedure, whereas the present Part 2 reports about results of the test programme...|$|R

5|$|As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) {{defeated}} Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, {{they were}} {{given the opportunity to}} be in charge of Raw for a month; On the November 29 episode of Raw, Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface <b>on</b> <b>Edge,</b> only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit’s shoulders to touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee for the Elimination Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{then lost}} a return match {{on a special}} Thursday episode of Raw held in February and blamed special guest referee Mick Foley for his loss, {{claiming}} biased officiating and attacked him. At Saturday Night's Main Event, Foley got revenge <b>on</b> <b>Edge</b> by assaulting him with a con-chair-to. They feuded until WrestleMania 22 in April, where Edge defeated Foley in a Hardcore match by spearing him through a flaming table but suffered second degree burns. Following his feud with Foley, Edge once again challenged John Cena for the WWE Championship. Triple H {{was involved in a}} feud with Cena at the time, resulting in a triple threat match at Backlash, where Cena pinned Triple H to retain the title. After Backlash, Edge continued his feud with Mick Foley as they entered a triple threat hardcore match. Foley, however, betrayed his friend Tommy Dreamer with Edge's assistance. Edge and Foley then proclaimed that, because of their brutal match at WrestleMania, they were the true Hardcore Champions. At June's pay-per-view event One Night Stand, Edge, Foley and Lita defeated Dreamer, Terry Funk and Beulah McGillicutty in an Extreme Rules tag team match. Later in the event, Edge interfered in the WWE Championship match between John Cena and challenger Rob Van Dam, helping Van Dam win the title after he speared Cena through a table.|$|E
