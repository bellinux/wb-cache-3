40|$|Abstract Background The {{implementation}} of the European Working Time Directive has meant the introduction of shift patterns of working for junior doctors. Patient handover between shifts has become {{a necessary part of}} practice {{in order to reduce the}} risk of medical errors. Data handed over between shifts are used to prioritise clinical <b>jobs</b> <b>outstanding,</b> and to create theatre lists. We present a closed-loop audit of handover practice to assess whether standardised proformas improve clinical data transfer between shifts during handover in our Orthopaedic Unit. Methods We collected data handed over between shifts for a period of one week at our department. The data were in the form of hand written data on plain paper used to assist verbal handover. Data were analysed and a standardised handover sheet was trialled. After feedback from juniors the sheet was revised and implemented. A re-audit, of handover data, was then undertaken using the revised standardised proforma during a period of 1 week. Results Forty-eight patients were handed over in week 1 while 55 patients were handed over during re-audit. The standardised proformas encouraged use of pre-printed patient labels which contained legible patient identifiers, use of labels increased from 72. 9 % to 93. 4 %. Handover of <b>outstanding</b> <b>jobs</b> increased from 31. 25 % to 100 %. Overall data handed over increased from 72. 6 % to 93. 2 %. Handover of relevant blood results showed little improvement from 18. 8 % to 20. 7 % Conclusion This audit highlights the issue of data transfer between shifts. Standardised proformas encourage filling of relevant fields and increases the data transferred between shifts thereby reducing the potential for clinical error cause by shift patterns. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a general scheduling {{problem that we}} term the Packing Scheduling problem (PSP). In this problem, jobs can have different arrival times and sizes; a scheduler can process job j at rate xj, subject to arbitrary packing constraints over the set of rates (x) of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>jobs.</b> The PSP framework captures a variety of scheduling problems, including the classical problems of unrelated machines scheduling, broadcast scheduling, and scheduling jobs of different parallelizability. It also cap-tures scheduling constraints arising in diverse modern environments ranging from individual computer architectures to data centers. More concretely, PSP models multidimensional resource requirements and parallelizability, as well as network bandwidth requirements found in data center scheduling. In this paper, we design non-clairvoyant online algorithms for PSP and its special cases – in this setting, the scheduler is unaware of the sizes of jobs. Our results are summarized as follows. • For minimizing total weighted completion time, we show a O(1) -competitive algorithm. Surpris-ingly, we achieve this result by applying the well-known Proportional Fairness algorithm (PF) to perform allocations each time instant. Though PF has been extensively studied {{in the context of}} maximizing fairness in resource allocation, we present the first analysis in adversarial and gen...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a higher}} {{incidence}} of mortality and adverse events among inpatients in UK hospitals at the weekend compared to weekdays. The high volume of routine tasks handed over by the weekday doctors on Fridays may be a contributing factor. An audit was carried out on four acute wards on a Friday evening at University Hospital Lewisham (UHL). It demonstrated that most patients had at least one outstanding task that would need completing by the on-call team over the weekend. To address this problem a concise and memorable checklist was created to ensure that routine jobs are completed by the weekday team prior to the weekend. The checklist uses the acronym “F. R. I. D. A. Y. S. ” to prompt doctors to hand over weekend bloods, ensure drug charts are reviewed, document a plan for IV fluids, complete discharge summaries, monitor antibiotic levels, dose warfarin, and clearly document the ceiling of care. The F. R. I. D. A. Y. S. checklist was printed onto history paper and integrated into the patient notes on a Friday ward round. The efficacy of the checklist was evaluated by reviewing the number of <b>outstanding</b> <b>jobs</b> on the wards after 17 : 00 on a Friday in the categories listed.

40|$|Maintaining the {{freshness}} of real-time data {{is one of the}} crucial design issues in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Past studies have focused on designing update algorithms to minimize the workload imposed by a fixed set of update tasks while ensuring the temporal validity of data. In this paper, we revisit this problem in dynamic cyber-physical systems (DCPS) which may exhibit multi-modal behavior. Any solution to this problem must recognize that: (1) different update algorithms may be needed in different modes according to the workload in each mode, and (2) temporal validity of data must be maintained not only in each mode but also during the mode switch. To strike a balance between data freshness and system schedulability, we propose a utilization-based scheduling selection (UBSS) strategy. We first introduce two synchronous mode switch algorithms, named search-based switch (SBS) and adjustment-based switch (ABS) to search for the proper switch point online and execute all update tasks in the new mode synchronously. SBS checks for temporal validity at the beginning time slot of each idle period in the schedule, while ABS relaxes this restriction through schedule adjustment. To support immediate mode switch, we propose an asynchronous switch algorithm named instant switch (IS) to reduce the switch delay. IS schedules <b>outstanding</b> <b>jobs</b> from the old mode together with the jobs in the new mode using the least-available-laxity-first scheduling policy. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these three algorithms. They also show that UBSS strategy can significantly outperform a single fixed update algorithm in terms of maintaining better data freshness while incurring only limited online switch overhead...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the inventory management problem of procurement and allocation for a non-stationary equipment overhaul problem with stochastic demands for multiple job types requiring {{different combinations of}} service parts over a finite horizon. Because the service parts involved tend to be expensive, inventory needs to be managed carefully in order to operate in a cost-effective manner. This problem is complex because the procurement lead times tend to be long. We incorporate into our model holding costs for unused service parts and backordering costs for <b>outstanding</b> <b>jobs.</b> Using linear programs to approximate the value function which appears in the dynamic programming formulation, we derive a non-standard allocation procedure which is neither first-come-firstserved nor myopic. To obtain procurement decisions, we decompose the original problem into multiple single-part-multi-job-type sub-problems using dual variables. These sub-problems may be tackled by another layer of decomposition using the classical result of Clark and Scarf (1960). Using independent order-up-to procurement and myopic allocation as the bench mark, our policy performs better for the canonical "N" system with two service parts and two job types and also for larger problems. In {{the second part of}} this dissertation, we focus on a single-part-single-jobtype problem where backorders accumulate increasing per-period backlogging charges. We show that the state space may still be collapsed into the single- dimensional inventory position using a non-traditional dynamic program formulation where the immediate cost function consists of all the expected holding and backordering charges associated with the procured units. We use stoppingtime random variables to capture the periods in which the procured units are matched up with customer requests. Using this alternate cost accounting mechanism, we independently show the optimality of base-stock policies, a result also obtained by Huh et al. (2011) using a more traditional approach. This dynamic program is suitable for computation and it allows us to compute the optimal base-stock levels. Finally, we extend these results to two-echelon inventory distribution systems with aging backorders. Because the first-come-first-served allocation of inventory is not necessarily optimal in a distribution network, we modify our cost-accounting mechanism {{at the level of the}} upper echelon and derive a dynamic program which is a lower bound for the exact problem. This lowerbound dynamic program has the advantage of using a state vector that does not need to distinguish among backorders of different ages. We decompose this lower-bound dynamic program using Clark and Scarf's (1960) approach to derive yet another lower bound consisting only of single-location problems with single-dimensional state variables. A numerical study is carried out to see how the performance of an operating policy driven by this decomposition compares with the lower bound obtained...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The study {{investigated}} the impact of operational work system design on staff performance in selected construction firms in Nigeria. Research Design & Methods: The study used primary data gathered {{with the use of}} a  5 -point Likert scale questionnaire format administered to 138 respondents. A hypothesis was postulated to test the significance of the research problem. Data analysis was carried out using correlation and multiple regression analysis which proved the significance of the alternative hypothesis as a result of testing the hypothesis. Findings: The findings show that there is a significant relationship between operational work system design and staff performance. The study concludes that operational job design can be advanced as a motivation tool, which is non-monetary in nature, to improve staff performance. Implications & Recommendations: A key drive to improve performance is the satisfaction of staff coupled with an <b>outstanding</b> operational <b>job</b> design which takes into consideration the total physical and mental well-being of staff and its interaction with other organisational factors.
