50|$|Ion {{thrusters}} are an {{enabling technology}} for SSP Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Orbit (GEO) <b>orbit</b> <b>transfer</b> and station keeping. Studies showed that advanced electric propulsion {{can provide a}} factor of 5 increase in payload for Earth to <b>orbit</b> <b>transfer</b> when compared to storable biprop and cryogenic biprop thrusters; payload mass that normally would be manifested for propellant. Comparisons made to gridded ion thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic and pulsed inductive thrusters showed that Hall thruster technology provides overall greater benefits, including quicker trip times, good power density, a good contemporary technology base and good flight history, all translating into commercial industry acceptance. Advances such as direct power drive from the solar arrays and single and/or two-stage operation will allow payloads of 13 to 15 metric tons per 20 metric tons to LEO from launch as opposed to only 2 metric tons using chemical propulsion. Trip times from LEO to GEO are also reasonable at 120 to 230 days depending on performance setpoint. The proposed Hall thruster system consisted of four 50 kW krypton Hall thrusters directly driven from a 200 kW solar array. The propulsion system will be included on each SSP segment. Performance required from the Hall thruster units is 2000 to 3500 sec ISP with an overall system efficiency of 52% to 57%. Due to the mass of fuel required to place the entire system into geostationary orbit, propellants besides xenon (normally used), such as krypton and noble gas mixtures were proposed. Additional work on alternative fuels would eventually need to be conducted.|$|E

Using stored energy {{makes it possible}} to thrust through eclipses, but requires that some of the solar power collected during the sunlit portion of the trajectory be used to recharge the storage system. Previous researchers have reported that the required energy storage mass can be prohibitive. However, the use of high-speed flywheels for energy storage can provide advantages. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of <b>orbit</b> <b>transfers</b> using and without using energy storage. The <b>orbit</b> <b>transfers</b> are developed as sequences of time-optimal circle-to-circle planar <b>transfers</b> from low-Earth <b>orbit</b> to geostationary orbit.

Yet, the design of low-thrust trajectories is complex and challenging. Third-body perturbations often dominate the thrust, and a significant change to the orbit requires a long duration of thrust. In order to guide the early design phases, we have developed an efficient and efficacious method to obtain approximate propellant and flight-time requirements (i. e., the Pareto front) for <b>orbit</b> <b>transfers.</b> A search for the Pareto-optimal trajectories is done in two levels: optimal thrust angles and locations are determined by Q-law, while the Q-law is optimized with two evolutionary algorithms: a genetic algorithm and a simulated-annealing-related algorithm.

On 5 March 2010, Hayabusa was on a trajectory that would have passed within the lunar orbit. Ion engine operation was suspended to measure the precise trajectory in preparation to perform Trajectory Correction Maneuver 1 to the Earth-rim trajectory.

Over the weekend of June 17-18, 2017, engineers on the ground remotely operated the International Space Station’s robotic Canadarm2 to extract the Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) experiment from the SpaceX Dragon resupply ship. After the observation the mechanism was not planned to be retrieved back to earth.The solar array unfurled June 18, extending like a party favor with tensioning booms {{on both sides of}} the 5.5-foot-wide (1.6-meter-wide) wing. NASA decided to conduct continuous tests for a week and observe its consequences [...]Engineers observed the behavior of the solar array as the space station sailed through day and night during each 90-minute orbit of Earth, exposing it to extreme temperature swings. A mechanical actuator also introduced vibrations and oscillations to gauge the array’s response to structural loads, and engineers measured the power production from solar cells attached to the panel. The experiments went well, but ground controllers were unable to lock the solar panel back in its stowed configuration after rolling it up. Anyhow the solar array was successfully jettisoned from the International Space Station. Mission managers planned to roll up the panel and return it to the Dragon spacecraft’s external payload bay, which would burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. Certainly, the Air Force is interested from a LEO to GEO (low Earth orbit to geostationary <b>orbit)</b> <b>transfer</b> perspective.

Many missions desire minimal mass to reduce the mission cost, which may be achieved in part by choosing the appropriate propulsion system. Some military missions and manned missions, however, may prefer minimal <b>orbit</b> <b>transfer</b> time over minimal cost associated with minimal mass. In many missions, the choices for the <b>orbit</b> <b>transfer</b> and propulsion system may be obvious.
