5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland, who was intrigued by the story because {{he had not seen}} many television episodes about vegetarianism. The designs for Paul and Linda McCartney are unusual for The Simpsons in that the characters have brown and blue irises, respectively. Most The Simpsons characters simply have black spots in the centers <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E

25|$|Waterhorse: A large pinniped, {{similar to}} the long necked and merhorse. Only the males are maned, but females appear to have snorkels. Both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are rather small. They are {{noteworthy}} for being behind both salt and fresh water sightings.|$|E
25|$|The {{king was}} so {{infatuated}} with Santhumala that he assented. Under his orders eleven of his wives had both <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> gouged out, but the youngest one {{had only one}} eye removed. Following this the Twelve Sisters were banished to a deep dark cave from {{where there was no}} way out. Then the king instructed his servants not to bring any food and not to help the Twelve Sisters in any way.|$|E
25|$|Possessing {{detailed}} hyperspectral colour vision, the Mantis shrimp {{has been}} reported to have the world's most complex colour vision system. Trilobites, which are now extinct, had unique compound eyes. They used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> In this, they differ from most other arthropods, which have soft eyes. The number of lenses in such an eye varied, however: some trilobites had only one, and some had thousands of lenses in one eye.|$|E

30|$|The {{number of}} dendritiform {{inflammatory}} cells in herpetic anterior uveitis {{was compared to}} that in the Fuchs uveitis syndrome. Of the eyes of patients with herpetic anterior uveitis, 80 % had an average of 98.0 ± 10.8 cells/mm 2 (mean±standard error of the mean (SEM), n= 10) in <b>their</b> affected <b>eyes</b> and 60.4 ± 26.4 cells/mm 2, (n= 6) in 30 % <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fellow <b>eyes.</b> Patients with Fuchs uveitis syndrome had moderately elevated dendritiform inflammatory cells (47.0 ± 9.7 cells/mm 2, n= 14) in 96.4 % <b>of</b> <b>their</b> affected <b>eyes</b> and normal numbers (23.0 ± 7.3 cells/mm 2, n= 13) in 46.4 % <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fellow <b>eyes.</b> The difference between the four groups was significant (p= 0.0004).|$|R
25|$|The Pageant: Kà {{begins with}} the stage set as a ship. The twins are {{returning}} home, and preparations are in motion for their arrival. The boat docks, and the entire royal family is united. The court celebrates {{the return of the}} twins by displaying fantastic feats in a pageant, while the twins each perform together on their flutes. Just as the celebration comes to a close, pandemonium erupts when the court is attacked by a group of archers. The twins watch in horror as their parents, The Emperor and Empress, are assassinated in front <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Advanced players {{improve their}} {{performance}} {{through a number}} of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.|$|E
25|$|Some bird {{groups have}} {{specific}} modifications to their visual system linked to {{their way of}} life. Birds of prey {{have a very high}} density of receptors and other adaptations that maximise visual acuity. The placement <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> gives them good binocular vision enabling accurate judgement of distances. Nocturnal species have tubular eyes, low numbers of colour detectors, but a high density of rod cells which function well in poor light. Terns, gulls and albatrosses are amongst the seabirds which have red or yellow oil droplets in the colour receptors to improve distance vision especially in hazy conditions.|$|E
60|$|Now, if the {{accident}} had {{happened at the}} rectory gates, and old Helstone had taken in the martyr, neither Yorke nor his wife would have pitied him. They would have adjudged him right served for his tyranny and meddling. As it was, he became, for the present, the apple <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
25|$|These {{fish are}} named because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> barrel-shaped, tubular <b>eyes,</b> which are {{generally}} directed upwards {{to detect the}} silhouettes of available prey; however, according to Robison and Reisenbichler, these fish are capable <b>of</b> directing <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> forward, as well. The family name Opisthoproctidae {{is derived from the}} Greek words opisthe ("behind") and proktos ("anus").|$|R
30|$|Twenty-eight male, native Japanese-speaking college {{students}} were recruited as participants 10. Data collected from {{four of the}} participants was removed from analysis either because of experimental error (the participants misunderstood the task) or due to data recording error (50 % <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> movement data was lost). Thus, {{the study was conducted}} using data collected from 24 participants 11.|$|R
25|$|The {{reason that}} cats {{are seen as}} yōkai in Japanese mythology is {{attributed}} {{to many of the}} characteristics that they possess: for example, the way the irises <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> change shape depending on the time of day, the way their fur seems to cause sparks due to static electricity when they are petted (especially in winter), the way they sometimes lick blood, the way they can walk without making a sound, their wild nature that remains despite the gentleness they can show at times, the way they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), the sharpness of their claws and teeth, their nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.|$|E
25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E
25|$|Belugas {{are able}} to see within and outside of water, but their vision is {{relatively}} poor when compared to dolphins. Their eyes are especially adapted to seeing under water, although when they {{come into contact with}} the air, the crystalline lens and the cornea adjust to overcome the associated myopia (the range of vision under water is short). A beluga's retina has cones and rods, which also suggests they can see in low light. The presence of cone cells indicates they can see colours, although this suggestion has not been confirmed. Glands located in the medial corner <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> secrete an oily, gelatinous substance that lubricates the eye and helps flush out foreign bodies. This substance forms a film that protects the cornea and the conjunctiva from pathogenic organisms.|$|E

The State of Israel is the apple <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> in good times, and especially in bad." ...|$|R
5000|$|The sky {{bridge between}} Cathays Park 1 and 2 'the link' {{has been the}} subject of some {{discussion}} amongst staff based in the building. People have reported an eerie feeling, a general sense of something [...] "unworldly" [...] with people catching fleeting glimpses out of the corner <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> which had led to rumours of the area being haunted.|$|R
25|$|In 1880 an {{expedition}} {{sponsored by the}} Peabody Museum at an archaeological dig in Cross County, Arkansas found the first reported example. Approximately 200 whole and fragmentary head pots are in private and public collections. Each is unique and it is thought because of the shapes <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and half opened mouths that they are representations of deceased individuals, a death mask of sorts, although it is unclear if they {{are meant to be}} the trophy heads of enemies or of their own honored dead. The pots often have painted surfaces, engraved lines representing tattooing and in some cases holes representing ear and nose piercing. Several fine examples are on display at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington D.C., the Hampson Museum State Park in Wilson, Arkansas, the Parkin Archeological State Park in Parkin, Arkansas and in the University of Arkansas Museum in Fayetteville, Arkansas.|$|E
500|$|The {{three girls}} all have oval-shaped heads, {{abnormally}} large eyes (inspired by Margaret Keane's art), stubby arms and legs, and lack noses, ears, fingers, necks, and flat feet with toes (McCracken preferred {{them to look}} more symbolic of actual girls rather than going for a [...] "realistic" [...] look, meaning fewer body parts were needed). Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup wear dresses that match the colors <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> with black belts, as well as white tights and black Mary Janes. The closing theme to the cartoon offers a nutshell description of the two Powerpuff Girls' personalities: Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.|$|E
500|$|Myrmecia ants {{are easily}} noticeable, {{due to their}} large mandibles, and large {{compound}} eyes that provide excellent vision, and a powerful sting that they use to kill prey. Each <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> contains 3,000 facets, making them the second largest in the ant world. Size varies widely, ranging from [...] in length. The largest Myrmecia species is M. brevinoda, with workers measuring M. brevinoda workers are also {{the largest in the}} world. Almost all species are monomorphic, but M. brevinoda is the only known species where polymorphism exists. It is well known that two worker subcastes exist, but this does not distinguish them as two different polymorphic forms. This {{may be due to the}} lack of food during winter and they could be incipient colonies. The division of labour is based on the size of ant, rather than its age, with the larger workers foraging for food or keeping guard outside the nest, while the smaller workers tend to the brood.|$|E

2500|$|Several of Hurston's {{literary}} contemporaries criticized Hurston's use of dialect as {{a caricature}} of African-American culture rooted in a racist tradition. In particular, a number of writers associated with the Harlem Renaissance were critical of Hurston's later writings, {{on the basis that}} they did not agree with or further the position of the overall movement.

2500|$|Due to the creatures' being {{described}} {{in only a}} few sentences in the novella, Darabont sought to conceive of new designs. The challenge was creating designs that felt unique. Nicotero, who was versed in film history and genre history, reviewed past creature designs to avoid having similar designs. When the designs were completed, Nicotero and Burrell educated the cast on the appearance of the creatures by showing puppets and the function <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouths. [...] The puppet demonstrations served as reference points for the cast, who had to respond to motion capture dots during filming.|$|E
5000|$|The {{predicted}} {{impact point}} (PIP) is the location that a ballistic projectile (e.g. bomb, missile, bullet) {{is expected to}} strike if fired. The PIP is almost always actively determined by a targeting computer, which then projects a PIP marker (a [...] "pipper") onto a Head-Up Display (HUD). Modern HUDs are focused so the weapon operator will see the marker projected directly over the point of impact, regardless of the position <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|R
