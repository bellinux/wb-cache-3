Although the tracks do not feature serious ascents or descents, the narrow tracks, high speeds and curvy layout through tree plantations make it a popular and rather distinctive riding area.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{essential}} functions of a company is to generate new ideas that incorporate customer wants and needs while maintaining a competitive advantage over their competitors. <b>Oneway</b> companies can establish or maintain a competitive advantage is by increasing the added value of their products for the consumers by means of environmental improvements in their products and services. As important as idea finding in an environmental sense can be for a company, {{it can also be}} a barrier to developing sustainable services. The idea generation phase can be more complex when innovating at function or system level, because the ideas need to be found on a higher level of abstraction, meaning not ‘design an artefact for transportation’ rather ‘design a new mobility concept’. One important consideration companies should have is that products as well as services should be regarded as possible part of the solution, and that environmental gain could be the starting point for idea generation. This can be done using tools such as Blueprinting, Adapted MET-matrix, Adapted LiDS-wheel, Green options generation, Benchmarking and eco-costs or the value approach. The development of different elements of the solutions to sustainable services should be planned in advance, which can be another barrier for companies. The most important tool companies can use to overcome this is by utilizing project management tools to establish a course of actions and ideas for the future (Brezet et al. 2001).|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the correlation between}} the bone mineral density (BMD) and spinal mobility and chest expansion index in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Eighty patients with confirmed diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis were included in this study. In all of them physical examination was performed including assessment of spinal mobility and chest expansion index. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L 1 -L 4, anteroposterior view) and at the left hip was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in standard manner According to the WHO classification of osteoporosis, patients were classified in three groups (normal, osteopenic or osteoporotic) depending on the osteoporotic status in lumbar spine, hip and femoral neck region. Eighty patients (46 men and 34 women; age 25 - 73 years) were included. Mean BMD for lumbar spine was 1. 104 +/- 1. 043 (T score: 0. 67 +/- 2. 15) and for total hip was 1. 057 +/- 0. 899 (T score: - 0. 28 +/- 2. 34). Significant difference in the mobility of thoracic spine was observed in patients in regard to the WHO classification of osteoporosis in lumbar and femoral region (p = 0. 031, <b>Oneway</b> Anova for osteoporosis of lumbar region; p = 0. 022, <b>Oneway</b> Anova for osteoporosis of total hip region).

Previous research showed that black tea was able to prevent the formation of atherosclerosis. This research aim to complete the previous research by observing the effect of administration of black tea to SGOT and SGPT in balb/c mice. Method: This research used laboratory experimental method with post test-only control group design. Research sample were 15 balb/c mice that were divided into 3 groups randomly, each were given black tea with dose of 25, 4 mg, 50, 8 mg, and 101, 6 mg each. Treatment was given for 30 days, then blood sampling and termination was carried out, afterwards the blood samples were examined. Data distribution was tested using Saphiro-Wilk, if data distribution is normal using <b>oneway</b> ANOVA test. Result: Mean SGOT on each group were P 1 = 22, 5, P 2 = 21, 9, and P 3 = 37, 9, then it were tested with <b>oneway</b> ANOVA test and the result was p= 0. 156 which mean that {{there was no significant difference}} among the groups.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, Bellare and Palacio {{succeeded in}} {{defining}} the plaintext awareness, which is also called PA 2, in the standard model. They propose three valiants of the standard model PA 2 named perfect, statistical, and computational PA 2. In this paper, we study {{the relationship between the}} standard model PA 2 and the property about message hiding, that is, IND-CPA. Although it seems that these two are independent notions at first glance, we show that all of the perfect, statistical, and computational PA 2 in the standard model imply the IND-CPA security if the encryption function is <b>oneway.</b> By using this result, we also showed that “PA 2 + <b>Oneway</b> ⇒ IND-CCA 2 ”. This result shows the “all-or-nothing” aspect of the PA 2. That is, a standard model PA 2 secure public-key encryption scheme either satisfies the strongest message hiding property, IND-CCA 2, or does not satisfy even the weakest message hiding property, onewayness. We also showed that the computational PA 2 notion is strictly stronger than the statistical one...|$|E
