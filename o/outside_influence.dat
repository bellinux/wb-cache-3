5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, {{there are}} records of Didsbury {{existing}} as a small hamlet {{as early as the}} 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate that covered a large part of what is now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from <b>outside</b> <b>influence.</b> In 1745 Charles Edward Stuart crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in the subsequent retreat.|$|E

Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that <b>outside</b> <b>influence</b> played {{no role in the}} decision. In 2008, he was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any <b>outside</b> <b>influence.</b> Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to discover what <b>outside</b> <b>influences</b> cause eating disorders among college-age women. Eating disorders such as overeating, anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating have been affecting college-aged women for years. There are a handful of college-age women that have eating disorders factored by the <b>outside</b> <b>influences</b> in their lives. For this study, we looked at <b>outside</b> <b>influences</b> such as peers, relationships, media, and school stress that affect some of the women on campus. To complete this research, we conducted a survey and examined the results we gathered from college-age women from Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana. The surveys were distributed in residence halls on campus and returned in a closed envelope to ensure confidentiality. Women answered questions about their age eating habits, the media they view, the influence of their peers, their fitness level, and the amount of stress from school. A correlation between the scores determined what <b>outside</b> <b>influences</b> affect college-age women who have eating disorders. This experiment helped give us a better idea of what triggers eating disorders for college-age women...|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of <b>outside</b> <b>influence</b> could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|Inland batik or batik kraton (Javanese court batik) is {{the oldest}} form of batik {{tradition}} known in Java. Inland batik has earthy colour such as black, indigo, brown, and sogan (brown-yellow colour made from the tree Peltophorum pterocarpum), sometimes against a white background, with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from <b>outside</b> <b>influence.</b> Certain patterns are reserved for royalty, while other are worn on specific occasions. At a Javanese wedding for example, the bride wears specific patterns at each stage of the ceremony. Noted inland batiks are produced in Solo and Jogjakarta, cities traditionally regarded as the centre of Javanese culture. Batik Solo typically has sogan background and is preserved by the Susuhunan and Mangkunegaran Court. Batik Jogja typically has white background and is preserved by the Yogyakarta Sultanate and Pakualaman Court.|$|E
5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue <b>outside</b> <b>influence,</b> but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, <b>outside</b> <b>influence,</b> particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 105 p. Previous psychometric research was done to create the EADES (Eating and Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress) Questionnaire, which is a questionnaire consisting of 54 questions that measures aspects of how individuals cope with stress and emotions using food. From this preliminary research, the EADES Model was created, which includes: Factor 1 : Emotion- and Stress-Related Eating, Factor 2 : Appraisal of Ability and Resources to Cope, and Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors. However, due to the poor internal consistency of Factor 3, further study was needed to determine its utility in the EADES Model and its ability to help identify individuals who are or are at risk of becoming overweight and obese. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine the utility of Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors in the EADES (Eating and Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress) Questionnaire and to determine if the factor should continue to be used in the EADES Model and questionnaire. Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors assesses eating that may be evoked in response to stressors and may serve as a type of coping mechanism or as a behavioral or psychological measure to manage stress. Ultimately, it identifies the level of personal perceived stress from external influences. The current study is a secondary data analysis using data from previous research done with the preliminary validation of the EADES Questionnaire. The convenience sample in the preliminary cross-sectional study included faculty and staff from a southeastern university. Through factor analysis, internal consistency (reliability) of scales, the EADES Questionnaire proved to have a strong Cronbach alpha of. 95. However, of the three factors, Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors was the weakest, resulting in a Cronbach alpha of. 65. Additionally, the preliminary EADES study produced two models that helped to explain the relationship between emotional eating, coping efforts and overweight status. However, Factor 3 did not remain in these models. Thus, secondary analysis was used to help determine its utility within the EADES Model and to determine its potential for helping to predict overweight and obesity. Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rho were used in this study to determine if there was a significant correlation between Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors, Factor 1 : Emotion- and Stress-Related Eating, and Factor 2 : Appraisal of Ability and Resources to Cope. Chi-square, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann Whitney tests for goodness of fit were used to identify if there was a significant association between Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors and weight status as measured by body mass index (BMI). ANOVA test further verified that there was a significant difference between Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors and BMI categories, specifically normal weight versus overweight/obese. Results of this secondary data analysis of Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors indicated that question items in Factor 3 are not functioning well together with Factor 1 : Emotion- and Stress-Related Eating and Factor 2 : Appraisal of Ability and Resources to Cope to provide solid internal consistency. Current Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors question items need to be deleted and new question items need to be added. Further analysis of Factor 3 : Appraisal of <b>Outside</b> <b>Influences</b> and Stressors is warranted if it is to be used in helping to predict overweight and obesity. Ultimately, current question items in Factor 3 could potentially be deleted from the EADES Model, as it was not showing a significant correlation with other factors or association (p< 0. 05) with weight status as measured by BMI...|$|R
