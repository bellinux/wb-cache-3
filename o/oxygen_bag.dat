"These {{were the}} {{thoughts}} {{in my head}} as I climbed that monstrous inclined plane with the wind sometimes beating {{in my face and}} sometimes whistling behind my ears, while the cloud-land beneath me fell away to such a distance that the folds and hummocks of silver had all smoothed out into one flat, shining plain. But suddenly I had a horrible and unprecedented experience. I have known before {{what it is to be}} in what our neighbours have called a tourbillon, but never on such a scale as this. That huge, sweeping river of wind of which I have spoken had, as it appears, whirlpools within it which were as monstrous as itself. Without a moment's warning I was dragged suddenly into the heart of one. I spun round for a minute or two with such velocity that I almost lost my senses, and then fell suddenly, left wing foremost, down the vacuum funnel in the centre. I dropped like a stone, and lost nearly a thousand feet. It was only my belt that kept me in my seat, and the shock and breathlessness left me hanging half-insensible over the side of the fuselage. But I am always capable of a supreme effort--it is my one great merit as an aviator. I was conscious that the descent was slower. The whirlpool was a cone rather than a funnel, and I had come to the apex. With a terrific wrench, throwing my weight all to one side, I levelled my planes and brought her head away from the wind. In an instant I had shot out of the eddies and was skimming down the sky. Then, shaken but victorious, I turned her nose up and began once more my steady grind on the upward spiral. I took a large sweep to avoid the danger- spot of the whirlpool, and soon I was safely above it. Just after one o'clock I was twenty-one thousand feet above the sea-level. To my great joy I had topped the gale, and with every hundred feet of ascent the air grew stiller. On the other hand, it was very cold, and I was conscious of that peculiar nausea which goes with rarefaction of the air. For the first time I unscrewed the mouth of my <b>oxygen</b> <b>bag</b> and took an occasional whiff of the glorious gas. I could feel it running like a cordial through my veins, and I was exhilarated almost to the point of drunkenness. I shouted and sang as I soared upwards into the cold, still outer world.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Numerous studies have addressed the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce numbers of bacteria on beef carcass surfaces. These treatments have included hot water, organic acids, and other sanitizers, and have been highly effective in reducing pathogens and spoilage organisms. Although these treatments are beneficial, unusual spoilage patterns due to the treatments have been claimed by members of the beef industry, including suggestions that meat becomes too clean with these treatments, and that pathogens might be able to grow faster {{due to a lack of}} competition secondary to reductions in the numbers and types of microflora. This study focused on reproducing conditions in ground beef production that may lead to unusual spoilage patterns or pathogen growth. In order to detect potential differences in spoilage patterns due to carcass decontamination treatments, bacteria were isolated and identified from packages of ground beef that were obtained from the treated carcasses. Additional studies were performed using beef inoculated with pathogens which included E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella serotype Typhimurium. The treatments consisted of the application of one of three sanitizers to the carcass surface: hot water, lactic acid, or acetic acid. Ground beef was obtained from the treated carcass, packaged under a vacuum in high <b>oxygen</b> barrier <b>bags,</b> and stored at 10 ?C and 4 ?C, and then sampled for numbers of bacteria every seven days for seven weeks. Results from the present study indicate that antimicrobial treatments applied to carcasses are not likely to affect spoilage patterns in ground beef. Unusual spoilage patterns resembling those in industrial settings were only observed when packages were stored at elevated refrigeration temperatures (10 ?C). In addition, no treatment caused an excessive outgrowth of pathogens. Bacterial type distributions were similar for all treatments, indicating no selection of bacteria due to particular treatments. Based upon the data collected in this study, it is most likely that the unusual spoilage patterns reported in the industry are caused by storage in upper ranges of refrigeration temperatures, and not by changes in the microflora of the meat...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relative contribution of the muscle and ventilatory pumps to stroke volume in patients without a subpulmonic ventricle. BackgroundIn patients with Fontan circulation, it is unclear how venous return is augmented to increase stroke volume and cardiac output during exercise. MethodsCardiac output (acetylene rebreathing), heart rate (electrocardiography), <b>oxygen</b> uptake (Douglas <b>bag</b> technique), and ventilation were measured in 9 patients age 15. 8 ± 6 years at 6. 1 ± 1. 8 years after Fontan operation and 8 matched controls. Data were obtained at rest, after 3 min of steady-state exercise (Ex) on a cycle ergometer at 50 % of individual working capacity, during unloaded cycling at 0 W (muscle pump alone), during unloaded cycling with isocapnic hyperpnea (muscle and ventilatory pump), during Ex plus an inspiratory load of 12. 8 ± 1. 5 cm water, and during Ex plus an expiratory load of 12. 8 ± 1. 6 cm water. ResultsIn Fontan patients, the largest increases in stroke volume and stroke volume index were during zero-resistance cycling. An additional increase with submaximal exercise occurred in controls only. During Ex plus expiratory load, stroke volume indexes were reduced to baseline, non-exercise levels in Fontan patients, without significant changes in controls. ConclusionsWith Fontan circulation increases in cardiac output and stroke volume during Ex were due to the muscle pump, with a small additional contribution by the ventilatory pump. An increase in intrathoracic pressure played a deleterious role in Fontan circulation by decreasing systemic venous return and stroke volume...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPostharvest {{insect pests}} {{threaten}} the nutritional and financial security of smallholder {{farmers in the}} developing world. Hermetic storage, a technology that protects grain against insects by blocking their supply of oxygen, alleviates the problem of insect-caused losses. PICS (Purdue Improved Crop Storage) bags represent one hermetic technology that improves food availability and incomes of farmers. The polyethylene liners of PICS bags are sometime damaged during use, acquiring small holes or tears. Observations in the laboratory and field suggest that insect development remains localized around {{the point where the}} bag is damaged. We hypothesized that the grain within a hermetic container that has minimal localized damage (such as an insect hole), helps retard leakage of <b>oxygen</b> into the <b>bag</b> and contributes to limiting insect damage and to the overall protective effect. To test this hypothesis, we filled 4  cm dia. by 10  cm long PVC pipes with Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) infested cowpeas and sealed them with caps having a single, insect-sized hole in its center. A vertical tube positioned above the cowpea-filled PVC pipe was filled with one of three different grains (sesame, sorghum, and maize) to different depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 50  cm). Seed size and grain barrier depth significantly reduced the level of bruchid damage to the stored cowpea in the PVC container. Smaller sized grains used for the barriers retarded insect development more effectively than larger sized grains, while deeper grain depth was more effective than shallower barriers. The grain held in a hermetic container contributes in a small, but significant, way to the effectiveness of the containers...|$|R

In this study, we investigated {{the changes in}} biochemical and haematological indices in advanced fingerlings of rohu, Labeo rohita in order to optimize the packing density as is imperative to avoid transportation stress and associated mortality. The fish (14. 00 – 15. 00 cm) were packed in sealed double layer <b>oxygen</b> packed polythene <b>bags</b> of 30 L capacity containing 7. 5 L of water and transported for 2 h and 30 min in a motor vehicle at three packing densities, viz., 67 gL− 1, 134 gL− 1, and 201 gL− 1 and transported from hatchery to Kolkata, India covering {{a distance of about}} 55 km. A cumulative mortality of 30 % was recorded during and after transportation in fish transported at 201 gL− 1; while the other two packing densities recorded no mortalities. Transportation and packing density induced stress affected the functioning of liver and kidney. The activities of transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase, breakdown of protein and creatinine phosphate, cortisol induced glucose production were significantly increased in advanced rohu fingerlings to cope with the energy demand posed by transportation and higher packing density stress. Low levels of dissolved oxygen and high levels of ammonia-nitrogen were noticed in different packing densities after transportation. The results suggested that the optimum packing density for advanced rohu fingerlings for 2 – 3 h duration of transport would be 134 gL− 1, which kept the stress at low levels. The serum alanine aminotransferase levels can serve as a good marker for fish liver health as the increment was more prominent when subjected to transportation stress...|$|R

40|$|The Danish anaesthesiologist Björn Ibsen {{should be}} placed among the pioneers of the {{development}} of long term ventilation by the upper airways (in this publication I have only briefly mentioned his other contributions, in particular the development of Intensive care medicine). Ibsen learned the basics of anaesthesia in the USA (1949 / 50). Returning to Denmark he worked as independent anaesthesiologist. In 1952, together with Mogens Björneboe, he treated newborn child who suffered from Tetanus. The treatment consisted of barbiturates and curare, in an attempt to suppress the muscular cramps of the child. The child was ventilated with manual positive pressure during the treatment. The child died but this attempt of treatment proved to be an important step in the development of long term ventilation by the upper airways. The core of this work is Ibsen’s introduction of the new treatment for treating poliomyelitis patients with respiratory insufficiency. In 1952, a severe poliomyelitis epidemic hit Copenhagen. At the time the normal treatment of poliomyelitis patients with respiratory failure was passive negative pressure ventilation. At the hospital treating the poliomyelitis patients in Copenhagen there were by far not enough respirators to treat all the severely ill patients. As several patients died from respiratory failure the epidemiologist Lassen was lead to try out a new and untested treatment, and contacted Ibsen. Because I have been able to find the records of the patient, it has now been possible to describe exactly what happened on the 27. August 1952, as Ibsen demonstrated his new treatment on a 12 -year old girl. Ibsen intended to ventilate the girl by a tracheotomy, with manual positive pressure from an <b>oxygen</b> filled <b>bag</b> (he had read about his method in an American paper from 1950. here the method was being used as supplement to the negative pressure ventilation from the Iron Lung). Ventilating the patient, however, was only possible after Ibsen had anaesthetised her with barbiturate. The girl survived. As a direct consequence the treatment of the poliomyelitis patients with respiratory problems was changed to follow Ibsen’s directions. Numerous helpers would within days ventilate until 75 patients until they recovered (or died). I do not know for how long the longest ventilation-period was, but I presume it was several weeks. After the epidemic Ibsen found time to develop his method. In 1953 he treated a child with tetanus with anaesthetic drugs and curare, and had it ventilated by a tracheotomy. This positive pressure ventilation by the upper airways of an unconscious patient lasted 17 days. This time the patient survived. It was only later in his life that Ibsen received international recognition for his work (directly after the poliomyelitis epidemic it was Lassen who took the glory). He remained a modest man, something I have been able to verify my self when I interviewed him shortly before his death. He died the 7 th of August 2007...|$|R

These documents were translated into English for this chapter. Research in Chapter 3, “Field trials of Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl. grown in North America; Growth, yield and quality traits,” showed that M. expansa horticultural varieties 2 ̆ 7 L 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 T 2 ̆ 7 are tolerant to the intense weather conditions of southern Illinois, when grown on constructed sand plots. In Chapter 4, “Amino Acid profiles for two horticultural varieties of Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl. : A rare indigenous Andean crop grown in southern Illinois,” M. expansa was examined for its amino acid values and those values considered in terms of differnces between the two varieties and above and below ground structures. In addition, soil amendments peat and steer manure, considered alone and together, as well as structure and variety, were examined for their effect on production of amino acids in ANOVAs and Tukey-adjusted LS-Means run in SAS 9. 3. In Chapter 5, “Nutrients, Comparison of Amino Acid Profiles, and Cytotoxicity Testing for Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz and Pav.) Standl.,” the amino acid profiles for M. expansa from the previous chapter are compared to profiles for other crops, eggs and milk. M. expansa is shown relatively to contain extremely high amounts of total protein. In addition published values for other nutrients for M. expansa taken from translated material are combined into two tables. Also, a cytotoxicity assay carried out in collaboration with researchers at Ohio State University was used to see if the southern Illinois M. expansa material was active against highly sensitive HT- 29 colon cancer cells. Negative results from that assay serves as preliminary data for a lack of toxicity due to micro-molecules in the crop. Chapter 6, “Inexpensive nitrogen chambers for conservation of herbarium specimens,” was an outgrowth of the need to find a chemically benign manner for storing herbarium specimens of Mirabilis, used in research which led to the work described in the previous chapters. The results show that valved <b>oxygen</b> barrier <b>bags,</b> designed for clothing storage, with a small number of oxygen absorbers, can retain conditions for sufficient periods to treat specimens for pests. This allows the bags to be used as inexpensive nitrogen chambers, to treat herbarium specimens in place of expensive nitrogen systems or freezers, and without the toxic chemicals historically used in herbaria for the same purpose...|$|R
40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} the control of lactic acid fermentation of selected plant substrates using microbial starters and enzyme preparation. Interactions between the starter culture of Enterococcus faecium M 74 and natural microflora were studied during the fermentation of cut onion and shredded cabbage. Fermentation experiments were held in evacuated plastic bags. The effect of probiotic-enzyme preparations on the course of beginning stages of ensilaging of wilted grass and alfalfa was studied. The evacuated plastic bags simulating the conditions during a large-scale ensiling technology were used. The starter culture of Enterococcus faecium M 74 {{was found to be}} a powerful tool for the control of lactic acid fermentation of cut onion and shredded cabbage. The results of the first part of experiments show that the use of starter culture allows to reduce the growth of heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria and to decreased production of their metabolites -acetic acid and carbon dioxide. The bigger inoculum of Enterococcus faecium M 74 in the range 104 to 108. g- 1 was used the faster production of lactic acid and corresponding decrease of pH value at the beginning stages of fermentation was observed. At the same time the production of carbon dioxide and acetic acid was reduced. The gas production during the fermentation cannot be totally suppressed by further increasing amount of inoculum due to the respiration of plant tissue. The starter culture also affected molds and yeast. The increasing amount of inoculum caused the inhibition of their growth at the beginning of fermentation and this effect did not correspond with the changes of the gas composition inside the package. The second part of experiments focused to the use of enzyme preparations during the ensilaging of wilted grasses and alfalfa shows that: glucose oxidase applied just before sealing the bag caused faster reduction of oxygen concentration inside the bag and slower carbon dioxide production. The fast introduction of anaerobic conditions inhibited the growth of molds and accelerated the production of butyric acid. During the fermentation of alfalfa the reduction of lactic acid production was observed too. Any effect of glucose oxidase on the pH value reduction was not found, it {{can be explained by the}} lack of <b>oxygen</b> inside the <b>bag.</b> To affect the pH value of ensilage the preparations should be added earlier before the silage sealing. The thesis summarizes the results of several years wide studies. The carried out experiments have been done usually as a part of practical study devoted to the given technological problem. In addition to a large number of "small" practical conclusions the new simple methodology allowing to follow the changes of the inside gas volume and composition was developedAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
5000|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a small fraction}} of inhaled oxygen—the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress and hypercapnia. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with (estimated) 50-60% O2 supplied from a copper tank and CO2 scrubbed by rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash; the system giving a duration of about three hours. This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel 1000 ft in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set. The rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled CO2 and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately 56 L of oxygen at a pressure of [...] which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted <b>oxygen</b> to the <b>bag</b> at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of to help keep the wearer afloat. The DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dräger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. The Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the Decima Flottiglia MAS, especially the Pirelli ARO. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used.|$|R
