40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} testing whether the volume <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> activity in a unionized firm or industry {{is affected by the}} cost of such activity as measured by output lost, and applies that method to Canadian data at the one-digit SIC level.

The results support the hypothesis that strike activity varies inversely with the cost <b>of</b> <b>strikes,</b> but this evidence is not strong, possibly due to the small sample size used in the cross-section analysis.

40|$|Some {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> activity {{suggest that}} the settlement probability <b>of</b> a <b>strike</b> depends {{on the number of}} workers involved in the strike. Additionally, much recent empirical research on strikes has been constrained by data availability to look only at strikes in large bargaining units. It is natural to ask, therefore, whether strike size systematically influences strike duration, and whether this question poses problems of interpretation for studies confined to samples <b>of</b> large <b>strikes.</b> This paper uses Canadian strike data to examine these questions. We find that size is an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> duration and also that studies <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> duration based only on large strikes can yield results that are not representative of the influences for all strikes. ...|$|R

5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind.

The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|E
5|$|The stipulations {{contained}} in the Act caused significant controversy during debates over NATO's military command structure. Both Striking Fleet Atlantic and the United States Sixth Fleet have never been allowed to be placed anywhere but directly under American commanding officers—the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe—because the dominant legal interpretation of the McMahon Act has been that nuclear striking forces cannot be controlled by non-US commanders. This {{was the reason for}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>Striking</b> Fleet Atlantic as an independent entity, instead of being operationally subordinated to the UK Admiral serving as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, in October–November 1952. This was also the reason why the Sixth Fleet, in its NATO guise as Naval Striking and Support Force, South, was placed under American control rather than Allied Forces Mediterranean when the European commands were agreed at the same time.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of rolling mills, presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E
5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E

5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the round number {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits {{to go to the}} tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was no thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> to appear on coins. The recession of 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, {{and tens of thousands of}} both dates remained unsold.
