500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} decade of his {{marriage}} to Ethel, Christie was convicted of several criminal offences. His first conviction was for stealing postal orders while working as a postman, for which he received three months' imprisonment on 12 April 1921. He was then convicted in January 1923 of obtaining money on false pretences and of violent conduct, for which, respectively, he was bound <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on 12months' probation. He committed two further crimes of larceny during 1924, and received consecutive sentences of three and six months' imprisonment from September 1924. [...] In May 1929, he was convicted of assaulting a prostitute with whom he was living in Battersea and was sentenced to six months' hard labour; Christie had hit her over the head with a cricket bat, which the magistrate described as a [...] "murderous attack". Finally, he was convicted of stealing a car from a priest who had befriended him, and was imprisoned for three months in late 1933.|$|E

6000|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Winces slightly.] Really? [Goes <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> {{his hand}} on GERALD'S shoulder.] You have missed not having a father, I suppose, Gerald? ...|$|R
60|$|CURTIS--You bet she has. [He goes <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> {{his hand}} on his wife's {{shoulder}} affectionately.] Martha's more efficient than a whole staff of assistants and secretaries. She knows more about what I'm doing than I do half the time. [He turns toward his study.] Well, I guess I'll go in and work some.|$|R
60|$|Some time later, {{several men}} {{came up to}} him. One leaned <b>over</b> him, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> {{his hand to his}} heart.|$|R
6000|$|Was there really, then, as {{the ancients}} thought, a Daemon that {{liked to play}} with men, as men liked to stir an earwig and turn it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> a foot {{on it in the}} end? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are trying}} to make out where they are," [...] said Decoud in a whisper. Again he leaned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> his fingers into the water. [...] "We are moving quite smartly," [...] he {{informed}} Nostromo.|$|E
6000|$|... "Atkinson {{will take}} the field off your hands. It's not usual to charge a tenant with needful repairs; and you mustn't be hard on Mrs. Olcott about the rent. Perhaps you had better go <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> things {{straight}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would have}} laughed," [...] said Arthur, [...] "to see me walking majestically along the High Street with a cudgel which Gresham had just bought {{for me as}} being of the proper medium size. I don't doubt he meant to have a fight. And then {{you should have seen}} the {{policeman}} sloping <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>putting</b> himself in the way. I never quite understood where that policeman came from." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Kidd bent <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>put</b> {{his hand}} affectionately on her shoulder. [...] "He escaped," [...] he said, in a thrilling whisper. [...] "He's alive and well." ...|$|R

"There's an {{excursion}} boat coming round the Point," [...] he said, {{pointing to the}} black smoke trail of a steamer {{at the entrance of}} a loch, [...] "and it will be returning to St. Kentigern shortly. If you like, we'll pull <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> you aboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet, Songbird." [...] Dick {{had been}} looking over toward {{the rear of the}} butcher shop. [...] "See, the {{painters}} are at work here and have left one of their ladders. Wonder if we can't move it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it up under one of those windows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} no trouble in getting at that, father," [...] Charlie said laughing, [...] "seeing that {{you have nothing to}} do but to lean <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> your hand into my holsters, which are so full, as you see, that I am forced to carry my pistols in my belt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father," [...] said Carry, {{as soon as}} the old man {{was again}} placed upon the bench. <b>And</b> she stood <b>over</b> him, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her hand upon his neck.|$|R
50|$|Cork's All-Ireland {{victory was}} their first since 1999. The win gave them their 29th All-Ireland title <b>over</b> all <b>and</b> <b>put</b> them as {{outright}} leaders on the all-time roll of honour.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Do you know, I think I {{have found}} out. She held aloof from us all, and treated us--especially me--as {{if we were}} her natural enemies, and I never could guess what was the reason till the other day; she voluntarily gave me up all her books to be looked <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into the common stock, which {{you saw in the}} schoolroom.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cassandry's, {{got him to}} go," [...] said Mr. Hopkins. [...] "It's all fixed, as sure as Sunday. If it misses fire, then I'll never {{mention the}} {{governorship}} again. But if it don't miss fire," [...] and the Honorable Alva leaned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> his hand on Jethro's knee, [...] "if it don't miss fire, I get the nomination. Is that right?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{brief but}} {{pregnant}} letter cost him some pains in its composition. He {{was not a}} ready writer. But he completed it at last to his satisfaction. There was a crisp purity in the style which pleased him. He read it <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> {{in a couple of}} commas. Then he placed it in an envelope, and lit another cigar.|$|E

6000|$|... "Leonard was as guarded and {{diplomatic}} as usual. He {{informed us that}} there had been some trouble at the mine and he was afraid you hadn't experience enough to deal with the situation. Then he gave us the impression that you were inclined to be rash and might make a mess of things unless he came <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> you right." ...|$|E
60|$|Had we been nearer home, {{and not at}} so {{very great}} an expense, as three ships, and so many men at victuals and wages, or had we been where we might have left one of our vessels to fish, and have come to them again, {{we would not have}} given it over while there had been an oyster left in the sea, or, at least, that we could come at: but as things stood, I {{resolved}} to give it <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> to sea.|$|E
6000|$|I {{do not see}} how {{a person}} can act so. It is {{good of you to}} repeat, with change of language, in the bulk of your rejoinder, so much of my own article, and adopt my sentiments, and make them <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> new buttons on; and I like the compliment, and am frank to say so; but agreeing with a person cripples {{controversy}} and ought not to be allowed. It is weather; and of almost the worst sort. It pleases me greatly to hear you discourse with such approval and expansiveness upon my text: ...|$|E
50|$|Clare's All-Ireland {{victory was}} their third in-a-row. The win gave them their fourth All-Ireland title <b>over</b> all <b>and</b> <b>put</b> them in joint fifth {{position}} with Limerick {{on the all-time}} roll of honour.|$|R

6000|$|... "You see now," [...] I pointed out, [...] "how {{lucky you}} were to get me behind you. You go to Jeeves, and what does he do? He dresses you up in scarlet tights {{and one of the}} foulest false beards of my experience, and sends you off to fancy-dress balls. Result, agony of spirit and no progress. I then take <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> you on the right lines. Could Jeeves have got you into Brinkley Court? Not a chance. Aunt Dahlia isn't his aunt. I merely mention these things." ...|$|E
60|$|Creech's aspect changed. The eagerness {{and sympathy}} fled from his face, leaving it once more hard and stern. He {{got up and}} stood a tall, dark, and gloomy man, {{brooding}} over his loss, {{as he watched the}} canyon. Still, there was in him then a struggle that Lucy felt. Presently he bent <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> his big hand on her head. It seemed gentle and tender compared with former contacts, and it made Lucy thrill. She could not see his face. What did he mean? She divined something startling, and sat there trembling in suspense.|$|E
60|$|Burgess was as rigidly {{conscientious}} as {{the captain}} of a school eleven should be. Bob {{was one of his}} best friends, and he would have given much {{to be able to put}} him in the team; but he thought the thing <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> the temptation sturdily behind him. At batting there was not much to choose between the two, but in fielding there was a great deal. Mike was good. Bob was bad. So out Bob had gone, and Neville-Smith, a fair fast bowler at all times and on his day dangerous, took his place.|$|E
