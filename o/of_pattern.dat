One variety each <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused.

5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on both natural and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the Nile crocodile, the evolution <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations <b>of</b> <b>pattern</b> and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E

30|$|Step 3 : In this step, the {{composition}} rule {{is applied to}} the periodic patterns obtained from the extensions <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> from all P_T^f groups to reduce the total number <b>of</b> <b>patterns.</b> We consider all pairs <b>of</b> periodic <b>patterns</b> such that a distance between their start points is no longer than a given threshold value. Then, a horizontal split rule is used to adjust the length <b>of</b> periodic <b>patterns</b> in each pair such that composition rule can be applied. The results from {{the composition}}s, i.e. the composed patterns and the split fragments <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> not used by composition rules are returned to an input set <b>of</b> periodic <b>patterns</b> and step 3 is repeated.

50|$|It {{would be}} {{possible}} for a computer program to search for orphan patterns by systematically examining all finite patterns, in order by increasing size, and by testing all possible predecessors for each pattern {{to determine whether it}} is in fact an orphan.

40|$|One of the {{important}} issues in data mining is the interestingness problem. This problem is described as finding the interesting patterns from a large number <b>of</b> discovered <b>patterns.</b> Typically, in a data mining application, it is {{all too easy to}} discover a huge number <b>of</b> <b>patterns.</b> Most <b>of</b> these <b>patterns</b> are actually useless or uninteresting to the user. But due to the huge number <b>of</b> <b>patterns,</b> it is difficult for a user to comprehend all the patterns and to identify those interesting to him/her. To prevent the user from being overwhelmed by the large number <b>of</b> <b>patterns,</b> techniques are needed to analyze and to rank the patterns according to their interestingness. This paper proposes such a technique. It performs post-analysis <b>of</b> the discovered <b>patterns</b> to help the user identify those interesting ones. The technique is based on fuzzy matching <b>of</b> the discovered <b>patterns</b> with a set <b>of</b> user-specified <b>patterns.</b> The degrees <b>of</b> match are then used to rank the discovered patterns according to vari [...] ...|$|R
