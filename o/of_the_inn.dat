5|$|Many noted barristers, {{judges and}} {{politicians}} were members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> during this period, including Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls, Edmund Pelham, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and Francis Bacon, {{who served as}} Treasurer for eight years, supervising significant changes to the facilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> and the first proper construction of the gardens and walks for which the Inn is noted.|$|E
5|$|In 1456 Reginald de Gray, {{the owner}} of the Manor itself, sold the land to a group {{including}} Thomas Bryan. A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a feoffee or an owner representing the governing body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> partially back to the Gray family.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{marked the}} end of legal {{education}} at the Inns, and the class of Readers went into decline. The last Readers were appointed in 1677, and the position of the Readers as heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> and members of Pension was taken by the Benchers.|$|E
5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court after graduation. If he studied at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> <b>of</b> Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Gray's <b>Inn,</b> <b>the</b> attached <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|R

5|$|In 1506 the Inn {{was sold}} by the Gray family to Hugh Denys {{and a group of}} his feoffees {{including}} Roger Lupton. This was not a purchase on behalf of the society and after a five-year delay, it was transferred under the will of Denys in 1516 to the Carthusian House of Jesus of Bethlehem (Sheen Priory), which remained the Society's landlord until 1539, when the Second Act of Dissolution led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and passed ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The Angel Inn {{became a}} useful stop when {{travelling}} to the City of London, as the rural area outside {{it was considered}} dangerous, with travellers having armed escorts from Wood's Close to Islington. Despite its name, and common association with Islington, the grounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> {{and all of the}} western edge of Islington High Street were in neighbouring Clerkenwell.|$|E
5|$|The Caroline period saw {{a decline}} in {{prosperity}} for Gray's Inn. Although there were many notable members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn,</b> both legal (Sir Dudley Digges, Thomas Bedingfield and Francis Bacon, for example) and non-legal (including William Juxon, the Archbishop of Canterbury), the list could not compare {{to that of the}} Elizabethan period. Following the English Restoration, admissions fell to an average of 57 a year.|$|E

25|$|Lyon's <b>Inn</b> was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery {{attached}} to London's Inner Temple. Founded some time during or before <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Henry V, <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> educated lawyers including Edward Coke and John Selden, {{although it was}} never one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger <b>Inns.</b> It eventually developed into an institution of disrepute rather than of respect, {{and by the time}} it was dissolved in 1863 it was inhabited by only the worst lawyers.|$|R
50|$|From 2000 to 2003, {{he served}} as Chancellor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court, and was from 1996 to 2001 a {{governor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court School of Law. He {{has been a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Legal Advisory Commission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> England since 1988 and Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clergy Discipline Commission and Clergy Discipline Tribunal since 2004.

5|$|The period saw the {{establishment}} of a regular system of legal education. In the early days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn,</b> the quality of legal education had been poor—readings were given infrequently, and the standards for call to the Bar were weak and varied. During the Elizabethan age readings were given regularly, moots took place daily and barristers who were called to the Bar were expected to play a part in teaching students, resulting in skilled and knowledgeable graduates from the Inn.|$|E
5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they walked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the Hall are {{decorated}} with paintings of noted patrons or members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn,</b> including Nicholas Bacon and Elizabeth I. During the Second World War the Hall {{was one of those}} buildings badly damaged during the Blitz. The Treasurers' Arms and paintings had been moved to a place of safety and were not damaged; during the rebuilding after the War they were put back in the Hall, where they remain. The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
50|$|He was Knight President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society <b>of</b> Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Round Table from 1993. He {{was also}} Honorary Colonel <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court and City Yeomanry.|$|R
50|$|Giffard {{received}} a brief legal education. Initially {{he was at}} <b>the</b> Strand <b>Inn,</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery attached to the Middle Temple. On 11 November 1512 he {{was admitted to the}} Inner Temple.|$|R
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery was <b>the</b> first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery, {{where he would}} be taught in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> <b>of</b> Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to <b>the</b> parent <b>Inn</b> <b>of</b> Court and begin <b>the</b> next stage <b>of</b> their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Chancery at any one time.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant {{is as good as}} any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{formed on}} the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under d'Erlon with 16,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under Reille with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> La Belle Alliance were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the Imperial Guard, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.|$|E
5|$|The French right, left, and centre had all now failed. The last {{cohesive}} French force {{consisted of}} two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around La Belle Alliance; they had been so placed {{to act as a}} final reserve and to protect Napoleon {{in the event of a}} French retreat. He hoped to rally the French army behind them, but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of La Belle Alliance, in square as protection against Coalition cavalry. Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn.</b> Adam's Brigade charged and forced back this square, while the Prussians engaged the other.|$|E
50|$|He was {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Executive Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court and <b>the</b> Bar from 1973 to 1977 and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate between 1984 and 1986.|$|R
25|$|Following his {{retirement}} as a serving officer, Hill became under-treasurer, <b>the</b> chief executive, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Temple, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court, and held that post {{for ten years}} until {{his retirement}} in 1994, when he was made Hon.

50|$|Because of {{its initial}} links with Gray's <b>Inn,</b> <b>the</b> {{regiment}} claimed descent from <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court Volunteers <b>of</b> 1780. <b>The</b> Rangers were actually founded to accommodate members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court {{who did not}} wish to join <b>the</b> exclusive 23rd (<b>Inns</b> <b>of</b> Court) Middlesex RVC, which had a better claim to descent from The Devil's Own.|$|R
5|$|The Library of Gray's Inn {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1555, when the first mention of it {{was made in the}} will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> had been found stealing books.|$|E
5|$|A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E
25|$|Benchers are, {{and have}} been for centuries, the {{governing}} bodies of the four Inns of Court in London and King's Inns, Dublin. The Benchers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> of Court of Northern Ireland governed the Inn until {{the enactment of the}} Constitution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> in 1983, which provides that the government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> is shared between the Benchers, the Executive Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> assembled in General Meeting.|$|E

25|$|The Executive Council (through its Education Committee) is {{responsible}} for considering Memorials submitted by applicants for admission as students <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> and by Bar students <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> for admission {{to the degree of}} Barrister-at-Law and making recommendations to the Benchers. The final decisions on these Memorials are taken by the Benchers. The Benchers also have the exclusive power of expelling or suspending a Bar student and of disbarring a barrister or suspending a barrister from practice.|$|E
25|$|He {{altered the}} {{dynamics}} of the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inn</b> Scene, making the conclusion loud and bombastic, perhaps because he was dissatisfied that all of Mussorgsky's scenes {{with the exception of the}} Coronation Scene end quietly.|$|E
25|$|Richard Nyren, a {{landlord}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inn</b> from 1762 to 1772, was the Hambledon Club's team captain. Nyren was succeeded as landlord by William Barber, another well-known Hambledon cricketer, {{who held the}} licence until 1784.|$|E
