Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E

It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher <b>output</b> <b>power,</b> improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments.

Pulsewidths as short as 23 ps and peak powers of ower 1 W are generated in a single-lobed beam. Mode-locked semiconductor lasers are attractive as compact sources of short optical pulses for use in physics measurements, for instrumentation systems, and for telecommunications applications. Such lasers operate with average <b>output</b> <b>powers</b> of typically a few milliwatts, which limits their use in applications where higher power is required.

Ten subjects performed 3 sets of the clean exercise at 65, 75, and 85 % of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM).

All peak mechanical <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were expressed as relative peak power by either ratio (watts per kilogram) or allometrically scaling to body mass (W·kg- 0. 67). Correlation coefficients were used to compare <b>power</b> <b>output</b> measures. The greatest numbers of significant correlations between internal and external <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were observed at 85 % of 1 RM, at this load hip and knee joint <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were correlated to external mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> when calculated with the traditional work-energy method.
