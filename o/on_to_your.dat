500|$|Physical {{copies of}} the album feature {{different}} packaging with a cover image of drummer Larry Mullen Jr. protectively embracing his then-18-year-old son while both are shirtless. The image was taken by photographer Glen Luchford initially as an experiment, but the group thought it worked as a visual metaphor for the album and its theme of [...] "how holding <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own innocence is {{a lot harder than}} holding on to someone else's". Bono said, [...] "With this record we were looking for the raw, naked and personal, to strip everything back." [...] According to Bono, the tattoo on Mullen's upper arm is based on Native American mythology of the Pawnee tribe and is a symbol of protecting innocence. The cover parallels those of the band's earlier albums, Boy (1980) and War (1983), which featured the face of a young boy, Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Guggi.|$|E

Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name [...] "Frank Black" [...] (inverting his old persona [...] "Black Francis") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in [...] "I Heard Ramona Sing", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, [...] "but {{at the same time}} it is an island, like nothing else he [...] did." ...|$|E

Simpson has described [...] "Nothing New" [...] as being about her frustration with an ex-boyfriend's [...] "dramas", until she is ultimately [...] "finished with him", while [...] "Giving It All Away" [...] encourages the listener {{to stand on}} one's own feet: [...] "hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> life and don't give that away", Simpson said of the song. The album's closing track, [...] "Undiscovered" [...] (which Simpson has described as a favorite of hers), was written after her breakup with Josh, and is described by epinions.com as a song with [...] "haunting strings" [...] and [...] "mellow guitars"; in the song, Simpson ponders {{what might have been}} in a lost pairing. Non-U.S. pressings follow with [...] "Harder Everyday", and the United Kingdom edition adds [...] "Sorry", while the Japanese edition closes with [...] "Endless Summer".

500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back in and do an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were so totally offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang <b>On</b> <b>to</b> <b>Your</b> Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was worried about him separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E
500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodesâ€”and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. [...] This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal... so, hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> hats. [...] Those of you waiting for the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy. [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.|$|E

[...] Despite concerns over the song's drug references, the key lyric [...] "they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night" [...] was kept for the final version. Elsewhere for [...] "Sloop John B", Wilson's lyric change from [...] "this is the worst trip since I've been born" [...] to [...] "this is the worst trip I've ever been on" [...] has also been suggested to be another subtle nod to acid culture.|$|E

[...] "Push Comes To Shove" [...] and [...] "Willing" [...] described Scott-Heron's philosophy to the pressures of life, and [...] "Late Last Night" [...] was inspired by his touring life {{and the process of}} writing music. He wrote the latter as an account of waking up in a hotel room with an idea for a song but being unable to find a paper or instrument to compose. The narrative found him fighting with staff to use the hotel's lounge piano, while losing the song's melody and lyrics from his memory in the distraction. On the title track, Scott-Heron voiced feelings of alienation and disillusionment with the future while reflecting on the past.|$|E

The track was later released as a single in 1981 and peaked at No. 60. [...] "Hold <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>Your</b> Hats" [...] is a mid-tempo track influenced by a more rock 'n' roll sound. The track uses backward reverb effects and features a question and answer technique between Holder and the other band members Hill and Lea during the chorus. [...] "Chakeeta" [...] is a more commercial sounding track on the album. [...] "Don't Waste Your Time (Back Seat Star)" [...] is an acoustic-based ballad, described by Holder in 1988 as a [...] "surrealistic social comment".

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave 1980 an [...] "Aâ€“" [...] and hailed it as Scott-Heron and Jackson's best album yet. [...] "The melodies are only functional", he wrote, [...] "but the rhythms are seductive and the singing is warm." [...] Christgau ranked {{it as the}} 32nd best record of 1980 in his year-end list for the Pazz & Jop critics poll. Geoff Brown from Black Music & Jazz Review gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and said Scott-Heron's songs were one of the few remedies for alleviating the [...] "creeping suspicion which must afflict us all from time to time, that black artists can only write convincingly these days about the topics of love and dancing." [...] AllMusic's Jeff Schwachter also gave it four stars in a retrospective review, finding it abundant with [...] "perceptive and poignant observations on the state of America as it advanced into a new and uncertain decade". In Schwachter's opinion, the music retained past styles amidst exceptional arrangements of synthesizers, horns, and background vocals, all of which gave the record [...] "a quality that matched the aura of the period", especially on [...] "Alien (Hold <b>On</b> <b>to</b> <b>Your</b> Dreams)".|$|E
2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating."

He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound â€“ if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{reported}} {{a dispute over}} the meaning of [...] Rava taught that King Manasseh of Judah tried and executed Isaiah, charging Isaiah with false prophesy based, among other things, on a contradiction between [...] and Isaiah's teachings. Manasseh argued that when (as reported in [...] ) Moses quoted God saying, [...] "The number of your days I will fulfill," [...] God meant that God would allow people to live out their appointed lifespan, but not add to it. But Manasseh noted that Isaiah told Manasseh's father Hezekiah (as reported in [...] ) that God promised Hezekiah, [...] "I will add <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> days fifteen years." [...] According to Rava, Isaiah did not dispute Manasseh's charges, knowing that Manasseh would not accept Isaiah's argument, no matter how truthful, and Manasseh had Isaiah killed. The Gemara reported that the Tannaim disagreed about the interpretation of the words [...] "the number of your days I will fulfill" [...] in [...] A Baraita taught that [...] "the number of your days I will fulfill" [...] refers to the lifespan that God allots to every human being at birth. Rabbi Akiba taught that if one is worthy, God allows one to complete the full period; if unworthy, God reduces the number of years. The Sages, however, taught that if one is worthy, God adds years to one's life; if one is unworthy, God reduces the years. The Sages argued to Rabbi Akiba that Isaiah's prophesy to Hezekiah in [...] "And I will add to your days fifteen years," [...] supports the Sages' interpretation. Rabbi Akiba replied that God made the addition to Hezekiah's lifespan from years that God had originally intended for Hezekiah that Hezekiah had previously lost due to sin. Rabbi Akiba cited in support of his position the words of the prophet in the days of Jeroboam, before the birth of Hezekiah, who prophesied (as reported in [...] ), [...] "a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name." [...] Rabbi Akiba argued that since the prophet prophesied the birth of Manasseh's son Josiah before the birth of Manasseh's father Hezekiah, it must be that at Hezekiah's birth God had allotted to Hezekiah enough years to extend beyond the time of Hezekiah's illness (when Isaiah prophesied in [...] ) so as to include the year of Manasseh's birth. Consequently, Rabbi Akiba argued, at the time of Hezekiah's illness, God must have reduced the original number of years allotted to Hezekiah, and upon Hezekiah's recovery, God must have added back only that which God had previously reduced. The Rabbis, however, argued back that the prophet in the days of Jeroboam who prophesied in [...] did not prophesy that Josiah would necessarily descend from Hezekiah. The prophet prophesied in [...] that Josiah would be born [...] "to the house of David." [...] Thus Josiah might have descended either from Hezekiah or from some other person in the Davidic line.|$|E
