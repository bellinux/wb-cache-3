25|$|Since genetic {{recombination}} has occurred, a cultivar grown from seed will have different characteristics from its parent(s), thus {{should never be}} given a parent's name. The wild species have evolved {{in the absence of}} other Canna genes and are usually true to type when the parents are of the same species, but a degree of variance still occurs. The species C. indica is an aggregate species, having many different and extreme forms ranging from the giant to miniature, from large foliage to small foliage, both green and dark foliage, and many different coloured blooms, red, <b>orange,</b> <b>pink,</b> and yellow, and combinations of those colours.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the houses}} in the {{district}} are built in the traditional style with wooden beams, raised off of the ground on stilts and covered with thatched/bamboo roofs. The locals, especially the Tam Dao and Tai Lue people, are adept at silk and cotton weaving. The Tam Dao weave sins (traditional Lao skirts), scarves and works of art. The Tai Lue cotton weavers in villages such as Nong Boua and Xieng Yun make dyes consisting of a blend of leaves, flowers, insects and wood and weave traditional cotton textiles. The women of the Akha ethnic group are also skilled at making heavy indigo-dyed cotton fabric, generally used to make bags, clothes and other souvenirs to sell to tourists. The Yao people are noted in particular for their needlework and embroidery and are skilled in making trousers, tunics and turbans. Between November to January, they produce a durable bamboo paper which is dried and later used as paper, primarily for religious purposes. The Hmong also manufacture embroidered clothing, bags and blankets for special ceremonies and festivals. The locals manufacture banners with bright colors such as <b>orange,</b> <b>pink,</b> blue, green, red and purple and often feature animals, humans and with Buddhist themes. The banners are typically 2 or 3 metres in length and 1ft in diameter and are often adorned with beads, sequins, tassels, metal foil and paper.|$|E

500|$|Daffodils may be self-coloured—i.e., both {{perianth}} and corona {{identical in}} colour and shade—or the colours between the perianth and corona may differ widely. Some perianths and some coronas may also contain {{more than one}} colour or shade. Prevalent colours are all shades and tones of yellow, white, <b>orange,</b> <b>pink,</b> red and green. Pinks vary from apricot to rose in shades from pale to deep, and some more recent cultivars have hints of lavender or lilac. Reds vary from orange-red to salmon red to near scarlet. Pink, red, orange and green tones are mainly confined to the corona. However, breeders are currently working against the genus' natural pigmentation and genetic barriers to create cultivars in which pink, rose, red, orange and green tones suffuse or [...] "bleed" [...] from the more highly coloured coronas onto the perianth segments of white or yellow. There is {{an increasing number of}} commercially available varieties which display this enhanced colouration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} green colouration {{is almost}} universally predominant; [...] {{with the two}} exceptions of male N. rudis as well as males of some populations of the Canterbury form of N. gemmeus, which are sexually dichromatic. While females are green, the males of N. rudis are grey with white and brown splotches, and in Canterbury, N. gemmeus females are always predominantly green {{as compared to the}} grey, brown or white males. The inside of the mouth, which is revealed in a threat display in some species, is deep blue, <b>orange,</b> <b>pink</b> or red. The broad fleshy tongue, which has a major function in cleaning the transparent scales which cover the eyes, is also brightly coloured; depending on the species it is red, <b>orange,</b> <b>pink,</b> yellow or black. The ears of New Zealand geckos appear as small openings {{on the side of the}} head behind the eyes, and the eardrum is visible a short distance inside this opening.|$|E

Persistent morning drizzle occurs occasionally from June through September, coating {{the streets with}} {{a thin layer of}} water that generally dries up by early afternoon.

50|$|Pink LEDs can be {{produced}} using two methods, either with a blue LED using two phosphors (yellow for the first phosphor, and red, <b>orange,</b> or <b>pink</b> for the second), or by placing a pink dye {{on top of a}} white LED. Color shifting was a common issue with early pink LEDs, where the red, <b>orange,</b> or <b>pink</b> phosphors or dyes faded over time, causing the pink color to eventually shift towards white or blue. These issues have been mitigated by the more recent introduction of more fade-resistant phosphors.|$|R
