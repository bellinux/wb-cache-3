5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the <b>organisation,</b> <b>structure,</b> training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the <b>organisation</b> <b>structure</b> of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E

40|$|Chinese family {{businesses}} {{have been studied}} by abundant researchers in the early 1960 s. Gordon Redding as one of these researchers carefully defines <b>organisation</b> <b>structures</b> of Chinese family businesses throughout his systematic investigations that were published in 1990, whereas recent statistics of Chinese family businesses in China show the different perspective against Redding (1990). Therefore, this research is to examine differences on <b>organisation</b> <b>structures</b> between Redding (1990) and an empirical finding in Shanghai, China. This research employs a qualitative research method to investigate recruitment & selection and retention in a Chinese family business in order to explore <b>organisation</b> <b>structures</b> in recent Chinese family businesses. The findings of this research reveal inconsistencies between Redding (1990) and actual performance of Chinese family businesses, while they fit in with Chen’s (2001) three transformation paths, and thus to present reasons and ways of changing on <b>organisation</b> <b>structures</b> within Chinese family businesses...|$|R

In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist. The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the Central Council for British Naturism or CCBN.

Each Director is responsible for maintenance of his zone and is supported by a receiver and a controller. Hundreds of lock-keepers are responsible for the locks. This organization facilitates the control and hiring of employees.|$|E

Local government authorities have been adjusting their structures in response to numerous business and community imperatives, but without full knowledge of the actual impacts on staff motivation. Using a multiple case study analysis, looking at three councils and interviewing middle managers, their peers, subordinates and superiors to provide a multi-perspective understanding, this project seeks to explain how structures shape perceptions of empowerment. This study makes a unique contribution to existing literature and industry knowledge on empowerment through focusing on the interplay of <b>organisation</b> <b>structures</b> and managerial empowerment within a context of local government. The outcomes of this study will better inform the industry to create more empowered and effective workplaces, leading to improved services and connection with local communities...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} the idea of information fulfilment. The networked society provides many opportunities for information flow. However, information professionals readily accept that, although one is surrounded by information of many sorts, in many formats, what is important is whether users consider that they ever achieve what is known as “Information Fulfilment”. i. e. occurrences when there has been information which is accurate, timely, current and presented in an appropriate and useful format to allow (work) tasks to be completed. Design/methodology/approach – This first paper contains a literature review which informed the study. The study (which will be reported in detail in a later paper) was interpretive and used ethnography (through participant observation) as the research tool. The research deals with issues surrounding <b>organisation</b> <b>structures</b> and examines levels of information fulfilment in micro substantive settings.
