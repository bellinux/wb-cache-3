5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest {{capital gains tax cut}} in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E

5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which {{is home to the}} world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased restrictions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized {{the use of}} harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} adoption of search and recommendation technologies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, empirical research that examines {{the effect of}} these technologies is scarce. How do online consumers use these technologies? Does consumers' technology usage have an effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> to them or their purchasing patterns? This paper empirically measures consumers' usage of website technologies by analyzing server log data. We match technology usage data to sales data, controlling for consumers' historical purchasing behavior. Our unique data set allows us to reveal the relationship between technology usage and online sales. Our analyses show that consumers' information technology usage has a significant effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> to them, but this effect varies for different technologies and across different products. In particular, the use of directed search has a positive effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> promoted products, whereas it has a negative effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> nonpromoted products. In contrast, the use of a recommendation system has a positive effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> both promoted and nonpromoted products. Surprisingly, the use of nondirected search has an insignificant effect on online sales. electronic commerce, Internet, technology usage, online sales, search, recommendation...|$|R

5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> public lands.|$|E
5|$|In December 1940, Bell conciliated {{the sale}} of Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson, and then Rooney {{acquired}} half of Bell's interest in the Eagles. In {{a series of events}} known as the Pennsylvania Polka, Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh. Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the Steelers. Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, China {{became the}} first export {{customer}} for the Su-35 when the Russian and Chinese governments signed a contract worth $2billion {{for the purchase of}} 24aircraft for the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Although Chinese officials had first shown interest in the modernized Su-35 design in 2006, it was not until 2010 when Rosoboronexport, the Russian state agency responsible for the export and import of defence products, was ready to start talks with the Chinese government <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the Su-35. Russian officials publicly confirmed that talks had been going on in 2012, when a protocol agreement on the purchase of the aircraft was signed. There were subsequent media reports and official remarks that the two countries had signed a contract and deliveries of the aircraft were imminent, but negotiations would not actually conclude until 2015.|$|E

5|$|The NFL's {{struggle}} against the AAFC generated stress on wages, attendance, marketing, and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years. Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> home tickets. Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the 1949 championship game. Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from {{the outcome of the}} case weighed heavily on Bell.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{the court}} ruled that Van Meegeren’s estate be {{auctioned}} and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the buyers of his works and to pay income taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> his paintings. Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945. On 5 and 6 September 1950, the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court, along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art, including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection. The house was auctioned separately on 4 September, estimated to be worth 65,000 guilders. The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123,000 guilders. Van Meegeren’s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2,300 guilders, while Jesus among the Doctors (which van Meegeren had painted while in detention) sold for 3,000 guilders (about $800 or about $7,000 today.) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church. The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242,000 guilders ($60,000, or about $500,000 today).|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
