5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} <b>on</b> <b>short</b> points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he {{has been known to}} run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, to decommission facilities and — <b>on</b> <b>short</b> notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals.
