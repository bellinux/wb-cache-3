Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of IzÃºcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla.

Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|E
