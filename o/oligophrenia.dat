40|$|Thirty one cases (10 to 17 years old) of the {{so-called}} 2 ̆ 7 simple 2 ̆ 7 <b>oligophrenia</b> were clinically studied and transversely examined on 25 checking items. From these results, the individual cases were analized on the etiological aspects and then the possibilities and limitations of causal analyses of the disease were discussed based on the present understandings. The conclusions were as follows : 1) The results from the transverse examinations were as follows : i. 2 ̆ 7 Cultural-familial 2 ̆ 7 mental retardation (AAMD Code No. 81) was seemed to require further genetic investigations. ii. Causative significance of the peri-natal disturbances in simple <b>oligophrenia</b> was evaluated generally as very small. iii. Degeneration 2 ̆ 7 s signs were considered etiologically important, because they suggested the organ-dysgenesis at the early stage of fetal periods. iv. For diagnostic purposes, cautious neurological examinations should be executed in order to overlook subclinical brain damages such as 2 ̆ 7 soft sign 2 ̆ 7. v. On the E. E. G. studies, 2 ̆ 7 atypical sleep pattern 2 ̆ 7 by the sleep activation, especially, 2 ̆ 7 extreme spindle 2 ̆ 7 was commonly observed. vi. Majority of the present cases showed a 2 ̆ 7 late-mature tendency 2 ̆ 7 of the sexual developments. 2) Generally speaking, simple oligophrenic states were resulted from the interaction of multi-dimensional and co-existing determinants. Their etiological varieties were determined {{by the number of}} causative factors and their evaluative weights. 3) It appears that even judging only from clinical view points this particular condition might include certain pathological groups which could not be considered as simple <b>oligophrenia.</b> 4) Almost all the subjects had the causal relations to the pre-natal or fetal period. Therefore, the most careful investigations should be done about the convergent causal factors during the cellular, germinal, and embryonal periods. 5) It was very hard to find a simple straight relationship to the mental retardation not only from the abnormal or pathological findings at the present semiological level but also from the causative factors at the level of etiological analysis. 6) This limitation of etiological stand points was considered to be a reflection of the relative limitation of general oligophrenia-diagnostics including clinical examinations at the present level. We also expected that the simple <b>oligophrenia</b> as a diagnostic category was going to separate to more accurate forms in the near future...|$|E

40|$|HENYLKETONURIA (phenylpyruvic <b>oligophrenia)</b> is a {{metabolic}} dis-order first {{recognized by}} Foiling (1) approximately 25 years ago. He found that two mentally retarded children in. {{the same family}} excreted urine containing a substance which gave a green color with ferric chloride. This substance was identified as phenylpyruvic acid. It has subsequently been recognized that in phenylketonuria a block in the utilization of phenylalanine causes this amino acid to accumu-late in the blood. The work of Wallace, Moldave and Meister (2) suggests that the deficiency in. the utilization of phenylalanine by the phenyilcetonuric {{may be due to}} the absence of at least one component of an enzyme system which effects the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. With the increase of serum phenylalanine, an accompany-ing irreversible injury to the brain occurs which may or may not be due to direct toxic effect of phenylalanine. A portion of the phenyl-alanine is deaminated to phenylpyruvic acid which appears in the urine. Recent innovations in diet therapy indicate successful treat-ment of phenylpyruvic <b>oligophrenia</b> (3), and this development makes the early detection of the disorder an important practical procedure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Platelet {{adhesion}} to subendothelial collagen {{is dependent}} on the integrin alpha 2 beta 1 and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptors. The major signaling routes in collagen-dependent platelet activation are outlined; however, crucial detailed knowledge of the actual phosphorylation events mediating them is still limited. Here, we explore phosphotyrosine signaling events downstream of GPVI with site-specific detail. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Immunoprecipitations of phosphotyrosine-modified peptides from protein digests of GPVI-activated and resting human platelets were compared by stable isotope-based quantitative mass spectrometry. We surveyed 214 unique phosphotyrosine sites over 2 time points, of which 28 showed a significant increase in phosphorylation on GPVI activation. Among these was Tyr 370 of oligophrenin- 1 (OPHN 1), a Rho GTPase-activating protein. To elucidate the function of OPHN 1 in platelets, we performed an array of functional platelet analyses within a small cohort of patients with rare <b>oligophrenia.</b> Because of germline mutations in the OPHN 1 gene locus, these patients lack OPHN 1 expression entirely and are in essence a human knockout model. Our studies revealed that among other unaltered properties, patients with <b>oligophrenia</b> show normal P-selectin exposure and alphaIIbbeta 3 activation in response to GPVI, as well as normal aggregate formation on collagen under shear conditions. Finally, the major difference in OPHN 1 -deficient platelets {{turned out to be a}} significantly reduced collagen-induced filopodia formation. CONCLUSIONS: In-depth phosphotyrosine screening revealed many novel signaling recipients downstream of GPVI activation uncovering a new level of detail within this important pathway. To illustrate the strength of such data, functional follow-up of OPHN 1 in human platelets deficient in this protein showed reduced filopodia formation on collagen, an important parameter of platelet hemostatic function...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} presentation {{of children with}} Joubert syndrome can include nonspecific features such as hypotonia, ataxia, and developmental delay. Careful examination of the face shows a characteristic appearance, and a neuro-ophthalmologic examination shows the presence of oculomotor apraxia. In the neonatal period, most children have hyperpnea intermixed with central apnea. Neuroimaging of the head in the axial plane demonstrates the "molar tooth sign"&mdash;deep posterior interpeduncular fossa, thick and elongated superior cerebellar peduncles, and hypoplastic or aplastic superior cerebellar vermis. The central nervous system malformation spectrum observed in radiologic and neuropathologic studies accounts for many clinical features of Joubert syndrome. The developmental delay and cognitive impairment cannot be fully explained by the hindbrain malformation and probably result from dysfunction of the cerebral hemispheres. Although related con-ditions with vermian hypoplasia or aplasia (including Arima; Senior-Loken; and cerebellar vermian hypoplasia, <b>oligophrenia,</b> congenital ataxia, coloboma, and hepatic fibrosis syndromes) can mimic Joubert syndrome, detailed imaging data are lack-ing in such cases.

40|$|Este trabalho destinou-se a verificar a freqüência dos fatores etiológicos que podem atuar em casos de distúrbios de conduta quando os sintomas básicos são irritabilidade, agressividade, impulsividade e instabilidade psico-motora. Foram revistas 100 observações de pacientes menores, de ambos os sexos, com idade variando entre 5 a 16 anos, atendidos no Ambulatório do Serviço de Psiquiatria Infantil do Hospital de Psiquiatria da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo. Em 15 pacientes não foi possível evidenciar circunstâncias ou fatores orgânicos que pudessem estar diretamente relacionados à etiologia dos citados distúrbios. Nos demais, foram encontrados fatores etiológicos provavelmente relacionados com o quadro clínico, na seguinte freqüência: disritmia {{cerebral}}, em 69 casos; condições ambientais desfavoráveis, em 37 casos; oligofrenia, em 35 casos; sofrimento cerebral, em 3 casos. A importância dos fatores ambientais e da oligofrenia na gênese dos distúrbios de conduta já é plenamente conhecida e por isso não surpreende a freqüência com que foram encontrados. Inesperada, no entanto, foi a alta incidência de disritmia cerebral nesta casuística: 68 % contra mais ou menos 10 % encontrados na população em geral, segundo os estudos de eletrencefalografia e epilepsia. Diferença tão grande dispensa análise estatística e indica um fator de extrema importância na origem dos distúrbios de conduta que, entretanto, não costuma ser valorizado e nem mesmo citado nos estudos sobre esse tema. As conclusões deste trabalho sugerem uma revisão na terapêutica dos distúrbios de conduta. Ao lado dos métodos pedagógicos e psicoterápicos, únicos habitualmente recomendados, deve ser incluído o tratamento antiepilético, uma vez que, em nossa experiência esta pode dar ótimos resultados sobre a irritabilidade, a agressividade, a impulsividade e a instabilidade manifestadas em pacientes com disritmia cerebral. This {{work was}} developed in order to verify the rate of occurance of the etiological factors which may actuate in cases of behaviour disturbs, when the basic symptoms are irritability, agressiveness, impulsiveness and psycho-motor instability; 100 observations were reviewed, of patients of both sexes, whose ages varied withing the range of 5 to 16 years old and who were assisted at the Child Psychiatry Service, University of São Paulo School of Medicine. In 15 of these patients {{it was not possible}} to make clear the organic circumstances or psychological factors which might be directly related to the etiology of such above mentioned disturbs. As to the remaining patients, etiological factors were found which are probably related to the clinical chart in the following rate of occurance: cerebral disrythmia, in 69 cases; unfavourable environment conditions, in 37 cases; <b>oligophrenia,</b> in 35 cases; cerebral damage, in 3 cases. The importance of the environment factors and <b>oligophrenia</b> in the genesis of behaviour disturbs is already well known and, therefore, their rate of occurance does not cause any surprise. It was unexpected, however, the high incidence of cerebral disrythmia in this work: 68 % against approximately 10 % found among the population in general, according to the monographs about epilepsy and electroencepholography. So great a difference exempts any statistic analysis and indicates an extremely important factor in the origin of behaviour disturbs which, however, is not usually valuated and not even mentioned in the studies about that subject. The final conclusions of this work suggest a reviewal in the therapeutics of behaviour disturbs. Together with the pedagogic and psychotherapic methods, the sole ones usually recommended, also the anti-epileptic treatment must be included, once in our experiments this treatment can provide good results over irritability, agressiveness, impulsiveness and instability shown by patients with cerebral disrythmia...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 1968, De Barsy {{reported}} on a girl exhibiting an aged aspect, 'dwarfism, <b>oligophrenia,</b> and degeneration of the elastic tissue in cornea and skin'. The disorder was recognized as a subgroup of cutis laxa syndrome and termed De Barsy-Moens-Dierckx syndrome. The pathogenesis of the disorder is unknown. Methods: To improve the comprehension of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the De Barsy syndrome, we performed an ultrastructural, morphometric, immunocytochemical study on a skin biopsy of a boy with the De Barsy phenotype, who has been clinically followed for 12 years from birth. Moreover, the lysyl oxidase activity was measured on skin fibroblasts cultured in vitro. Results: Light and electron microscopy, morphometry, and immunocytochemical observations showed a significant reduction of the elastic fibers in the papillary and in the reticular dermis of patient compared to an age-matched control (p < 0. 05). By contrast, the collagen structure, content, and the distribution were normal, as well as lysyl oxidase activity in the medium of in vitro fibroblasts (12, 323 DPM/ 10 (6) cells). The immunoreaction for antibodies recognizing fibrillin- 1, neutrophilic elastase, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha was stronger, whereas that for antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta was less pronounced in the dermis of the De Barsy boy compared to control. Conclusions: Clinical, phenotypic, and structural data {{were consistent with the}} diagnosis of De Barsy syndrome. This is the first case described in Italy. Clinical and structural data confirm that the elastic component is mostly affected in this disorder. Moreover, ultrastructural and immunochemical findings suggest that both elastic fiber degradative and very likely synthetic processes are involved...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} genetic {{causes of}} COACH syndrome BACKGROUND: COACH syndrome {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder characterised by Cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, <b>Oligophrenia</b> (developmental delay/mental retardation), Ataxia, Coloboma, and Hepatic fibrosis. The vermis hypoplasia falls in a spectrum of mid-hindbrain malformation called the molar tooth sign (MTS), making COACH a Joubert syndrome related disorder (JSRD). METHODS: In a cohort of 251 families with JSRD, 26 subjects in 23 families met criteria for COACH syndrome, defined as JSRD plus clinically apparent liver disease. Diagnostic criteria for JSRD were clinical findings (intellectual impairment, hypotonia, ataxia) plus supportive brain imaging findings (MTS or cerebellar vermis hypoplasia). MKS 3 /TMEM 67 was sequenced in all subjects for whom DNA was available. In COACH subjects without MKS 3 mutations, CC 2 D 2 A, RPGRIP 1 L and CEP 290 were also sequenced. RESUlTS: 19 / 23 families (83 %) with COACH syndrome carried MKS 3 mutations, compared to 2 / 209 (1 %) with JSRD but no liver disease. Two other families with COACH carried CC 2 D 2 A mutations, one family carried RPGRIP 1 L mutations, and one lacked mutations in MKS 3, CC 2 D 2 A, RPGRIP 1 L and CEP 290. Liver biopsies from three subjects, each with mutations {{in one of the}} three genes, revealed changes within the congenital hepatic fibrosis/ductal plate malformation spectrum. In JSRD with and without liver disease, MKS 3 mutations account for 21 / 232 families (9 %). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in MKS 3 are responsible for the majority of COACH syndrome, with minor contributions from CC 2 D 2 A and RPGRIP 1 L; therefore, MKS 3 should be the first gene tested in patients with JSRD plus liver disease and/or coloboma, followed by CC 2 D 2 A and RPGRIP 1 L. ...|$|E
40|$|Clinical defectological {{diagnostics}}, {{related to}} diagnostics of each individual's impairment of his cognitive and socializing abilities, {{has been applied}} in our country for a long time. Since {{it is a new}} area in the clinical defectological work and a new form of research in defectology, it poses a series of problems which have not been met so far. We shall to recognize some of them in this paper and to aim at their solution. This time we shall consider only the most prominent problems towards which we direct our interventions:· When does defectological diagnostics take part in diagnosis as treatment of impairments of the handicapped person? When does it function in the process of rehabilitation? For example, is working with a dyslexic child treatment or rehabilitation?· When does the early diagnostics reveal a problem arising from inappropriate intersection of different development courses, which can sometimes be solved without any particular treatment (early stuttering, various convulsions), and when does it reveal actual condition, such as <b>oligophrenia</b> or autism. Thereby we ask ourselves if early stimulative treatment of oligophrenic children or children with early childhood psychosis is treatment or rehabilitation. We tried to classify end explain the problems of diagnostics in the context of treatment and rehabilitation and to define the theoretical grounds for our standpoints. We wanted to point out the unity of the process of any impairment of the handicapped person from early childhood {{to the end of his}} life. Treatment and rehabilitation should be a united process and follow the course of development of early disorders which sometimes end up as handicaps, and sometimes, thanks to the treatment, may end up in successful socialization, for example, persons with impaired hearing or sight. We establish defectology as a complete theoretical standpoint and expert procedure which is parallel to and complementary with medicine. The only difference we find is that physicians and clinical psychologists insist on recovering to normal the diseased or impaired functions and structures, while defectology develops methods by which treatment continues even though medical techniques have finished their work. Medicine improves in saving lives and defectology in saving the quality of those saved lives...|$|E
40|$|The ciliopathies, a {{collective}} of diseases caused by dysfunction {{of the primary}} cilia, {{have proven to be}} one of the most exciting groups of new diseases of the last ten years. Joubert syndrome (JBS), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder described for the first time in 1969, has turned out {{to be one of the}} quintessential ciliopathies. JBS shows the wide range of clinical features and genetic heterogeneity typical of the ciliary diseases. Our knowledge on the syndrome has expanded considerably over the last twenty years (for a general overview, I also refer to some of the excellent reviews 1 - 6). However, many questions on the phenotypical variability and the complex genetic background of JBS have not been answered yet. The literature on JBS started with the report of Marie Joubert et al. in 1969 7. She described four siblings with hyperventilation, abnormal eye movements and psychomotor retardation. Boltshauser described the first European cases 8; this is why JBS is also known as Joubert-Boltshauser syndrome. In the initial reports hallmarks of the syndrome were considered to be mental (and motor) retardation, hypotonia, and, specifically, periodic hyperpnea, abnormal eye movements, and vermis aplasia. Several authors recognized the overlap of clinical features with other syndromes (e. g. with orofacialdigital syndrome type 1 9, or CHARGE syndrome 10). In the years following the initial descriptions, many reports have been published adding additional symptoms to the phenotype. For instance, retinal colobomas as part of the Joubert phenotype were reported by Lindhout et al. (1980) 11, and Aicardi et al. (1983) 12, and polydactyly by Egger et al. (1982) 13. The first reports on retinal dysplasia/Lebers congenital amaurosis were in the early eighties of the last century 12, 14, 15, and in the nineties cystic kidney disease and hepatic fibrosis were recognized as features of JBS 16. Over the years, lumpers and splitters have defined the shifting boundaries between JBS and syndromes with overlapping symptoms, e. g. COACH syndrome (cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, <b>oligophrenia,</b> congenital ataxia, coloboma, and hepatic fibrosis 17), and ARIMA syndrome (cerebellar hypoplasia, retinal disease and cystic kidney disease) 18. The term “Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) ” was coined to cope with this ongoing debate. Little has been published on JBS in the Netherlands, since the description of the first case in 1980 1 At the start of this study, we aimed to obtain an overview of the Dutch population of JBS patients, to estimate the Dutch birth prevalence, and to gain insight into the clinical course and genetic background of Dutch JBS cases. This thesis describes the results of our efforts to solve these questions, and related topics that we encountered on the way. Chapters 2 and 3 are focused on clinical aspects of JBS. In Chapter 2 we investigated hearing loss in the Dutch JBS patient cohort. Many studies have addressed the visual features of JBS, but none have investigated hearing. Hearing loss has been reported in some ciliopathies, e. g. Alstrom disease and BBS. Given the fact that many JBS patients have reduced vision and impaired speech development, adequate hearing is extremely important. In Chapter 3 we discuss the diagnostic pitfalls in JBS, especially the correct interpretation of MRI results when evaluating the molar tooth sign. Two patients are described with an initial diagnosis of JBS, who turned out to have chromosomal rearrangements not related to JBS. In Chapter 4 we report a family with a JBS-like phenotype with a pedigree in line with X-linked inheritance. We were especially interested in this family because of the excess of male patients in the Dutch JBS population and our expectation to find involvement of X-linked genes. Chapters 5 to 7 describe the results of molecular studies in the Dutch JBS cohort. In Chapter 5, we investigated the AHI 1 gene, the NPHP 1 gene, and the CYCLIN D 1 gene. At the start of this study, Sanger sequencing was the only tool available. At the time AHI 1 and NPHP 1 had just been identified as JBS causing genes. Since large families suitable for linkage analysis or consanguineous families suitable for homozygosity mapping are relatively rare in the Dutch population, we chose a candidate gene approach based on a combination of JBS loci and animal models, and also investigated CYCLIN D 1 as a possible new JBS gene (OMIM # 168461). In Chapter 6 and 7 we utilized the new possibilities of next generation sequencing. We developed a targeted NGS array containing 22 JBS genes and named it the Joubertome. The molecular cause of JBS remains elusive in about half of the cases, and therefor we added around 600 candidate genes selected from the literature and the ciliary proteome database [[URL] The results of the Joubertome analysis and the finding of MKS 1 as a novel gene for JBS are reported in Chapter 6 and 7...|$|E
