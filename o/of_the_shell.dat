5|$|Near {{the hinge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> with extra material gradually being laid {{down along the}} margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell,</b> and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> {{to detonate}} {{may have had}} various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses.

5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss {{on the margin}} of the outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present on the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell.</b> The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E

50|$|Lirae (singular lira) {{are fine}} lines or ridges (much finer than ribs) {{that are a}} sculptural feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> various animals. <b>The</b> term is {{commonly}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> molluscs such as gastropods, bivalves and nautiloids.

5|$|Generally the whorls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> {{increase}} rather {{regularly in}} size, however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite {{different degrees of}} whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult size is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult size within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult size that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|Membranophones, {{which produce}} sound by a {{vibrating}} a stretched membrane; {{they may be}} drums (further sorted by the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell),</b> which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but kazoos and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.|$|E

50|$|To prevent <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> from {{collapsing}} at {{the long}} light slots at their apexes, concrete struts were inserted at 10-foot (3 m) intervals.

5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> {{that includes}} {{all of the}} whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates.

The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen.

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with the rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> to the front.

The species was shown in the 1742 Index Testarum Conchyliorum, quae adservantur in Museo Nicolai Gualtieri (List of the shells of shellfish which are preserved in the museum of Niccolò Gualtieri) by Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri. In both books, the morphology of an adult shell was shown from different perspectives.|$|E
