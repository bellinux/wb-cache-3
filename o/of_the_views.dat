5|$|There was an {{important}} link between the Raglan Castle and the surrounding parkland, in particular the Home Park and the Red Deer Park. Historian Robert Liddiard suggests that on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> from the castle at this time, the structured nature of the parks would have contrasted with the wilderness of the mountain peaks framing the scene beyond, making {{an important}} statement about the refinement and cultured nature of the castle lord. In the 15th century there were also extensive orchards and fish ponds surrounding the castle, favourably commented upon by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

5000|$|Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's special {{quality was}} to begin with <b>the</b> <b>view</b> rather than end with it; to train in devotion, compassion, and renunciation, {{perfecting}} the accumulations, and removing obscurations, all within <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view.</b> <b>The</b> practitioner was encouraged to see all these aspects <b>of</b> practice as <b>the</b> very expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> itself.

5|$|Lyons took on {{a number}} of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with Bishop David Greer and Rabbi Stephen Wise to expose {{conditions}} in New York's tenements, dissociated himself from Tammany Hall candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for Leo Frank, and opposed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> of Samuel Gompers. In 1912, Lyons was {{a founding member of the}} Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the Eastern United States that was created despite opposition from the Central Conference of Reform Rabbis. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the Allied victory in World War I) and asked that his contributed funds be donated instead to the Red Cross; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over the overt politicization of the event, and its control by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E
5|$|Nasmyth {{was also}} a highly {{influential}} teacher at the Trustee's Academy in Edinburgh. Among his students were painters who took the landscape tradition into the nineteenth century. They included Andrew Wilson (1780–1840), who would become Master of the Academy in 1818, the watercolourist Hugh William Williams (1773–1829), clergyman and artist John Thompson of Duddingston (1778–1840) and probably the artist that would be most directly influenced by Nasmyth, John Knox (1778–1845). Williams' most famous work are interpretive versions of Greek landscapes, based on sketches taken on his travels there, among them The Temple of Poseidon, Cape Sunium (1828). His close friend John Thompson focused on a dark dramatic version of Scottish landscape, as in his most famous work Fast Castle from Below (1824). Knox directly linked Nasmyth's style with the Romantic literature of Walter Scott. Knox's Landscape with Tourists at Lock Katrine (c. 1820), was a commentary on the tourist trade that {{grew up in the}} Trossachs {{in the aftermath of the}} publication of Scott's poem The Lady of the Lake in 1810. He {{was also a}}mong the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow. Towards the end of his career he undertook panoramic works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> from the top of Ben Lomond, which played a part in opening up the Highlands as a spectacle that would be taken up by artists in the second half of the century.|$|E

25|$|Skeptics like Martin Gardner see {{the science}} in The Urantia Book as clear {{reflections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> that prevailed {{at the time}} the book is said to have originated.

That presentation of post-1955 scientific knowledge is avoided is taken to be evidence it was written by humans and not by celestial beings with superior knowledge.|$|E

25|$|During Dixon's time as Chief Justice, {{the court}} came to adopt several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> that Dixon had {{advanced}} in minority opinions in years prior. In several cases, the court upheld Dixon's interpretation of section 92 (one {{of the most}} troublesome sections of the Constitution), which he regarded as guaranteeing {{a constitutional right to}} engage in interstate trade, subject to reasonable regulation. It also followed Dixon's interpretation of section 90 (which prohibits the states from exacting duties of excise), although both these interpretations were ultimately abandoned many years later.|$|E
25|$|The rough-cut stone castle-like {{main house}} {{is built around}} a main block with a conical-roofed round tower.
