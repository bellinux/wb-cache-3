500|$|During {{her time}} in Egypt, Manning became a {{contributor}} to two Middle East-based literary magazines, [...] "Desert Poets" [...] and [...] "Personal Landscapes", founded by Bernard Spencer, Lawrence Durrell, and Robin Fedden. The latter sought to explore the [...] "personal landscapes" [...] of writers experiencing exile during the war. The founders, like Manning, maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt. In remembering the departure from Greece, Manning wrote [...] "We faced the sea / Knowing until the day of <b>our</b> <b>return</b> we would be / Exiles from a country not our own." [...] During their time in Egypt and Palestine, Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers, including translating and editing the work of George Seferis and Elie Papadimitriou. Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in [...] "Poets in Exile" [...] in Cyril Connolly's magazine Horizon. She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were [...] "out of touch", suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures, languages and writers. Her review was much critiqued by those featured, including Durrell who objected to Spencer's poetry being praised at his expense.|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on <b>our</b> <b>return,</b> when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E

2500|$|On 23February, Capt. Thomas Herbert, {{accompanied}} by Charles Elliot, sailed {{to the rear}} passage of Anunghoy Island aboard the Nemesis, with the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, and Alligator in flotilla. They unexpectedly encountered a masked battery, which immediately opened fire on the British ships. Herbert reported that 30 small Chinese junks and boats were [...] "making off in the greatest confusion; <b>our</b> <b>return</b> fire was rapid and so energetically followed up by landing and pushing on to the attack, that the fort ... was immediately in our possession." [...] The Chinese fled after a slight resistance, whereupon their magazines, a few junks, and some boats were burned. The British captured 60 unmounted guns and 20 mounted guns, which they disabled by breaking the trunnions. There were no British casualties. Herbert reported 20 to 30 Chinese dead. On the same day, former Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu wrote in his diary, [...] "I hear that two small steamers belonging to the rebel English, with several small boats, sailed straight up to T'ai-p'ing-hsü [...] in the Bogue, opened fire and set alight a number of peasants' houses, and also the Customs House." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, response to the ode by critics was mostly positive. Andrew Bradley declared in 1909 that [...] "The Immortality Ode, like King Lear, is its author's greatest product, but not his best piece of work." [...] When speaking of Grasmere and Wordsworth, Elias Sneath wrote in 1912: [...] "It witnessed the composition {{of a large number of}} poems, many of which may be regarded among the finest products of his imagination. Most of them have already been considered. However, one remains which, in the judgment of some critics, more than any other poem of the numerous creations of his genius, entitles him to a seat among the Immortals. This is the celebrated ... It is, in some respects, one of his most important works, whether viewed from the stand point of mere art, or from that of poetic insight." [...] George Harper, following Sneath in 1916, described the poem in positive terms and said, [...] "Its radiance comes and goes through a shimmering veil. Yet, when we look close, we find nothing unreal or unfinished. This beauty, though supernal, is not evanescent. It bides <b>our</b> <b>return,</b> and whoever comes to seek it as a little child will find it. The imagery, though changing at every turn, is fresh and simple. The language, though connected with thoughts so serious that they impart to it a classic dignity, is natural and for the most part plain.... Nevertheless, a peculiar glamour surrounds the poem. It is the supreme example of what I may venture to term the romance of philosophic thought." ...|$|E
