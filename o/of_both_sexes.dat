5|$|Orangutans live a more solitary {{lifestyle}} {{than the}} other great apes. Most social bonds occur between adult females and their dependent and weaned offspring. Adult males and independent adolescents <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sexes</b> tend to live alone. Orangutan societies {{are made up of}} resident and transient individuals <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sexes.</b> Resident females live with their offspring in defined home ranges that overlap with those of other adult females, which may be their immediate relatives. One to several resident female home ranges are encompassed within the home range of a resident male, who is their main mating partner.|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} a new X-linked gene, sdc- 2, that controls the hermaphrodite (XX) modes <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> determination and X chromosome dosage compensation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in sdc- 2 cause phenotypes that appear to result from a shift <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the <b>sex</b> determination and dosage compensation processes in XX animals to the XO modes of expression. Twenty-eight independent sdc- 2 mutations have no apparent effect in XO animals, but cause two distinct phenotypes in XX animals: masculinization, reflecting a defect in sex determination, and lethality or dumpiness, reflecting a disruption in dosage compensation. The dosage compensation defect can be demonstrated directly by showing that sdc- 2 mutations cause elevated levels of several X-linked transcripts in XX but not XO animals. While the masculinization is blocked by mutations in sex determining genes required for male development (her- 1 and fem- 3), the lethality, dumpiness and overexpression of X-linked genes are not, indicating {{that the effect of}} sdc- 2 mutations on sex determination and dosage compensation are ultimately implemented by two independent pathways. We propose a model in which sdc- 2 is involved in the coordinate control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> determination and dosage compensation in XX animals and acts in the regulatory hierarchy at a step prior to the divergence of the two pathways...|$|R

5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sexes</b> defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, {{and will not}} let go easily.|$|E
5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sexes</b> form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In Mormidea paupercula (n = 6 + XY in males), the {{presence}} of a CMA 3 -bright band in the telomeric regions on <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes allowed the analysis of the kinetic activity of the sex univalents and XY pseudobivalent at the first and second meiotic divisions, respectively. The separation of the sister chromatids of the sex chromosomes occurs from a pair of telomeric regions (with or without a band), with opposite telomeric regions remaining associated with each other at meiosis I; the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes differs, on the X chromosome both telomeric regions are similarly active, while on the Y chromosome the telomeric region without a band is more frequently active. At the second division, the most frequent associations in the pseudobivalent occur between the telomeric regions <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes with bands or without bands. Therefore, in both meiotic divisions, the same telomeric region on the sex chromosomes could lead the migration, in contrast to that observed usually in autosomal bivalents. These results provide evidence that the sex chromosomes of Heteroptera show more than one pattern of attachment to the spindle...|$|R

5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs.

To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
