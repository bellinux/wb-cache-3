5|$|Cary Joji Fukunaga was {{appointed}} {{as director of}} True Detective first season. He competed with Alejandro González Iñárritu for the role, but Iñárritu dropped <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> other film commitments. To prepare, Fukunaga conducted research with a real-life homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division. The director brought on Adam Arkapaw as the project cinematographer, and hired Alex DiGerlando, who he worked with on Benh Zeitlin's Glory at Sea (2008), as the production designer.|$|E
5|$|For Arsenal, Thierry Henry was {{declared}} fit {{to start and}} played alongside Dennis Bergkamp up front. 17-year-old Cesc Fàbregas partnered Gilberto Silva in central midfield, with José Antonio Reyes and Jermaine Pennant providing width on either side. Manchester United were without seven of their first-team players, including Ruud van Nistelrooy, who required surgery on his hernia. Wes Brown and Louis Saha were also ruled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> injury, so David Bellion and Eric Djemba-Djemba came into the first team.|$|E

The main games have become noted for their dark storylines and mixture of ground-based and aerial combat, while Nier stood <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its mixture of gameplay styles. The series has received mixed to positive reception in both Japan and the West: the majority of praise has been given to its story and characters, while the gameplay has come in for criticisms for being repetitive or poorly designed.|$|E

Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Don Felipe returned to his profession.|$|E
5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E
5|$|Despite the club's relegation to League One {{and another}} spell in administration, Wetherall {{turned down a}} move away from Bradford City after {{snubbing}} Coventry City during the 2004 summer. In October 2004, Wetherall and fellow veteran player Dean Windass both signed year's extensions to their contracts, with Wetherall's keeping him at Bradford {{until the end of}} the 2007–08 season. He also put his injury problems to one side for the 2004–05 season and missed just one league game – a 1–1 draw with Walsall in February when he was ruled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> suspension ending his run of 42 consecutive games. Bradford manager Colin Todd had identified Wetherall as a key player for the season, but despite scoring four goals and striker Windass' 27 goals earning him the league's top scorer's crown, Bradford could only finish 11th.|$|E

5|$|Growing up in Ohio, Gillom {{played for}} Brown on the {{football}} team at Massillon Washington High School, where he excelled as an end, linebacker and punter. In Gillom's three seasons between 1938 and 1940, Massillon won all of its games and captured two High School Football National Championships. Gillom followed Brown to Ohio State University in 1941, playing on the school's freshman football team before dropping <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> poor grades. He then entered the U.S. Army and served for three years in World War II. Upon his discharge, Gillom enrolled at the University of Nevada, Reno to finish his college career. He led the country in scoring in 1946 but left the school after the season, again because of poor grades.|$|E
5|$|Hawaii's {{geographical}} isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a {{large number}} of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped <b>out.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpine–subalpine, montane, and basal forest.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

5|$|Merckx {{looked to}} be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, {{becoming}} the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so. In 1980, Hinault was going for a third consecutive win, but had to pull <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk. Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race {{as well as the}} one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.|$|E

The project initially had four options: a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design without modification, a MOTS design modified for Australian conditions, an evolution of an existing submarine, or a newly designed submarine. Nuclear propulsion was ruled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the lack of nuclear infrastructure and public opposition to nuclear technology. Designs initially considered for purchase or modification included the Spanish S-80 class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the German-designed Type 214, and Japan's Sōryū class, along with an evolution of the Collins.|$|E

As with the four other temporary Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. As it turned out, no enemy action took place in the area, and all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The temporary bridge was dismantled in 1945.|$|E

Verbinski dropped <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> DiCaprio's {{commitment}} on Gangs of New York. Lasse Hallström was {{in negotiations}} to direct by May 2001, but dropped out in July 2001. At this stage Harris and Sevigny left the film, but Gandolfini was still attached. Spielberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, offered {{the job of}} director to Miloš Forman, and considered hiring Cameron Crowe. During this negotiation period, Spielberg began to consider directing the film himself, eventually dropping projects such as Big Fish and Memoirs of a Geisha. Spielberg officially committed to directing in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|British {{producer}} Elizabeth Karlsen of Number 9 Films {{came across}} Nagy's script circa 2004, {{during which she}} co-produced Nagy's film Mrs. Harris with Christine Vachon of New York-based Killer Films. Berwin's rights to The Price of Salt expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights to her, closing down the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a U.K. director who then dropped <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the film's lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. Carol was scheduled to commence photography in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Christine Vachon to discuss losing another director and Vachon told her that Haynes' new film {{was not going to}} happen because its star had backed out of it. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes' frequent collaborator, asked him if he would be interested and he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct and Vachon joined the film as a producer. Haynes was announced {{as the director of the}} film in May 2013. Two days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E

Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, {{in order to make it}} look like she is still addicted to painkillers. Tom catches Sienna trying to breast feed Oscar, although Sienna accuses Tom of trying to take topless pictures of her. Darren believes Sienna's lies that Nancy is still a painkiller addict, resulting in Nancy moving out and Darren and Sienna beginning a relationship. Sienna begins faking a pregnancy although is devastated when she overhears Darren saying he doesn't want the baby. In order to get Darren closer, Sienna attempts to officially get rid of Nancy and she frames Nancy for trying to kill Oscar, Charlie and herself. Nancy is taken to a mental institute because of this.

Tom realizes what Sienna has done to Nancy and attempts to expose her by putting a video camera in her bedroom. Darren finds the video camera, however, and assumes that Tom had been trying to film Sienna topless again leaving Darren furious with Tom. Darren later makes up with Jack when he is nearly killed in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. A man with an American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{last game}} of the Browns' regular season was a 66–14 win over the Dodgers. Nine {{different}} Cleveland players scored touchdowns in the game. The Browns' point total set an AAFC scoring record. Groza kicked a field goal to reach 13 for the season, exceeding Driscoll's all-time record. He also kicked four extra points, bringing his total for the season to 45 and beating the previous professional record of 42. Groza, however, injured his left ankle {{in the third quarter}} while making a tackle and had to be carried off the field. Substituting for Groza, Chet Adams kicked through five more extra points. Otto Graham played {{less than half of the}} game as Cleveland built a large lead, and Cliff Lewis and Bud Schwenk substituted for him in the second half. The Browns ended the game with several injured players at key positions. In addition to Groza, halfbacks Ray Terrell, Don Greenwood and Al Akins had to sit <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> injuries.
