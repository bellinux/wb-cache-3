5|$|After a 40-day delay {{caused by}} faulty {{computer}} chips, Kvant-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's solar array {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special backpack unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's airlock.|$|E

In one event, several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels. Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle.

He was part of Port Adelaide's un{{defeated}} 1914 team that held North Adelaide to a single goal in the 1914 SAFL Grand Final and defeated VFL premiers Carlton in the 1914 Championship of Australia match at the Adelaide Oval. A game played between Port Adelaide and a composite team of the best SAFL players {{was held in the}} post season with Port Adelaide coming out as the victors with Harold Oliver awarded the best <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> with arguably the best players of the competition taking to the field on that day.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Hall {{was among}} the best {{on the ground in}} an interstate match between the VFL and the SANFL, {{finished}} in third in the Devils' best and fairest count, and was runner up in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award. The 2006 season saw Hall named best <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> in his 100th VFL match, a 24-point win over Frankston. He was again runner up in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and also finished as runner up in the team's best and fairest count. In 2007 journalist Matt Burgan, writing for the AFL website, named Hall in his best 22 players currently from Tasmania, with Hall and Cameron Thurley the only two players who were not listed with an AFL club at the time of selection. Hall was named in the Devils' leadership group {{at the beginning of the}} 2007 season. He represented Tasmania in an interstate match against Queensland and was awarded the Lefroy Medal as best <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> for the Tasmanians. Hall finished the year winning his first Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and coming third in the best and fairest.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E

5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} of {{warships}} also, {{some of the most}} recent ironclads such as the Kōtetsu coexisted with older types of steamboats and even traditional sailboats. The Shogunate initially had a rather strong edge in warships, and it had the vision to order the state-of-the-art French-made Kotetsu, although the ship was blocked from delivery by foreign powers <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> of neutrality once the conflict had started, and was ultimately remitted to the Imperial faction shortly after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{caused the}} South Melbourne {{coaching}} staff concern when he fractured two fingers in a match against Hawthorn {{two weeks before}} the final series.

In the Grand Final Nash played at centre-half-back, took thirteen marks and had twenty-nine kicks and dominated play.|$|E

Davis in high school was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It {{was the first time}} the A’s had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. Joust 2 introduced a transformation ability that morphs the player's bird into a pegasus, which provides better offensive capabilities while <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> but poor flight capabilities. A second player can join the game. The two players can either cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open.

It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} agreed in December 1974, the talks between the Rhodesian {{government}} and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen {{to adhere to the}} accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government, placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, {{on the opposite side of}} the carriage, would be able to attend without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975.|$|E
5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three {{sections}} {{that are not}} are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and {{the northern end of}} the line from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride <b>on</b> <b>ground</b> level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a new test track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E
