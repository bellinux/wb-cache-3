This study also evaluates actual profit effects 1 year after start-up. We find that on average women invest less time in the business than men.

We can compute a money metric of these utility differences from the mean effect <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>income</b> on utility. This values the loss in welfare from moving from labour force non-participation to lower part time at £ 20.56 (i.e. 0.92 / 0.0447) {{with a standard deviation}} of 5.14; and to higher part time at £ 23.69 (1.56); and to full time at £ 28.38 (4.47). The results suggest that the canonical economic model of labour supply is supported by the data: there is a utility gain from income and a utility loss from working that increases with hours of work – there is nothing in the econometric model that imposes such results.|$|E

Following the massive war-related emigration of the 1980 's, remittances became a significant source of household income throughout the 1990 's.

Measuring income from a source that is uncorrelated with parental schooling remittances, we find that remittances have a large, significant effect on school retention. We estimate that while household income net of remittances has a small, though significant, impact on the hazard of leaving school in rural and urban areas, remittances have a much larger impact on the hazard of leaving school.

Revised IAS 1 requires companies to report total comprehensive income that is a sum <b>of</b> net <b>income</b> and <b>other</b> comprehensive <b>income.</b> Total comprehensive income includes all unrealized gains and losses recognized under IFRS. Before the amendment, some of the unrealized gains and losses were shown in a statement of changes in equity but not in the income statement.

40|$|Purpose: Identification {{of methods}} for {{presenting}} the components <b>of</b> <b>other</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> {{in the statement}} of changes in equity in the reporting practices of public companies in Poland and Germany. Methodology: A study of domestic and foreign literature was conducted with analysis of annual reports of public companies. The study followed the method of induction and to analyse the results, the structure similarity index was used. Results: The {{results of the study}} supported conclusions that the companies under study had not  developed a uniform presentation of the components of comprehensive income in their statements of changes in equity. Five options of presenting the components <b>of</b> <b>other</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> in the statement of changes in equity were identified. Companies both from the WIG 30 and DAX  indices most frequently presented the statement of changes in equity in option 1, which consisted of presenting the total comprehensive income item in a row and detailed items of equity in columns in which capital gains and losses were recognized. The differentiated forms of presenting the components of comprehensive income made it difficult to compare financial statements. Scope of research: The survey examined the annual reports of the largest Polish and German public companies respectively from the WIG 30 and DAX indices. The components <b>of</b> <b>other</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> presented in the statements of changes in equity were the main subject of the study. Originality: Comparative studies on the presentation of the components <b>of</b> <b>other</b> comprehensive <b>income</b> in the statement of changes in equity by public companies in Poland and Germany have not yet been conducted. This was therefore the research gap addressed in this study. ...|$|R
