5|$|In 2005, the 22-officer Dawson Creek Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{municipal}} detachment reported 2,561 Criminal Code <b>offences.</b> This {{translated into}} a crime rate of 225 Criminal Code <b>offences</b> per 1,000 people, down from the previous year's rate of 231, but still {{much higher than the}} provincial average of 125. In 2004, per 1,000 people, the city had higher crime rates compared to the provincial averages on all Criminal Code <b>offences</b> except theft from motor vehicles (19.8 city, 20.2 province), heroin-related <b>offences</b> (0 city, 0.13 province), and murder (0 city, 0.03 province).

Per 1,000 people, the city had much higher levels of shoplifting (13.8 city, 4.2 province), cocaine-related <b>offences</b> (7.8 city, 1.4 province), commercial break-and-enters (11.2 city, 4.2 province), residential break-and-enters (13.9 city, 6.0 province), and non-sexual assaults (26.2 city, 9.9 province).|$|E

For petty <b>offences,</b> a company commander could have men fined or confined to barracks for fatigue duty A battalion Commanding Officer could give detention, order up to 28 days Field Punishment, or demote corporals to the ranks (officers and senior NCOs were {{dealt with by}} court martial other than for very trivial <b>offences).</b> Enlisted men could also lose leave or seniority.|$|E
5|$|According to the report, sex <b>offences</b> were {{committed}} by Savile on 450 people (328 being minors at the time) across England and Scotland, {{and also in}} Jersey. The {{vast majority of the}} alleged <b>offences</b> occurred in his home town of Leeds and his main workplace in London. The victims were mainly unacquainted with each other. Savile may have committed more than 30 rapes, with a total of 126 claims of indecent acts having been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 600 {{people had}} {{provided}} {{information at the}} time of the report's publication with 450 relating to Savile. This resulted in the formal recording of a total 214 alleged criminal <b>offences</b> across 28 police forces. No attacks within the West Mercia area are included in the figures, and Gray expected the number of recorded <b>offences</b> to rise above the 214 considered by the report.|$|E
5|$|Certain things {{cannot be}} attempted. These include conspiracy, under section 1(4) of the 1981 Act, {{assisting}} a criminal, under section 4(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967, aiding {{in the commission}} of an offence, or most summary <b>offences,</b> with the logic being that they are too minor for attempts to justify a criminal conviction. A small number of separate statutory <b>offences</b> have been created to cover attempts concerning individual summary <b>offences,</b> in which case, usual attempt law and procedure applies.|$|E

50|$|If a peace {{officer is}} {{satisfied}} on reasonable grounds that an arrest {{is not necessary}} to establish the identity of the person, secure or preserve evidence, or prevent the continuation of the <b>offence</b> or the commission of another <b>offence,</b> they can issue the person an appearance notice instead of arresting them, provided that the <b>offence</b> is a summary conviction <b>offence,</b> a hybrid <b>offence,</b> or an <b>offence</b> within the absolute jurisdiction of a judge of a provincial court.|$|R
5000|$|Mens rea {{needs to}} be proved by {{prosecution}} from <b>offence</b> to <b>offence.</b> If {{it is a common}} law <b>offence,</b> mens rea is found out by relevant precedent (DPP v Morgan 1976 AC 182).

5|$|Details of {{previous}} criminal convictions {{of some of}} the accused were not published during the trial to avoid harming legal defences in Indonesia. Once the Denpasar District court reached guilty verdicts and issued sentences it was reported in the Australian media that members of the group had been convicted of <b>offences</b> in Australia before their arrests in Indonesia. In December 2004 Rush pleaded guilty at the Inala Magistrates' Court in Queensland to 16 <b>offences</b> including drug possession, fraud, theft and drunk-driving. A warrant for his arrest in Australia remains in place over the theft of $A4,797 from the Commonwealth Bank via a forged cheque.

5|$|Section 4 of the 1971 Act {{sets out}} that <b>offences</b> under {{sections}} 1(2) and 1(3) are punishable by a maximum {{term of life}} imprisonment and all others by a maximum of ten years' imprisonment.

5|$|Students earn demerit {{points for}} poor behaviour. Accumulated demerit points can affect final grades and {{eligibility}} for certain awards, scholarships and overseas trips. The student handbook states that, for serious <b>offences,</b> male students at Hwa Chong Institution may be punished with detention, suspension, caning or expulsion. Only the Principal or Discipline Master may administer corporal punishment, {{which consists of}} a maximum of five strokes of the cane. Students found smoking are immediately caned or suspended or both. Caning may also be given for integrity-related <b>offences</b> (e.g. cheating), uncivilized behaviour (e.g. defiance), and criminal <b>offences</b> (e.g. fighting).|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the new {{legislative}} changes interfered in matter of the second <b>offence,</b> regulated in the current Criminal Code in the stipulations of art. 37 - 39; art. 402, but also by the new Criminal Code in the stipulations of art. 41 - 43; art. 146 we identify the theoretical-practical sizes of this juridical-criminal category. The study is determined by the necessity to improve the national legislation regarding the regulation of the second <b>offence</b> in the conditions of the existent tendencies in the international criminal policy and in the activity of combating the phenomenon of the second <b>offence</b> in other countries. The stipulations of the Romanian Criminal Code, regarding the second <b>offence,</b> should be improved by clearly specifying the ways of the second <b>offence,</b> the materialization of the existence conditions of the second <b>offence,</b> not only for the natural person, but also for the juridical entity, of the individualization of the punishment in case of second <b>offence,</b> as there are cases generating difficulties in the judicial practice.

5|$|The {{common law}} offence of inciting the {{commission}} of another offence was abolished on 1 October 2008, except in relation to <b>offences</b> committed wholly or partly before that date. However, the language of incitement is retained in other statutory <b>offences,</b> such as inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity contrary to section 8 of the Sexual <b>Offences</b> Act 2003. The same rules are applied in these cases as the existing body of law on incitement.|$|E
5|$|The modern law of {{criminal}} damage is mostly {{contained in the}} Criminal Damage Act 1971, which redefines or creates several <b>offences</b> protecting property rights. The Act provides a comprehensive structure covering merely preparatory acts to the most serious <b>offences</b> of arson and causing damage with intent to endanger life. As such, punishments vary from a fixed penalty to life imprisonment, and the court may order payment of compensation to a victim.|$|E
