5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister <b>of</b> <b>Justice</b> Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution.

This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister <b>of</b> <b>Justice,</b> which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
