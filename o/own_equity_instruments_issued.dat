40|$|Description of Transaction/Event 1. An entity may <b>issue</b> its <b>own</b> <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> (e. g. shares) as {{purchase}} consideration when acquiring an asset. Paragraph 6. 1 of Accounting Standards AASB 1015 and AAS 21 “Acquisitions of Assets ” requires an acquisition {{to be measured}} at {{the cost to the}} acquiring entity. In determining the cost of acquisition, the Standards require <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued</b> by the acquirer to be measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition. 2. Both AASB 1015 and AAS 21 require that, where an entity or operation is acquired, any difference between the cost of acquisition and the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (less, where applicable, the aggregate fair value of the identifiable liabilities assumed) must be accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards AASB 1013 and AAS 18 “Accounting for Goodwill”. 3. The determination of the fair value of <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued</b> in an acquisition and, therefore, the {{purchase consideration}}, has a direct effect on the calculation of any goodwill or discount on acquisition, where an entity or business operation is acquired. 4. Current Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements provide limited guidance on the factors that should be taken into account in determining the fair value of <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> which are <b>issued</b> as purchase consideration, particularly those that are not traded in an active and liquid market. 5. Concern has been expressed that, in the absence of authoritative guidance, diverse or unacceptable accounting practices may be applied in determining the fair value of <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued</b> as purchase consideration (and thus the amount of goodwill or discount on acquisition), and that this will undermine the relevance and reliability of general purpose financial reports...|$|R
40|$|Statement 123 {{establishes}} the measurement principles for transactions in which <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> are <b>issued</b> {{in exchange for}} the receipt of goods or services. Paragraph 8 of Statement 123 states that those transactions should be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued,</b> whichever is more reliably measurable. Statement 123 does not, however, prescribe the measurement date or provide guidance on recognition of the cost of those transactions. Also, it does not address the accounting for <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued</b> in conjunction with selling goods or services, such as a sales incentive. The FASB staff observes, however, that sales incentives in the form of <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> should be measured at the fair value of the sales incentive or the fair value of the <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued,</b> whichever is more reliably measurable.

40|$|M. Comm. (International Accounting) The study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} effect of applying a fair value model after the grant date to employee share options. The research assesses {{the appropriateness of}} the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment transactions with a specific focus on equity-settled Employee Share Options. The researcher has calculated the percentage movements or changes of fair value between each financial year including the overall percentage change. The study was mainly triggered by the IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment rules and various arguments from different authors challenging the appropriateness of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment on employee share options (ESOs) transactions in capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder at exercise date when applying a grant date accounting model. The study provides insights into whether a grant date accounting model is appropriate in measuring ESOs and capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder. The application of a static fair value model in measuring the value of ESOs has the potential for both positive and negative effects on the compensation cost recognised in the financial statements over the vesting period. After analysing the descriptive financial data on fair value per option over the six year period included in the sample selection, a conclusion was reached that, IASB should consider to true-up or make a restatement of the opening balance of the fair value reserves account in order to minimise the potential permanent error in equity accounts and to minimise the potential effect of understating or overstating the compensation cost. The IASB should further consider the proper classification of <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>issued</b> to employee ESOs which comply with other financial instrument accounting standards such as the IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This will ensure that transactions viewed as economic equivalents of each other are treated in the same way from an accounting perspective, and the correct measurement basis of ESOs may be achieved...|$|R

40|$|The Brazilian {{preference}} shares, in general, {{except when}} they present specific features, such as mandatory redemption and cumulative dividends, meet the accounting definition of <b>equity</b> <b>instruments.</b> However, {{the scientific literature}} believes that those shares {{that do not have}} discretion to avoid the delivery of cash must be classified as financial liabilities. In a context in which remain differences of understanding of their proper accounting treatment, the following question arises: preferred shares of Brazilian companies are being recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the theoretical and normative precepts? Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} verify if the preference shares of Brazilian companies have been recognized in the financial statements for according to the scientific literature and accounting standards. Through content analysis, we analyzed the information of 157 companies listed on BM&FBOVESPA. The results show that 155 companies classify its preference shares as <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> and two as financial liabilities. These two companies, as well as 149 of those which qualify as <b>equity</b> <b>instruments,</b> are treating them properly in its accounting. The other six companies should present its preference shares as liabilities, given the absence of discretion to avoid cash delivery, feature present in financial liabilities, unlike <b>equity</b> <b>instruments.</b> It is noticed that, unlike what happens, for instance, in the US market, it is not possible to classify all Brazilian preference shares as a financial liability, since, in Brazil, they are used in different legal format of those widely found in that market. Moreover, almost all of the analyzed shares have essential features for classification as <b>equity</b> <b>instruments.</b> Hence, the importance of analysis of the economic essence of each instrument, thus, enabling the appropriate accounting treatment in the financial statements...|$|R

40|$|IFRS 13, {{adopted in}} 2013, {{introduced}} a general framework for fair value valuation of unquoted <b>equity</b> <b>instruments.</b> It {{has to be}} performed {{in line with the}} “highest and best use” concept and in the conditions of potential transactions carried out on “the most advantageous market”. This article presents a new and comprehensive approach to the valuation process of such instruments, which meets these IFRS 13 requirements. This approach applies a concept of the most advantageous market discount (MAMD), based on the well-known underpricing phenomenon. The application of this discount along with the Markowitz theory results in a cohesive, comprehensive and practical framework for unquoted <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> valuation according to the fair value concept compliant with IFRS 13. Additionally, this paper presents estimations of MAMD for the UK, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Poland. The obtained results can help valuation practitioners apply the MAMD concept in the process of unquoted <b>equity</b> <b>instruments</b> valuation according to IFRS 13. Compared to other approaches which address the issue of private company valuation, the presented valuation framework for the first time reconciles the requirements set in IFRS 13 fair value definition with the assumption of valuation in the reality of imperfect markets. ...|$|R
