5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff {{is not limited to the}} lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.|$|E

5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} bodies <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan. In {{as little as}} 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They {{are believed to have}} been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into {{the importance of the}} shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E

However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
