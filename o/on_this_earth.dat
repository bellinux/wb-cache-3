5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>Earth</b> are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

25|$|In Sikh thought, Hell and Heaven are not {{places for}} living hereafter, {{they are part}} of spiritual {{topography}} of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence. For example, Guru Arjan explains that people who are entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>Earth</b> i.e. their life is hellish.|$|E

25|$|The {{account is}} also an eschatology: the divine revelation {{concerns}} {{the end of the}} present age, a moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom. The Book of Daniel gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth,</b> that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and on those Jews who cooperated with them.|$|E
25|$|The School of the Prophets {{spoken of}} in the book Under the Banner of Heaven claims revelation showing that Young was {{inaccurate}} in some points of his Adam–God teachings, but otherwise he was correct. The understanding from these revelations is that Jesus was the Only Begotten Son in {{the flesh of the}} Savior of the previous Earth where the father of all Spirits, Michael/Adam, had his mortal probation. The lineage of Michael/Adam, which includes all but Jesus <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>Earth,</b> will never become saviors of worlds. Thus the Adam–God doctrine of Young is simply a fuller understanding of the New Testament doctrine of joint-heirs with Christ.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} many of the fathers, Irenaeus did not {{distinguish}} between the new earth re-created in its eternal state—the thousand years of Revelation 20—when the saints are with Christ after His second advent, and the Jewish traditions of the Messianic kingdom. Hence, he applies Biblical and traditional ideas to his descriptions of this earth during the millennium, throughout the closing chapters of Book 5. This conception of the reign of resurrected and translated saints with Christ <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> during the millennium-popularly known as chiliasm—was the increasingly prevailing belief of this time. Incipient distortions due to the admixture of current traditions, which figure in the extreme forms of chiliasm, caused a reaction against the earlier interpretations of Bible prophecies.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Fadlan {{reports that}} the {{settlement}} of disputes in Khazaria was adjudicated by judges hailing each from his community, be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or Pagan. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} Khazar king saw himself as a defender of Jews even beyond the kingdom's frontiers, retaliating against Muslim or Christian interests in Khazaria in the wake of Islamic and Byzantine persecutions of Jews abroad. Ibn Fadlan recounts specifically an incident in which the king of Khazaria destroyed the minaret of a mosque in Atil as revenge for the destruction of a synagogue in Dâr al-Bâbûnaj, and allegedly said he would have done worse were it not for a fear that the Muslims might retaliate in turn against Jews. Ḥasdai ibn Shaprūṭ sought information on Khazaria in the hope he might discover 'a place <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> where harassed Israel can rule itself' and wrote that, were it to prove true that Khazaria had such a king, he would not hesitate to forsake his high office and his family in order to emigrate there.|$|E

[...] It {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist, {{who wants to}} make her mark <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>Earth</b> before her time is up as she wants that the world remember her impact. Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk elaborated on the song's composition: [...] "'I Was Here' is Beyoncé's monument to the ages. The song climbs higher and higher, chorus by chorus, until Beyoncé reaches her apex, delivering some of her best vocals on the album. The lyrics are a bit uninspired, overly triumphant but somewhat humble as the singer contemplates her mark on history. Although she has garnered massive amounts of acclaim through her storied career, Beyoncé is far from satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recovering}} from a life-threatening illness in which surgeons removed 95 percent of his stomach, Kizirian entered {{a career in the}} Postal Service. He first returned to the Providence post office as a substitute clerk. In 1954, he was appointed foreman, the first of several promotions he received throughout his life. In 1961, he was made Postmaster of Providence by President John F. Kennedy. Congress unanimously confirmed the appointment. At age 36, Kizirian was one of the youngest postmasters in the country. During his tenure, Kizirian was instrumental in establishing the first automated post office. The Providence post office would be an exemplary model for post offices around the world. Kizirian later remarked, [...] "There is no nation <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> that didn't send representatives to see the new post office." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "We may be grateful to Providence" [...] that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had [...] "spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won". Truman then warned Japan: [...] "If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth.</b> Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware."

[...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson.

I've come {{to think that the}} reason we're put <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> is to procreate. To leave something behind. Not films, because you know that I don't think my films will last very long once I'm gone. But another human being. That's what's important." [...] Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968. On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine. Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising.|$|E

Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> nude." [...] Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said [...] "I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{press release}} for Voodoo was issued in January, {{discussing}} the album's experimental edge and the anticipation for its release.

[...] A video for [...] "Send It On" [...] included footage from Voodoos supporting tour. A music video for [...] "Left & Right", created by director Malik Hassan Sayeed and producer Rich Ford, Jr., was anticipated by fans and MTV network executives that had planned special promotions and a world premiere for the clip. However, Sayeed's concept of a concert video that paid tribute to funk shows of the past expended Virgin's budget and resulted in a missed deadline for the MTV premiere. As punishment, the network refused to put the final edit of music video in rotation. It was eventually world-premiered by BET on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>Earth.</b> Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E
