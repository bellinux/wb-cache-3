5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavenly abode. The interior panel {{of the door and}} window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between the shutters and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E

This offers the village more sunny days than much of the British Isles, and fewer frosts.|$|E
5|$|Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, also {{supported}} Richard's seizure of {{the throne of}} England. The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance. Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace. Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north. Northumberland was mollified when he was promised {{he would be the}} Warden of the East March, a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys. He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship. However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position. According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated, he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E

30|$|Gender {{differences}} were noted within the regression models {{of wanting to}} marry, {{as well as the}} preferred timing of marriage. Females were more likely to prefer marriage when they had higher levels of self-esteem and more conservative gender attitudes. Understandably, self-esteem may be associated with confidence and comfort <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intimate relationship, while conservative gender attitudes may reflect the traditional cultural expectations for marriage itself.|$|R

The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that approximately {{one third of the}} star systems in the Milky Way are binary or multiple, with the remaining two thirds being single stars.

25|$|GHB {{is often}} taken because users {{find that it}} enhances their {{experiences}} <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> club, party, or rave; small doses of GHB {{can act as a}} stimulant and aphrodisiac.

25|$|In 1739 Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Pé succeeded him as {{superior}} of the Jesuit missions. In September, Lauzon {{resumed his}} missionary labours with the Caughnawaga Iroquois. There, he defended the Indians against charges in France of disloyalty and illicit {{trade with the}} English. In a 1741 report to Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, governor of Trois-Rivières, Lauzon recounted the services the Caughnawaga Iroquois had rendered France against other Indians and the English. He also rejected the accusations of engaging in trade that had been brought against the Jesuits at the mission. These accusations developed into the Tournois-Desauniers affair. The Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Tournois was accused <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> business partnership with the Misses Desauniers and promoting their store among the Indians. On April 12, 1742, the minister, Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas, ordered the store closed and directed Lauzon to take further steps to prevent the Iroquois from going over to the English.|$|E
