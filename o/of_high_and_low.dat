5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

25|$|Oscillating {{currents}} {{produced by}} tides {{are known as}} tidal streams. The moment that the tidal current ceases is called slack water or slack tide. The tide then reverses direction and {{is said to be}} turning. Slack water usually occurs near high water and low water. But there are locations where the moments of slack tide differ significantly from those <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> water.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northern}} hemisphere the jet stream was very disturbed, resulting in a Rossby wave pattern <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> pressure regions. During March the UK was positioned under a strong high pressure region resulting in very dry and warm conditions which brought a heatwave. In April, the wave pattern underwent a significant shift to bring the UK {{under the influence of}} strong low pressure, with prevailing south-westerly flow and heavy rainfall.|$|E
25|$|At {{low latitudes}} the Hadley {{circulation}} dominates, and {{is essentially the}} same as the process which on Earth generates the trade winds. At higher latitudes a series <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> pressure areas, called baroclinic pressure waves, dominate the weather. Mars is drier and colder than Earth, and in consequence dust raised by these winds tends to remain in the atmosphere longer than on Earth as there is no precipitation to wash it out (excepting CO2 snowfall). One such cyclonic storm was recently captured by the Hubble space telescope (pictured below).|$|E

25|$|The {{relief of}} Bulgaria is varied. In the {{relatively}} small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges. The main characteristic of Bulgaria's topography is four alternating bands <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands, called geomorphological regions, are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Transitional region and the Rilo-Rhodope region. The easternmost sections near the Black Sea are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost {{part of the country}} is entirely high ground.|$|E
25|$|Using {{relatively}} recent night light data and electricity consumption {{in comparison with}} Gross County Product, the informal sector of the local economy in Veracruz state is shown to have grown {{during the period of}} the Fox Administration though the regional government remained PRI. The assumption that the informal economy of Mexico is a constant 30% of total economic activity is not supported at the local level. The small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> literacy rates amongst municipios in Veracruz but not enough to warrant including an I-statistic as a regressor. Global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study.|$|E
25|$|Though its exact {{parameters}} remain debatable, {{from the}} early 1970s {{to the present day}} the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism. Thomas Pynchon, a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction, ideogrammatic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms, a strong focus on postcolonial themes, and a subversive commingling <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> culture. In 1973, he published Gravity's Rainbow, a leading work in this genre, which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. His other major works include his debut, V. (1963), The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Mason & Dixon (1997), and Against the Day (2006).|$|E

25|$|Black bears also rely on salmon as food. The {{leftovers}} {{the bears}} leave behind are considered important nutrients for the Canadian forest, {{such as the}} soil, trees, and plants. In this sense, the salmon feed the forest and in return receive clean water and gravel in which to hatch and grow, sheltered from extremes of temperature and water flow in times <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> rainfall. However, {{the condition of the}} salmon in Haida has been affected in recent decades. Due to logging and development, much of the salmon's habitat (i.e., Ain River) has been destroyed, resulting in the fish being close to endangered. For residents, this has resulted in limits on catches, in turn, has affected families diets, and cultural events such as feasts. Some of the salmon systems in danger include: the Davidon, Naden, Mamim, and Mathers. It is clear that further protection is needed for salmon, such as their habitats, where logging commonly occurs.|$|E
25|$|The NEP is also criticised for {{not dealing}} {{directly}} {{with issues of}} wealth distribution and economic inequality; {{that it no longer}} helps the poor but is instead an institutionalised system of handouts for the largest ethnic community in Malaysia as the NEP does not discriminate based on economic class. Bumiputras <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> economic standing are entitled to the same benefits. The statistical problems of categorising wealthy and disadvantaged Bumiputras in one group also meant that the NEP's goal of having 30% of the national wealth held by Bumiputras was not indicative of a median 60% of Bumiputras holding 28% of the national wealth, but could theoretically translate into one Bumiputra holding 29% of the national wealth, with the remaining Bumiputras sharing 1%. Some have alleged that because of this imbalance, some Malays remain economically marginalised. Criticisms also arose from {{the fact that there was}} no planned assistance for Malaysian Chinese and Indian communities to achieve their 40% goal during the actual implementation of the NEP.|$|E
25|$|Barometric {{pressure}} and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} weather forecasting since the late 19th century. When used in combination with wind observations, reasonably accurate short-term forecasts can be made. Simultaneous barometric readings from across a network of weather stations allow maps of air pressure to be produced, which were the first form of the modern weather map when created in the 19th century. Isobars, lines of equal pressure, when drawn on such a map, give a contour map showing areas <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> pressure. Localized high atmospheric pressure acts as a barrier to approaching weather systems, diverting their course. Atmospheric lift caused by low-level wind convergence into the surface brings clouds and sometimes precipitation. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than 3.5hPa (0.1 inHg), the greater the change in weather that can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises, such as {{in the wake of a}} cold front, are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of postmodern art is its conflation <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> culture {{through the use}} of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik's 1990–91 show High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art at New York's Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. Postmodern art is noted for {{the way in which it}} blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.|$|E
25|$|Having {{come to her}} {{literary}} maturity at a {{time when}} the ubiquitous and unvarying stated defence of the novel was its educative power, Maria Edgeworth was among the few authors who truly espoused the educator's role. Her novels are morally and socially didactic in the extreme. A close analysis of the alterations which Edgeworth's style underwent when it was pressed into the service of overt didacticism should serve to illuminate the relationship between prose technique and didactic purpose in her work. The convention which Maria Edgeworth has adopted and worked to death is basic to the eighteenth-century novel, but its roots lie in the drama, tracing at least to the Renaissance separation <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> characters by their forms of speech. Throughout the eighteenth-century drama, and most noticeably in the sentimental comedy, the separation becomes more and more a means of moral judgment as well as social identification. The only coherent reason for Edgeworth's acceptance is the appeal of didactic moralism. In the first place, she is willing to suspend judgment wherever the service of the moral is the result. Everything else may go, so long as the lesson is enforced. the lesson might be a warning against moral impropriety, as in Miss Milner's story, or against social injustice, as in The Absentee. Furthermore, the whole reliance on positive exemplars had been justified long before by Steele, who argued that the stage must supply perfect heroes since its examples are imitated and since simple natures are incapable of making the necessary deductions from the negative exemplars of satire.|$|E

500|$|The {{time of the}} day must be considered, {{as there}} are two natural rises per day (locally around 10am and 10pm) and two natural falls per day (locally around 4am and 4pm).

[...] The lowest natural dip in the pressure, in a stagnant weather pattern, occurs around 4pm while the highest natural peak in pressure occurs around 10am.

500|$|House sparrows {{have also}} been used in studies of nonphotic {{entrainment}} (i.e. synchronisation to an external cycle other than light and dark): for example, in constant darkness, {{a situation in which}} the birds would normally reveal their endogenous, non-24-hour, [...] "free-running" [...] rhythms of activity, they instead show 24-hour periodicity if they are exposed to two hours of chirp playbacks every 24hours, matching their daily activity onsets with the daily playback onsets.

Finally, house sparrows in constant darkness can be entrained to a cycle <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> temperature, but only if the difference between the two temperatures is large (38 versus 6°C); some of the tested sparrows matched their activity to the warm phase, and others to the cold phase.|$|E
