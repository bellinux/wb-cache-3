5|$|A {{deepening}} trough <b>over</b> <b>the</b> eastern United States was forecast to {{turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center of}} circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic and the trough <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeastern United States.|$|E

50|$|To {{obtain the}} normal score curve VJD System {{considers}} {{the percentage of}} runs scored in seven phases: settling down (first 10% of <b>the</b> <b>overs,</b> i.e. <b>the</b> five <b>overs),</b> exploiting field restrictions (next 20% of <b>the</b> <b>overs,</b> i.e. <b>overs</b> 6-15), stabilising <b>the</b> innings-I (next 20%; <b>overs</b> 16-25), stabilising <b>the</b> innings-II (next 10%; <b>overs</b> 26-30), beginning <b>the</b> acceleration (next 20%; overs 31-40), secondary stage of acceleration (next 10%; overs 41-45) and final slog (last 10%; <b>overs</b> 46-50). <b>The</b> normal score curve is then obtained by fitting a suitable regression equation for <b>the</b> cumulative <b>overs</b> % and <b>the</b> corresponding cumulative runs scored %.|$|R

5|$|As {{the storm}} moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> East China Sea on September1, Agnes began to {{interact}} with a mid-latitude trough situated south of South Korea and began a prolonged extratropical transition. Increasing wind shear exposed {{the center of the}} typhoon and displaced convection to the north and east. Subsequent slowing of the cyclone's forward speed as it turned northward resulted in an extended period of heavy rain for much of South Korea. The JTWC estimated Agnes to have become predominantly extratropical by the end of September1, coinciding with the system weakening below typhoon intensity. The JMA, however, maintained the storm as a tropical system as it began moving northwest. The diminishing cyclone moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Korea Strait on September3 and completed its extratropical transition that afternoon. Accelerating <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Japan, the remnant storm deepened slightly before striking the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on September4 with an estimated pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg). After moving <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Okhotsk, Agnes impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia on September5. The system then moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> open waters of the North Pacific and was last noted near the International Dateline on September6.|$|E

5|$|Early on 26November, {{the former}} cyclone emerged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Carpentaria near Blue Mud Bay. Once offshore, {{a break in}} the upper-level ridge {{previously}} steering the storm eastward caused a southward shift in the track, bringing it directly over Groote Eylandt for several hours. Gale-force winds soon redeveloped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southeastern quadrant of Alessia; however, it was not re-designated as a tropical cyclone until 27November when the winds extended halfway around the circulation. As Alessia re-intensified <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southwestern Gulf, its movement became more southeasterly, taking the circulation parallel to the coast. With an anticyclone <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Northern Territory providing modest outflow for the cyclone, it continued to intensify; the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm by 0600UTC on 27November. Hours later, Alessia reached its peak strength with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a barometric pressure estimated at 991mbar (hPa; 29.27inHg). Simultaneously, it moved ashore near Wollogorang, roughly 130km (80mi) east of Borroloola. Increasing shear and land interaction caused the low- and mid-level circulations to separate, with the later continuing eastward over water. The storm soon weakened to a tropical low and its movement became erratic. Its remnants persisted for several days in the same general region, executing a clockwise loop before moving back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Carpentaria on 28November. While environmental conditions favored redevelopment once again and deep convection had formed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> system, its low-level circulation remained poorly organized. Failing to regenerate, Alessia moved eastward before doubling back to the west, passing near the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands on 30November. It was last noted on 1December <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Top End region.|$|E

5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E
