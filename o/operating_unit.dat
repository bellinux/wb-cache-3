5|$|The RAAF squadrons {{remained}} at Butterworth {{as part of}} Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. Eight Sabres, along with their pilots and ground crew, were detached from No.77 Squadron in May 1962 to re-form No.79 Squadron at Ubon, Thailand. The Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore to give the appearance {{that they were not}} drawn from the Strategic Reserve, thus preserving Malaysia's neutrality. Personnel and equipment from Nos.3 and 77Squadrons continued to rotate through No.79 Squadron on a regular basis. The Butterworth-based Sabres, armed with Sidewinder missiles, were responsible for regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia from July 1963 until August 1966, though no combat took place. From 26October until 27November 1965, a detachment of six Sabres from No.77 Squadron was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian–Malaysian border on Borneo. Following the disbandment of No.78 Wing in November 1967, No.77 Squadron became an independently <b>operating</b> <b>unit</b> under the command of Headquarters RAAF Butterworth.|$|E

40|$|Bodies such {{as those}} funding {{education}} or health services normally make use of marginal resource levels (e. g. the level of funding per pupil) to allocate resources to <b>operating</b> <b>units.</b> It is typically desired that marginal resource levels should encourage the <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> to use resources as efficiently as possible. This paper develops a method for simultaneously clustering <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> and determining {{a different set of}} marginal resource levels for resourcing the units of each cluster, consistent with the foregoing aim. The user controls the number of clusters created, striking a balance between the multiplicity of sets of marginal resource levels estimated and the strength of the incentive offered to <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> to use a resource efficiently. The clusters identified can prove useful in themselves in that <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> sharing similar environmental conditions and/or value systems are identified.

40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is a non-parametric {{method for}} measuring the efficiency of peer <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> that employ multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. Several DEA methods have been proposed for clustering <b>operating</b> <b>units.</b> However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the existing methods in the literature do not simultaneously consider the priority between the clusters (classes) and the priority between the <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> in each cluster. Moreover, while crisp input and output data are indispensable in traditional DEA, real-world production processes may involve imprecise or ambiguous input and output data. Fuzzy set theory has been widely used to formalize and represent the impreciseness and ambiguity inherent in human decision-making. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy DEA method for clustering <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> in a fuzzy environment by considering the priority between the clusters and the priority between the <b>operating</b> <b>units</b> in each cluster simultaneously. A numerical example and a case study for the Jet Ski purchasing decision by the Florida Border Patrol are presented to illustrate the efficacy and the applicability of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|Rotating {{biological}} contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film {{secondary treatment}} systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in Germany in 1960 and {{have since been}} developed and refined into a reliable <b>operating</b> <b>unit.</b> The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary clarifier where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.|$|E
