40|$|A simple {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between the QBO and the number <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> in the Atlantic, both in the Basin and hitting the U. S. coastline, demonstrates that the QBO is not a particularly useful index to help predict hurricane numbers on five-year time scales. It is shown that there is very little difference between the number <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> following easterly winds in the equatorial stratosphere and the number that follow westerly winds. Given this it is reasonable one would make better predictions just using the mean number <b>of</b> <b>hurricanes</b> in lieu <b>of</b> using the QBO and this is also simply demonstrated here...|$|R
