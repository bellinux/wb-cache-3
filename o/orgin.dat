As a result of the study, it was explained that the sea salt was carried by rain to the inner land and formed the ion proportions in the river water. It seemed to be mainly due to the difference of solubiuty to water that the rate of Na⁺Cˉ to Ca⁺⁺SO₄ˉˉin the river was lower than in the sea salt. Concerning the harogenated organics, these components are added to the river by such as air pollutants, industrial effluents and chlorinated drinking water.

"Matrix " is the Latin word for womb, and it retains that sense in English. It can also mean more generally any place in which something is formed or produced. The <b>orgins</b> of mathematical matrices lie with the study of systems of simultaneous linear equations. An important Chinese text from between 300 BC and AD 200, Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art (Chiu Chang Suan Shu), gives the first known example {{of the use of}} matrix methods to solve simultaneous equations. Since their first appearance in ancient China, matrices have remained important mathematical tools. Today, they are used not simply for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, but also for describing the quantum mechanics of atomic structure, designing computer game graphics, analyzing relationships, and even plotting complicated dance steps! The elevation of the matrix from mere tool to important mathematical theory owes a lot to the work of female mathematician Olga Taussky Todd (1906 - 1995), who began by using matrices to analyze vibrations on airplanes during World War II and became the torchbearer for matrix theory. In this work, by applying the fundamental concepts of matrices, the author attempts to study the fifth Euclidean postulate problem and Godel’s incompleteness theorems...|$|R

40|$|As public {{demands for}} its {{services}} grow and change, Victoria Police must adapt. This Blue Paper will guide {{the development of}} a new Victoria Police strategic plan for the next ten years, to 2025. Foreword Victoria Police constantly strives to meet the needs and expectations of the Victorian community. As public demands for our services grow and change, Victoria Police must consider how it should adapt over the medium to long term. Although Victoria Police has a three year corporate plan (2012 - 2015), there is no clearly laid out, long-term strategy. The Rush Inquiry criticised Victoria Police for a fragmented approach to strategic planning, including a failure to set objectives for the short, medium and long term. That’s why Victoria Police has produced this Blue Paper, as a basis for {{the development of a}} new, long-term strategic plan for the period 2015 to 2025. In particular, it outlines the strategic choices Victoria Police must make - including priorities - in a period when Victoria Police will need to do more to enhance public safety with relatively fewer resources. The Blue Paper identifies the broader social, economic and environmental trends, and internal challenges, facing Victoria Police now and in the coming years. Many of the internal issues have developed over decades; some have their <b>orgins</b> as far back as the nineteenth century. It is clear that the current operating model for Victoria Police is struggling to cope with the unprecedented demands upon it and to meet public expectations. Without a real transformation, it will not meet the expected growth and changes in demand for policing. A Vision for Victoria Police in 2025 sets out three proposed strategic directions to enhance public safety and increase value for money for the Victorian community through its investment in Victoria Police: 	better matching of resources to demand by rethinking the traditional operating model 	improving capability through workforce reform and technology 	collaborating more closely through partnerships. Sir Robert Peel, the founder of modern policing, said that “the police are the public and the public are the police”. That principle remains of great importance today. Victoria Police and the whole community need to work more closely together to make Victoria a safer place...|$|R
