5|$|Incidents {{had also}} {{occurred}} in the Soviet space program, but due to the government's policy <b>of</b> <b>secrecy,</b> these were not disclosed until well after the Apollo 1 fire. Cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance experiment in a high-oxygen isolation chamber, {{less than three weeks}} before the first Vostok manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent the public from being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} stock price {{reactions}} of four Swiss banks to negotiations between Switzerland and the European Union and between Switzerland and the United States to (i) obtain {{an estimate of the}} value <b>of</b> banking <b>secrecy</b> to Swiss banks, and (ii) distinguish between tax evasion and genuine privacy concerns as sources of that value. We find that the value <b>of</b> banking <b>secrecy</b> to the private banks is large, accounting for 8 to 14 % of their market value; in contrast, the value <b>of</b> banking <b>secrecy</b> to the universal banks is small. We further find that tax evasion may be less important and privacy concerns more important a source of value <b>of</b> banking <b>secrecy</b> than might previously have been thought...|$|R
5|$|Such {{approval}} {{was increasingly}} granted starting in 1982. In May, Venezuela, {{who had long}} examined the FX project, agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs, replacing a fleet of Mirage III interceptors and Mirage 5 ground-attack aircraft. Sweden decided {{to develop their own}} design, the JAS 39 Gripen. In September 1983, Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G/S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A/B. Greece, stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16, purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984, giving a firm pledge <b>of</b> <b>secrecy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, {{of which}} Britain was a signatory, did not ban {{submarines}} {{but it did}} ban their use against merchant ships, which was X1s unacknowledged purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates. Therefore, a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> surrounded X1, the government even going to the lengths of taking a national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized.|$|E

5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{influence was}} the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles.

Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power {{in light of the}} inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.|$|E

40|$|Banks in many {{countries}} are governed by secrecy laws regarding the bank-customer relation-ship. Lately, {{many countries}} have been pressured to tighten secrecy laws to combat the abuse <b>of</b> bank <b>secrecy</b> by ill-gotten and criminal money. Switzerland has {{played a leading role}} in tightening secrecy conditions by passing new secrecy laws, closing loopholes in existing laws, and imposing restrictions on its traditionally independent banking industry. The theoretical monetary implications <b>of</b> changing <b>secrecy</b> conditions depend largely on banks' behavior regarding their deposit rate. This paper uses intervention time series analysis to test the monetary implications by investigating the effects <b>of</b> tightening <b>secrecy</b> laws on interest rates using Switzerland as a case study.

5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge <b>of</b> <b>secrecy.</b> Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E
5|$|Most {{religious}} traditions in the Greco-Roman world {{centered on a}} particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion, only public ritual. In contrast, the cult of Isis, like Christianity and some other mystery cults, {{was made up of}} people who joined voluntarily, out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others. Christianity has its own initiation ritual, baptism, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians began to refer to their sacraments, like baptism, with the word mysterion, the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite. In this case, the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non-Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them. Their rites thus acquired some of the aura <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> that surrounded the mystery cults. Furthermore, if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris's death and resurrection, this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the death and resurrection of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 20May in {{the well-to-do}} Strand {{district}} of London, Catesby met Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes, at an inn called the Duck and Drake. Percy {{had been introduced}} to the plot several weeks after Wintour and Fawkes's return to England. Alone in a private room, all swore an oath <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> on a prayer book, and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest (and friend to Catesby) John Gerard. Robert Keyes {{was admitted to the}} group in October 1604, and was charged with looking after Catesby's Lambeth house, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Two months later Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it, and by March 1605 three more were admitted: Thomas Wintour's brother Robert, John Grant and John Wright's brother Christopher.|$|E

50|$|The {{difficulty}} in using military intelligence concepts and military intelligence methods {{is in the}} nature <b>of</b> the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> the information they seek, and the clandestine nature that intelligence operatives work in obtaining what may be plans for a conflict escalation, initiation of combat, or an invasion.|$|R

5|$|Royall and Marbury envisaged {{nuclear energy}} being {{controlled}} by experts, {{with a minimum}} of political interference. The commissioners would be appointed for indefinite terms, and the President's power to remove them would be limited. They would be supported by four advisory boards, for military applications, industrial uses, research and medicine, the membership of which would be restricted to those with technical qualifications. Day-to-day running of the organization would {{be in the hands of}} an administrator and his deputy. The Royall–Marbury Bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki lifted the veil <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> surrounding the Manhattan Project, Royall and Marbury were able to consult with the Attorney General, the Judge Advocate General and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The draft was sent to the President in August for circulation among, and comment from, affected government agencies. Only the State Department had objections, on the basis that it was still involved in trying to hammer out an international agreement on nuclear energy.|$|E
5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work on the books were {{well-known}} authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons <b>of</b> <b>secrecy,</b> translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} which {{contributed to the}} {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of South Vietnamese commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South Vietnamese civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element <b>of</b> <b>secrecy,</b> which South Vietnamese commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. It is hard to fathom how South Vietnamese commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost secrecy. So when North Vietnamese forces attacked the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, there was little South Vietnamese commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E

Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were treated with a high degree <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{devoted a}} large amount <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> for Batman Returns. The art {{department}} was required to keep their office blinds pulled down.
