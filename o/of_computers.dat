5|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the 1960s, digital {{computer}} games were created by increasingly numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost <b>of</b> <b>computers,</b> and programming languages that would run on multiple types <b>of</b> <b>computers</b> were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry with the display of the coin-operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first widely available arcade game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video game consoles.|$|E

5|$|Kilburn {{anticipated}} {{a return}} to Malvern but Williams persuaded him to stay {{to work on the}} university's collaborative project developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer. Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development <b>of</b> <b>computers</b> required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E

5|$|Space Race was {{the first}} arcade racing video game, {{as well as the}} first game with a goal of {{crossing}} the screen while avoiding obstacles, though a few racing games had been released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console. Later games in that genre are the arcade game Frogger and the Atari 2600 Freeway, both from 1981.

5|$|The 2009 {{version was}} {{released}} for sale September 9, 2008.

Average installation times range from eight to ten minutes, and the previous 2008 version had a 400 MB footprint. Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20–30 seconds to 10 seconds, and file scanning times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files. The technology works {{on the basis that}} if a piece of software runs on a significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>computers,</b> then it is safe.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the {{correlates}} <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> anxiety, using meta-analytic procedures.

Significant antecedents <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> anxiety are trait anxiety (Z=. 25), neuroticism (Z=. 24) and openness to experience (Z=-. 25). These relationships are modest in terms of effect size, suggesting that computer anxiety can be reduced through training. The significant consequences <b>of</b> <b>computer</b> anxiety are ease <b>of</b> using <b>computers</b> (Z=-. 39), and intention <b>of</b> using <b>computers</b> (Z=-. 26).
