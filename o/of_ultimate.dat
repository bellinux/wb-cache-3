5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view <b>of</b> <b>ultimate</b> female power in the poem.|$|E
5|$|First-millennium Indian scholars, such as Sureshvara (Suresvaracharya, c. 750 CE), {{have viewed}} this male-female {{dialogue}} as profound on both sides; Maitreyi refuses wealth, wishing {{to share her}} husband's spiritual knowledge, and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic story she challenges Yajnavalkya's theory of Atman.

5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During the events <b>of</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her {{skills as a}} vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her {{the ability to read}} Kitana's thoughts.

After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} <b>of</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel's new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which {{acquired}} Marvel in 2009, {{chose not to}} renew Capcom's license with the Marvel characters, instead opting {{to put them in}} its own self-published Disney Infinity series. As a result, Capcom had to pull both Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 off their online platforms in 2013. However, in 2016, Disney announced its decision to cancel the Disney Infinity series, discontinue self-publishing efforts, and switch to a licensing-only model, allowing them to license their characters to third-party game developers, including Capcom. Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was revealed in December 2016, and then released in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, {{following}} {{the success of}} their isometric Filmation game engine behind titles like Knight Lore, the Stampers founded a separate company: Rare Designs of the Future, later shortened to Rare. While Ultimate was built for the British home microcomputer market, Rare was founded with an eye toward the burgeoning Japanese video game console market, having been apprised of Nintendo by their Japanese arcade industry contacts. Nintendo initially rebuffed the brothers' interest in 1983, which led Chris Stamper to study the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware for six months. The brothers flew to Kyoto to present software samples to Nintendo executives. Nintendo purchased the Stampers' Slalom, which sold half a million units, and made the Stampers into Nintendo's first Western third-party developer. As interest in Filmation and the Spectrum began to wane, the brothers sold part <b>of</b> <b>Ultimate</b> to U.S. Gold and began to focus on Rare, though the Stampers retained a majority stake in Ultimate.|$|E

During this time they created successful titles such as Wizards & Warriors, Battletoads, and R.C. Pro-Am. Rare became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo, who came to own a large minority stake of the company. During this period, Rare received international recognition and critical acclaim for games such as Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Conker's Bad Fur Day.|$|E

5|$|During the {{genocide}} {{and in the}} months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting {{the genocide}}. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source <b>of</b> <b>ultimate</b> responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.|$|E
