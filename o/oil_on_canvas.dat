It is one of Lichtenstein's earliest Pop art works and is known for its source, which is a newspaper ad that ran for several decades and which was among Lichtenstein's earliest works sourced from pop culture.|$|E
5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas.</b> His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E

5|$|Look Mickey (also {{known as}} Look Mickey!) is a 1961 <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas</b> {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Widely {{regarded as the}} bridge between his abstract expressionism and pop art works, it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value {{as well as being}} the first example of the artist's employment of Ben-Day dots, speech balloons and comic imagery as a source for a painting. The painting was bequeathed to the Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art upon Lichtenstein's death.|$|E
5|$|Pictish stones {{dating from}} the 6th to 9th centuries {{featuring}} what has been dubbed the Pictish Beast may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature. Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in Draper's 1913 <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas.</b> Thomas Millie Dow had also sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden balanced on a rock, a common depiction for artists of the period. Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{cutaway model}} of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The model is at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model is true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (<b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas).</b>|$|E

5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas</b> {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It {{was commissioned by}} the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled La danse (Bacchante) or Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape: (1) there exists an <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas</b> study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title Two Nudes in a garden, 91.4 x 63.8cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already proto-Cubist in appearance. (4) As its name implies, Coucher de soleil no. 1 {{might have been the}} first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles Coucher de soleil no. 2 or No. 3, the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: Landscape with Fountain, for example, an <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas</b> measuring 53.3 x 73.6cm; Paysage pointilliste, 1906-07, an <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas</b> measuring 54.5 x 73cm; Matin au Parc Montsouris, ca. 1906, <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas,</b> 49.9 x 67.7cm; or even La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil, 54 x 73cm, an <b>oil</b> <b>on</b> <b>canvas</b> ca. 1905.|$|E
