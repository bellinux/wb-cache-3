2500|$|Even some of Ali's early {{followers}} {{regarded him}} as [...] "an absolute and divinely guided leader who could demand {{of them the}} same kind of loyalty that would have been expected for the Prophet." [...] For example, one of Ali's supporters who also was devoted to the Prophet said to him: [...] "our opinion is your opinion and we are in the palm <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand." [...] The early followers of ‘Ali seem to have taken his guidance as [...] "right guidance" [...] deriving from Divine support. In other words, ‘Ali's guidance was seen to be the expression of God's will and the Qur'anic message. This spiritual and absolute authority of ‘Ali was known as walayah and it was inherited by his successors, the Imams. In the first century after the Prophet, the term sunnah was not specifically defined as [...] "Sunnah of the Prophet" [...] but was used in connection to Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Uthman, and some Umayyad Caliphs. The idea of [...] "Hadith" [...] or traditions ascribed to the Prophet was not mainstream nor was Hadith criticism. Even the earliest legal texts by Malik b. Anas and Abu Hanifa employ many methods including analogical reasoning and opinion and do not rely exclusively on hadith. Only in the 2nd century does the Sunni jurist al-Shafi‘i first argue that only the Sunnah of the Prophet should be a source of law and that this Sunnah is embodied in Hadiths. It would take another one hundred years after al-Shafi‘i for Sunni Muslim jurists to fully base their methodologies on prophetic Hadiths. Meanwhile, Imam Shia Muslims followed the Imams' interpretations of Islam as normative without any need for Hadiths and other sources of Sunni law such as analogy and opinion.|$|E

In vain he declares that he got the ring from no woman, but from a dragon whom he slew; for he is manifestly puzzled; and she, seizing her opportunity, accuses him before the clan of having played Gunther false with her.|$|E

60|$|This seems {{once more}} a {{hazardous}} statement {{to make about}} a remote ancestor, in the age before the great glacial epoch had furrowed the mountains of Northern Europe; but, nevertheless, it is strictly true and strictly demonstrable. Just try, as you read, to draw with the forefinger and thumb <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand an imaginary human profile on the page on which these words are printed. Do you observe that (unless you are an artist, and therefore sophisticated) you naturally and instinctively draw it with the face turned towards your left shoulder? Try now to draw it with the profile to the right, {{and you will find}} it requires a far greater effort of the thumb and fingers. The hand moves of its own accord from without inward, not from within outward. Then, again, draw with your left thumb and forefinger another imaginary profile, and you will find, for the same reason, that the face in this case looks rightward. Existing savages, and our own young children, whenever they draw a figure in profile, be it of man or beast, with their right hand, draw it almost always with the face or head turned to the left, in accordance with this natural human instinct. Their doing so is a test of their perfect right-handedness.|$|E
