5|$|It is {{impossible}} to judge the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the psychiatrist Lore Reich Rubin, told Christopher Turner that she believed Reich had been a victim <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse, and that this explained his lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Jackson {{was accused}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse and was acquitted two years later.

According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old. Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.|$|E

Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse by Evan Chandler, {{on behalf of}} his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Robin Wright as Jenny Curran: Forrest's {{childhood}} friend {{with whom he}} immediately falls in love, and never stops loving throughout his life. A victim <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse {{at the hands of}} her bitterly widowed father, Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in the 1960s and the 1970s/1980s drug culture. She re-enters Forrest's life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterwards she dies of an unnamed illness, but given the time period, the movie's propensity for showing the major aspects of U.S. culture, and the character's depicted actions during the 60s and 70s, it can be speculated that she died of AIDS or Hepatitis C.|$|E

5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse, but the civil case was {{settled out of court}} for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication. Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. In October 2017, Forbes announced that Jackson had topped the publication's list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fifth straight year with annual earnings of $75 million.|$|E

25|$|In popular usage, {{the word}} pedophilia is often applied to any sexual {{interest}} in children or the act <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent {{children with the}} act <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.|$|E
