5|$|On December 29, NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport {{reported}} that the Bears had four candidates for the GM position: Kansas City Chiefs director of player personnel and former Bears' director <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> scouting Chris Ballard, Giants' vice president of player evaluation and 2012 finalist for the Bears' GM job Marc Ross, Tennessee Titans vice president of player personnel Lake Dawson, and Baltimore Ravens director <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> personnel Vince Newsome. Ravens' assistant general manager Eric DeCosta was also rumored to be a potential candidate by Dan Pompei, while Minnesota Vikings assistant GM George Paton declined an offer. DeCosta later announced his intention to remain with the Ravens. Later in the week, Chicago requested an interview with New Orleans Saints director of player personnel Ryan Pace and Houston Texans director <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> scouting Brian Gaine.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, the Bears {{conducted}} {{interviews for}} general manager with Gaine and Dawson. Ballard and Pace were interviewed the next day, and Pace was hired on January 8. On January 13, director <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> personnel Kevin Turks was fired. The Bears hired former Saints area scout Josh Lucas as their director of player personnel on January 18. In the scouting department, three scouts were hired on May 15. Ravens national scout Joe Douglas became {{the director of}} college scouting, Broncos assistant director <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> personnel Anthony Kelly as director <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> scouting and New York Jets area scout Christopher Prescott was hired in the same role.|$|E

5000|$|...At {{this time}} there was no {{separate}} pro class for pros due to the relatively small number <b>of</b> <b>pros.</b> They raced with the 16 Experts, making it a Pro/Am class essentially. This is why during the early years <b>of</b> the <b>pro</b> division the national number one racer of a sanctioning body could be either an amateur or professional. This practice continued until the NBA's 1979 season in which the pros earned separate pro points and a separate pro plate from the amateurs.**At the time <b>of</b> Encinas turning <b>pro</b> there was not a two tier structure <b>of</b> <b>pros</b> i.e. Junior and Senior pro class.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdaptive animal {{behaviors}} {{depend upon}} the precise development {{of the nervous system}} that underlies them. In Drosophila melanogaster, the pan-neural prospero gene (pros), is involved in various aspects of neurogenesis including cell cycle control, axonal outgrowth, neuronal and glial cell differentiation. As these results have been generally obtained with null pros mutants inducing embryonic lethality, the role <b>of</b> <b>pros</b> during later development remains poorly known. Using several pros-Voila (prosV) alleles, that induce multiple developmental and behavioral anomalies in the larva and in adult, we explored the relationship between these phenotypes and the variation <b>of</b> <b>pros</b> expression in 5 different neural regions during pre-imaginal development. We found that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>pros</b> mRNA spliced variants and <b>of</b> <b>Pros</b> protein varied between these alleles in a tissue-specific and developmental way. Moreover, in prosV 1 and prosV 13 alleles, the respective decrease or increase <b>of</b> <b>pros</b> expression, affected (i) neuronal and glial cell composition, (ii) cell proliferation and death and (iii) axonal-dendritic outgrowth in a stage and cellular context dependant way. The various phenotypic consequences induced during development, related to more or less subtle differences in gene expression, indicate that Pros level needs a precise and specific adjustment in each neural organ to allow its proper function...|$|R

5|$|Having {{reached his}} zenith, Berry {{did not have}} the same {{statistical}} success over his final seven seasons, but he remained a consistent target for Unitas. His 75 receptions in the 1961 season was second most in the league, and he finished 10th in receiving yards, but failed to record a touchdown {{for the first time since}} his rookie year. He scored the first touchdown of that year's Pro Bowl on a 16-yard reception from Unitas in the first quarter. His streak <b>of</b> <b>Pro</b> Bowl invitations ended at four, as he was not invited in 1962, but made consecutive Pro Bowl appearances in 1963 and 1964, the latter being his final. The Colts returned to the postseason in 1964, where they were shutout 27–0 by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 championship game.|$|E
5|$|Parrish, {{upset with}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation <b>of</b> <b>Pro</b> Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members <b>of</b> <b>Pro</b> Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E

5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression <b>of</b> <b>pro</b> inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{entered the}} draft with needs at {{positions}} including offensive lineman, linebacker, defensive lineman and cornerback. In the first round, with the twentieth pick, the Bears selected Oregon offensive tackle Kyle Long. Long, the son <b>of</b> <b>Pro</b> Football Hall of Famer Howie Long and younger brother of St. Louis Rams' defensive end Chris Long, played in only 21 games while starting 15 with Oregon. In the second round, with the fiftieth pick, the Bears selected Jon Bostic, a linebacker from Florida, who recorded 68 tackles with the nation's fifth-ranked defense in 2012. Two rounds later, the Bears used their 117th overall pick on Rutgers linebacker Khaseem Greene, {{who holds the}} NCAA record for career forced fumbles with 15. In the fifth round, the Bears traded down ten spots with the Atlanta Falcons to draft Louisiana Tech offensive tackle Jordan Mills, marking {{the first time the}} team selected two offensive linemen in the same draft since 2002. In the sixth round, Chicago selected Georgia Bulldogs defensive end Cornelius Washington, who led linebackers in the bench press at the NFL Combine with 36 repetitions at 225 pounds. Using a seventh-rounder acquired in the trade with Atlanta, the Bears drafted wide receiver Marquess Wilson, who left the Washington State football team, citing abuse from head coach Mike Leach despite setting team records with 82 receptions for 1,388 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2011, followed by 52 receptions for 813 yards and five touchdowns in 2012.|$|E

30|$|The authors {{acknowledged}} {{a number}} of obstacles in the study—even though there was an increased number of patients recruited, the usage <b>of</b> <b>PROs</b> in the patient-physician interaction was limited due to physician turnover and lack of completion time provided to patient prior to consultation. The authors concluded that PRO assessments should be more carefully selected to be more clearly of benefit {{to the health care}} provider and patient. Additionally, sustaining the implementation and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>PROs</b> should be constantly reinforced with clinicians [45].|$|R
30|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in the assessment <b>of</b> patient-reported outcomes (<b>PROs)</b> over the last 40 [*]years, and the use <b>of</b> <b>PROs</b> in clinical and health services research is common [1]. PROs have been defined as “any report {{of the status of}} a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else.” [2] The incorporation <b>of</b> <b>PROs</b> in clinical practice can serve numerous purposes [3] including: (1) describing a patient’s overall state; (2) screening for incipient disease and undetected disability [4, 5]; (3) monitoring disease progression and response to treatment; (4) assessing patient-centered needs; (5) formulating treatment plans consistent with patient preferences [6 – 8]; (6) improving physician-patient communication [9 – 11]; (7) providing patient-based data for quality initiatives [12 – 14]; and (8) standardizing interactions between healthcare providers and patients [3]. While the use <b>of</b> <b>PROs</b> in clinical practice can help in all of these areas [1, 15], critical questions remain about how patient outcome data should be collected, shared, and used {{to improve the quality of}} care and patient health outcomes [16]. Some reports have emerged regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>PROs</b> in routine clinical practice across different conditions [1, 17 – 22], but the incorporation of these tools in oncology clinical practice has been slower than adoption in research [23 – 26].|$|R
