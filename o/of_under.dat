5|$|After the war, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000.

5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{having been}} {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with Notts County, refereed by the Test cricketer and former England international footballer Billy Gunn, which gave {{them an opportunity to}} try out reserve players Jack Jones and Alec Leake. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3–3 draw, but the attendance <b>of</b> <b>under</b> a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, was disappointing. Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, for the fourth time this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

5|$|From 1831 to 1841, Palestine {{was under}} the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town {{suffered}} an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church.

5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas.

Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E

5|$|Hereditary {{senators}} and equites combined military service with civilian posts, a career path {{known as the}} cursus honorum, typically starting with a period of junior administrative posts in Rome, followed by 5–10 years {{in the military and}} a final period of senior positions in either the provinces or Rome. This tiny, tightly-knit ruling oligarchy <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 10,000 men monopolised political, military and economic power in an empire of c. 80 million inhabitants and achieved a remarkable degree of political stability. During the first 200 years of its existence (30 BC – 180 AD), the empire suffered only one major episode of civil strife (the Civil War of 68–9). Otherwise, usurpation attempts by provincial governors were few and swiftly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Dubna, {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 1958 and 1960 aiming to synthesize element 102 as well. The first 1958 experiment bombarded plutonium-239 and -241 with oxygen-16 ions. Some alpha decays with energies just over 8.5MeV were observed, and they were assigned to 251,252,253102, although the team wrote that formation of isotopes from lead or bismuth impurities (which would not produce nobelium) could not be ruled out. While later 1958 experiments noted that new isotopes could be produced from mercury, thallium, lead, or bismuth impurities, the scientists still stood by their conclusion that element 102 could be produced from this reaction, mentioning a half-life <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 30seconds and a decay energy of (8.8±0.5)MeV. Later 1960 experiments proved that these were background effects. 1967 experiments also lowered the decay energy to (8.6±0.4)MeV, but both values are too high to possibly match those of 253No or 254No. The Dubna team later stated in 1970 and again in 1987 that these results were not conclusive.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, the {{hurricane}} was not classified {{due to lack}} of ship confirmation; by the time it became a hurricane, the strongest winds reported by a ship was 40 mph (65 km/h) about 80 miles (130 km) southeast of the center. Additionally, upon developing a closed eyewall, the cyclone was beginning to interact with the frontal system to its west. However, late on September 3, a ship reported a pressure of 1003 mbar with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5 mb, suggesting a minimum pressure <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 990 mbar. At the time, the storm maintained a T-number of 4.0, resulting in estimated winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and an estimated pressure of 987 mbar. Maintaining hurricane status for about 18 hours, the storm continued rapidly northeastward and weakened, due to strong wind shear from the approaching cold front. Early on September 5, it is estimated the cyclone became extratropical in the Gulf of Alaska, while located about 315 miles (510 km) southwest of Juneau, Alaska. On the same day, the circulation was rapidly absorbed by the frontal system, and the remnants quickly reached the coast of British Columbia. The remnants of the storm turned southeastward, and was last tracked definitively to a point north of Montana.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{isotopes}} whose half-lives are known, {{the lighter}} isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives <b>of</b> <b>under</b> 50 μs for 253Rf and 254Rf were observed. 256Rf, 258Rf, 260Rf are more stable at around 10 ms, 255Rf, 257Rf, 259Rf, and 262Rf live between 1 and 5 seconds, and 261Rf, 265Rf, and 263Rf are more stable, at around 1, 1.5, and 10 min respectively.

5|$|Oxford University Press {{expressed}} interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become The Sea Around Us. Chapters appeared in Science Digest and the Yale Review—the latter chapter, The Birth of an Island, winning the American Association for the Advancement of Science's George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Nine chapters were serialized in The New Yorker beginning June 1951 and the book was published July 2, 1951, by Oxford University Press. The Sea Around Us remained on the New York Times Best Seller List for 86 weeks, was abridged by Reader's Digest, won the 1952 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the Burroughs Medal, and resulted in Carson's being awarded two honorary doctorates. She also licensed a documentary film based on it. The Seas success led to the republication <b>of</b> <b>Under</b> the Sea Wind, which became a bestseller itself. With success came financial security, and in 1952 Carson {{was able to give}} up her job in order to concentrate on writing full-time.|$|E

He took five wickets in an innings on ten occasions during the season, including twice in a match against Middlesex, to claim ten wickets in the match. Playing a match for Liverpool and District against the touring Australians, he took his best bowling figures in an innings that season, claiming seven wickets for 72. Crossland took a pair of five-wicket hauls against Surrey in late August to finish with eleven wickets in the match. His final match of the season was a further fixture against the Australians, in which he took eight wickets in the match for the North.
