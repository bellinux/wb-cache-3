25|$|When {{the video}} {{switches}} {{to the real}} Aguilera, she is seen descending {{from the top of}} a circus tent on a rope, onto the back of an elephant, in Pointe shoes and a structured jeweled outfit, with her father watching adoringly in the audience. She later attempts to greet him but is pulled away by fans and photographers. The content of the telegram is then revealed to be a message of her father's death, and as Aguilera realizes that she was too wrapped up in her stardom to deal with what matters, she races through the circus in a belated attempt to find her father. Overwhelmed, Aguilera collapses on the ground and then sees a shadow figure of a man {{standing in front of the}} circus tent. Hoping the shadow figure to be her father, Aguilera holds <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> with the elephant necklace on it in an attempt of reconciliation. She break down crying when she realizes the silhouette has disappeared and that her father is truly gone. The video ends with a shot of Aguilera sitting on a circus box, singing and crying, before fading out to Aguilera's grief-stricken form on the ground outside the circus tent. The camera then zooms out and Aguilera is seen on the ground.|$|E
500|$|Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and {{had set up}} his own darkroom. The {{picture on}} the {{photographic}} plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, {{and that she had}} spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to a [...] gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be [...] "nothing but a prank", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] {{live for}} the first time at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York in 2001. The performance was also part of the setlist for their World Tour. Beyoncé also famously performed the song at the 2004 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004, where it won in the category of Best Female R Vocal Performance. Beyoncé was wearing a long, glittery turquoise and silver dress. She positioned herself between the edges of a giant picture frame and sung [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] as if she were in a living oil painting. She was joined by seventeen backup singers, musicians and dancers. At the end, she held <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and a dove landed in her outstretched palm. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV News commented that the performance was [...] "nothing short of extravagant." ...|$|E

500|$|Most {{songs from}} Back to Basics were {{inspired}} by real-life events that Aguilera had experienced. The track [...] "Oh Mother" [...] talks about Aguilera's childhood with her abusive father; its lyrical theme was compared to Madonna's [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989). Her marriage with Jordan Bratman was the main theme of the album, with tracks inspired by the event including [...] "Makes Me Wanna Pray", [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "On Our Way", [...] "Without You", [...] "Mercy on Me", [...] "Save Me from Myself" [...] and [...] "The Right Man". On [...] "The Right Man", Aguilera expresses that she has found [...] "the right man" [...] for her imagined daughter as she hopes that the child {{would not have to}} experience an abusive childhood like her, [...] "One day, My little girl will reach <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and she'll know I found the right man".|$|E
2500|$|That night, Charlie Brown {{is still}} sad {{that he has}} not {{discovered}} {{what it means to be}} a [...] "good man", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that [...] "there are teeth-marks all over it [...] [...] [...] she nibbles her pencil [...] [...] [...] she's HUMAN!" [...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> making him shrink back. As he reaches out, she shakes his hand firmly, then tells him, [...] "You're a good man, Charlie Brown." ...|$|E
