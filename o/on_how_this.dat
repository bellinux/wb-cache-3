5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic {{language}} and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, {{there is more than one}} school of thought <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> occurred in Ireland.|$|E

At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E

25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> ability develops and diminishes over time. It also {{seems to be the case}} that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} convert {{malic acid}} into lactic acid as an indirect means of creating {{energy for the}} bacteria by chemiosmosis which uses the difference in pH gradient between inside the cell and outside in the wine to produce ATP. One model <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> is accomplished notes that the form of L-malate most present at the low pH of wine is its negatively charged monoanionic form. When the bacteria move this anion from the wine into higher pH level of its cellular plasma membrane, it causes a net-negative charge that creates electrical potential. The decarboxylation of malate into L-lactic acid releases not only carbon dioxide, but also a proton that generates the pH gradient which can produce ATP.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the vote was a narrow {{majority}} in favour of secession, but the coalition in parliament could not reach agreement <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> outcome should be interpreted and implemented; and because of these irresoluble differences, the coalition fell apart. A parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased {{their share of the}} vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the Folketing passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish amt was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial subsidy from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.|$|E

25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic of the trend towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of the}} last century. He had very strong opinions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E
25|$|By AD 17, the Roman proconsul of Africa, Marcus Furius Camillus (II) {{was in a}} quandary. The {{threat to}} his {{province}} was now far more serious than the usual border raiding by the desert tribes. But while Tacfarinas relied on hit-and-run raids, he had little effective response. Although his own forces (the 3rd legion and at least {{the same number of}} auxiliaries, totalling ca. 10,000 men) were now greatly outnumbered by Tacfarinas' followers, Camillus decided to capitalise on the Romans' advantages in armour and training by offering Tacfarinas a decisive pitched battle. To this end, he led out into the field most of his force. Tacfarinas felt confident that with superior numbers, his newly modelled army, combining the best elements of Roman and Numidian warfare, was equal to the challenge. His men joined battle with the Romans - and were utterly routed. Tacitus gives no details <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> was accomplished, but later events suggest that the Numidian line was probably broken by the legionary infantry charge. Tacfarinas fled into the desert with the shattered remnants of his army and Camillus was awarded triumphal honours.|$|E
25|$|As {{opinion polls}} {{conducted}} {{after the party}} crisis indicated a fall in support for PSOE, advocates of abstention argued that the question was no longer whether Rajoy would become Prime Minister again, but whether he would be elected now or after a third election, expected {{to result in a}} landslide win for the PP. The party's caretaker leadership were confident of being able to win the vote in favour of abstention, but concerned that this move would likely widen divisions within the party. Finally, the PSOE federal committee voted on 23 October to abstain, without conditions, when Congress considered Rajoy's candidacy for a second time, allowing the formation of a Rajoy minority government. Party members subsequently clashed <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> decision could be implemented in terms of party discipline, with some deputies declaring that they would not abide by the committee's decision regardless of the outcome. King Felipe VI scheduled a new round of talks for 24 and 25 October, ahead of the 31 October deadline, with a new investiture hearing set for 26–29 October upon confirmation that Rajoy had sufficient support to win the vote.|$|E

25|$|One blog writer speculated <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> {{game would}} affect the standings {{for the rest of}} the regular season. Kevin Seifert, NFC North blogger for ESPN, {{frequently}} posted the playoff standings if the Packers had defeated the Seahawks instead. Ultimately, the Packers went on to win the NFC North division title with an 11–5 win–loss record, but finished with the third playoff seed behind the second-seeded 11–4–1 NFC West champion San Francisco 49ers, and thus Green Bay's record had them play in the Wild Card round. The Seahawks ended up with an 11–5 record and the fifth seed, ahead of the sixth-seeded 10–6 Minnesota Vikings; even if Seattle had not beaten Green Bay, they would have still been the fifth seed at 10–6 because they held the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Vikings. Had the call been made in Green Bay's favor, the Packers would have finished 12-4 on the regular season and they would hold a first-round bye, which would have resulted in the 49ers hosting the Vikings in the Wild Card round. As it was, both Green Bay and Seattle eventually were eliminated in the Divisional round.|$|E

500|$|After their revolt, Heraclius the Elder and Heraclius the Younger were proclaimed joint consuls. There is no {{indication}} in the sources <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> was achieved, i.e. whether Heraclius the Elder was self-appointed or officially proclaimed by the Senate of Carthage, [...] "whose members had no legal right to designate a Roman consul". Nevertheless, {{the significance of the}} proclamation was evident. No private individuals had been proclaimed consuls since the reign of Justinian I (r. 527–565). Since then it was merely another title exclusively used by the Byzantine emperors. By this proclamation, Heraclius the Elder was arguably making a first step towards becoming emperor himself, while legitimizing his connection to the long history of Rome. The mints of Carthage and later Alexandria produced coins depicting Heraclius the Elder and his namesake son wearing consular robes.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of small chemical inhibitors of human Kinesin-5 through a pioneering in vitro phenotypic screening on cancer cell lines {{has led to}} both {{the development of new}} anticancer therapeutic agents, and to novel tools to probe the mechanism of microtubule motor proteins. [...] This toolkit of allosteric inhibitors has been used to probe the specific role of Kinesin-5 in mitotic spindle assembly [...] as well as fine dissection of motor domain function. [...] Through this work it was found that, in mammalian cells, Kinesin-5 is required for the initial assembly of the mitotic spindle during prophase and prometaphase, but is dispensable to traverse subsequent anaphase during a round of mitosis. [...] Also, the binding of the Kinesin-5 inhibitors to an allosteric site on the motor interrupts the mechanism by which this enzyme converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into the mechanical work of moving microtubules, thus providing insight <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> enzyme works.|$|E
