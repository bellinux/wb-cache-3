40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{the application of}} the ARENA computer program to simulate underground mine transport in a hypothetical mine for underground excavation of metallic minerals. A simulation of the model that simulates the real transport process of the raw ore material between two main transportation levels, connected with a central <b>ore</b> <b>bunker,</b> was made. At a higher level, raw ore the from the central ore pass for single block is transported by the rail transportation system to the central bunker, and at a lower level, raw ore from ore bunkers is exported to the surface by the underground mine trucks...|$|E

An 1892 American steel industry directory {{noted that a}} foundry, machine and pattern shops, and <b>ore</b> <b>bunkers</b> had been completed but no coke stack; in 1894 the same directory repeated that the coke stack had not been built.|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty years after the sound of the machine broke the silence of the garden, as {{examined}} in Leo Marx 2 ̆ 7 s seminal book, The Machine in the Garden, the gardens of Latz-Partner at the defunct steel plant in Duisburg-Nord Landscape park just north of Duisburg, German, sound a new note in the silenced machine of the postindustrial landscape. The gardens, each with its own unique character and color-a bright green spiral fern garden, a pink-green parterre garden, a silver-gold roof garden, a climbing rose garden, and a tranquil water lily garden-set within obsolete coal and <b>ore</b> <b>bunkers</b> and cooling tower pools and framed by dead industrial fragments, transform the ruin into a reliquary, a sacred container of memories, myths, and fantasies. They conciliate yet provoke the scarred, aging concrete containers and rusted steel vestiges, triggering the kind of intense dialogue between culture and nature that Latz+Partner seek to engage in all of their derelict post-industrial projects. A recurring gesture in Latz+Partner designs, the garden is deployed as an entry, opening up the formidable landscape to reinterpretation in ways that 2 ̆ 2 could never be engendered by either an artist or nature alone 2 ̆ 2...|$|R
