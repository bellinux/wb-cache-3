5|$|Defensively, Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich led {{all players}} with nine tackles. Of the nine stops, <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half were for {{negative}} yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was Cody Grimm, who had eight tackles, {{two and a}} half of which were for losses. <b>One</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced a fumble and broke up one Boston College pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. Boston College sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.|$|E

5|$|About the film's {{comparison}} with the novel, Chopra {{said in an interview}} that, as compared to its 1953 namesake film by Bimal Roy, the story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasising under-represented characters from the novel. In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film's cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals. Saif Ali Khan once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film's crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the 60s look.|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of previsualisation tests, {{including}} {{a scene in which}} Chitti jumps on a train to save Sana, Mohan eventually decided to use the technique in 40out of the 60visual effects scenes featured in the film, consisting of 2,000takes. Further previsualisation supervision was conducted by P. C. Sanath of Firefly Creative Studios, a visual effects company based in Hyderabad. 3D storyboards were constructed using 3Danimation programs for every scene in the film and were shot from different angles. In an interview with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu, Mohan said that all the pre-production work took <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years to complete.|$|E
5|$|As {{a four-year-old}} in 1882, Tristan showed much {{improved}} form and {{established himself as}} one of the leading racehorses in Europe by winning ten times in fourteen starts.

In the Epsom Stakes, a handicap race over <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half miles, Tristan carried top weight of 124 pounds and won by a length and a half from Retreat He then added the Epsom Gold Cup, the race which was the forerunner of the Coronation Cup, in which he successfully conceded twenty-seven pounds to a filly named Isabel.|$|E

5|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the secondest common {{cancer in the world}} and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast {{cancer is the}} commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E
40|$|Non-self-adjoint {{dynamical}} systems, e. g., nonholonomic systems, can admit {{an almost}} Poisson structure, which is formulated {{by a kind}} of Poisson bracket satisfying the usual properties except for the Jacobi identity. A general theory of the almost Poisson structure is investigated based on a decomposition of the bracket into a sum of <b>a</b> Poisson <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> almost Poisson <b>one.</b> The corresponding relation between Poisson structure and symplectic structure is proved, making use of Jacobiizer and symplecticizer. Based on analysis of pseudo-symplectic structure of constraint submanifold of Chaplygin nonholonomic systems, an almost Poisson bracket for the systems is constructed <b>and</b> decomposed into <b>a</b> sum of <b>a</b> canonical Poisson <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> almost Poisson <b>one.</b> Similarly, an almost Poisson structure, which can be decomposed into a sum of canonical <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> almost Lie-Poisson <b>one,</b> is also constructed on an affine space with torsion whose autoparallels are utilized to described the free motion of some non-self-adjoint systems. The decomposition of the almost Poisson bracket directly leads to a decomposition of a dynamical vector field into a sum of usual Hamiltionian vector field <b>and</b> <b>an</b> almost Hamiltonian <b>one,</b> which is useful to simplifying the integration of vector fields.

5|$|Charizard {{made its}} video game debut in 1996 with the Japanese release of PokÃ©mon Red and Blue. It is {{available}} only through PokÃ©mon evolution from the starter PokÃ©mon Charmander. In PokÃ©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, and their remakes, PokÃ©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Charizard is used by Red, who acts as the games' final boss. Charizard {{is one of several}} PokÃ©mon in PokÃ©mon X and Y that is able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming either Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y. It was given a Mega Evolution about <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half years into the development of PokÃ©mon X and Y. Charmander (along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle) was added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience Charizard's Mega Evolution.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed.
