30|$|The APA Algorithm {{was applied}} to the data {{collected}} for all <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> that have been detected in <b>the</b> map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city (there were 72). After running the APA Algorithm a classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes (<b>plazas,</b> in this case) was obtained according to their importance in the network. So, a ranking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city was established according to their importance in the network. In this study, the data are related to the commercial activity developed in the city, classified by different sectors.

At <b>the</b> southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Plaza</b> is <b>the</b> Ballcourt <b>Plaza,</b> surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. <b>The</b> Acropolis <b>Plaza</b> is a fully enclosed <b>plaza</b> within <b>the</b> acropolis itself. The area to <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ballcourt <b>Plaza</b> was probably <b>the</b> riverside docking area and there is evidence that <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Plaza</b> was a marketplace. A number of ceramic-lined wells have been excavated close to the site core, these were all built in the 8thcentury and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.|$|R

This is the largest building at Quiriguá and its walls are still standing. It was built during <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> [...] "JadeSky".|$|R
5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation {{was running}} a major deficit by 1996, and in April Edmonton City Council {{declined}} to renew a $100,000 annual grant which the Foundation had received since 1985. The Foundation needed cash, and quickly sold the theatre for $450,000 to Calgary’s Brar family, owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plaza</b> Theatre in that city. The decision was not popular, and even Old Strathcona Foundation member Judy Berghofer called the sale hasty.|$|E

A few Late Preclassic ceramic fragments were also recovered. <b>The</b> levelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Plaza</b> involved a considerable inversion of labour due to the limestone bedrock being extremely close to the surface at one side and [...] under the surface at the other.|$|R
25|$|According to {{archeologist}} Osvaldo Garcia Goyco, {{there is}} evidence that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plazas</b> are oriented in relation to the equinox and solstics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four seasons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. This is not unusual since the Taínos cultivated their crops in accordance to their astrological observations.
