The kibbutz was looted by the irregulars and the Legionnaires evacuated the area after the fights. In the evening the Yiftach Brigade retook the kibbutz.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> side.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Jordan mounted two counter-attacks. The {{first was}} over Beit Susin.

The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where the diversion attacks had been launched. A force the strength of a battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen armoured vehicles, attacked the kibbutz in the morning. It was defended by 68 soldiers of the Haganah (including 13 women).|$|E
5|$|Two {{unsettled}} historiographic debates exist {{revolving around}} the operation: whether the Egyptians were intending to advance toward Tel Aviv, which most historians agree {{was not the}} case; and whether the operation {{was a turning point}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> southern front. Traditional Israeli historiography, supported by early Arab accounts, maintains that it was a turning point, while later Arab sources, and New Historians, dispute this.|$|E

5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched {{a battalion of}} the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in Jerusalem {{as well as a}} contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons and spare parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize the negative effects of the debacle on the morale of the troops and on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed Aluf (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.|$|E
5|$|This {{development}} {{gave the}} Israeli forces time to organize their defenses at Samakh (Tzemah). During {{the course of}} May 16, Israeli gunboats harassed the Syrian positions on the southeastern Sea of Galilee shore, trenches were dug, and roadblocks were set up. Meanwhile, Syrian aircraft made bombing runs on Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan, Degania Bet and Afikim. The attack on Samakh (Tzemah) resumed before dawn on May 17â€”the Syrians attacked the village's northern positions, but their armor stayed behind. The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself, despite severe ammunition shortages <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> side.|$|E

5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh.

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
