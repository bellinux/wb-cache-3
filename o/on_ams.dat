Phase IA (10,200–9,700 BC) represents the Natufian occupation of Mureybet. It is characterized by hearths and cooking pits, but no dwelling structures have been identified. Among the crops that were harvested, and possibly even locally cultivated, were barley and rye. Very few sickle blades and querns were found. The inhabitants of Mureybet hunted gazelle and equids and fishing was also important.

50|$|Dates, {{that were}} {{obtained}} by the Carbon-14 dating method indicate a range between of about 30,000 and 50,000 years ago for the entire archaeological sequence.

50|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{thought of}} as Australian, boomerangs have been found also in ancient Europe, Egypt, and North America. Hunting sticks discovered in Europe seem to have formed part of the Stone Age arsenal of weapons. One boomerang that was discovered in Jaskinia Obłazowa in the Carpathian Mountains in Poland was made of mammoth's tusk and is believed, based <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> dating of objects found with it, to be about 30,000 years old. In the Netherlands, boomerangs {{have been found in}} Vlaardingen and Velsen from the first century BC. King Tutankhamun, the famous Pharaoh of ancient Egypt, who died over 3,300 years ago, owned a collection of boomerangs of both the straight flying (hunting) and returning variety.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Patients {{undergoing}} {{cardiac surgery}} with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) {{have an increased}} risk of developing postoperative pneumonia. The pathophysiological causes for this increased risk are still unclear. However it is known that cardiac surgery with CPB strongly influences the systemic immune system. Therefore a change in the pulmonary immune defense, in particular the alveolar macrophages (AMs), could be a reason for the development of postoperative pneumonia. In order to investigate this relationship, we examined the surface molecules of human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) and toll-like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR 2 / 4) <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> pre- and postoperatively. In addition, an in vitro stimulation of AMs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the subsequent measurement of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were performed. The results have been correlated to the development of postoperative pneumonia. Methods: After ethical approval and written informed consent, 33 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery were included in this observational study. Peripheral blood cells and alveolar lavage fluid were collected directly after induction of anesthesia and two hours after separation from CPB. HLA-DR expression on monocytes and <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> as well as TLR 2 / 4 expression <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> were assessed by flow cytometry. Monocytes and AMs were in vitro stimulated with LPS and the concentration of cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8 and IL- 10) was determined by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed with the Wilcoxon test and the Mann-Whitney-U test. Results: A total of three patients (9 %) developed postoperative pneumonia. Postoperatively HLA-DR expression <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> (p = 0. 001 *) and HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood monocytes (p = 0. 001 *) was significantly reduced compared to baseline in all patients. After surgery HLA-DR expression <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> (p = 0. 024 *) and TLR 4 expression <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> (p = 0. 041 *) was significantly reduced in patients who developed postoperative pneumonia compared to patients without pneumonia. Already before surgery the baseline of TLR 2 expression <b>on</b> <b>AMs</b> was significantly lower (p = 0. 027 *) in patients who developed postoperative pneumonia. After surgery the concentration of cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and IL- 8 was significantly reduced after stimulation of the monocytes with LPS. Postoperatively the concentration of the investigated cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8 and IL- 10 was not significantly reduced after stimulation of AMs with LPS. Conclusions: As far as we know this is the first study that shows an early impairment of lung cellular immune response after cardiac surgery. The findings support the hypothesis that these pulmonary changes are associated with the development of postoperative pneumonia...|$|E

40|$|Information on {{accuracy}} of milk-sampling devices used on farms with automated milking systems (AMS) {{is essential for}} development of milk recording protocols. The hypotheses {{of this study were}} (1) devices used by AMS units are similarly accurate in estimating milk yield and in collecting representative milk samples compared with devices used by certified milk recording providers on farms with conventional milking systems (CMS) and (2) devices used on both AMS and CMS comply with accuracy criteria described by the New Zealand Standard and by the International Committee of Animal Recording (ICAR). Milk recording data from 5 AMS farms were collected during 13 milk recording test days between December 2011 and February 2013. Milk yield was estimated by ICAR-approved milk meters <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> units. Milk samples were collected over a 48 -h period and submitted to an off-site certified laboratory for milk composition analysis. Data were also collected manually from 5 to 10 cows per AMS unit; a complete milking of a cow was weighed to serve as gold standard for milk yield, and 3 milk samples per cow milking were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to serve as gold standards for milk composition. A similar procedure was used during 6 milk recording occasions with devices used during conventional milk recording at a CMS research farm. Farm type, breed, season, and region did not appear to affect accuracy of devices used <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> units. Milk meters used by AMS units complied with ICAR limits in 12. 5 and 25 % of the milk recording test days for test bucket weights between 2 and 10 kg and for test bucket weights > 10 kg, respectively. These percentages were 52 and 42 %, respectively, for devices used on CMS. Analyzing all samples as one milk recording test day, 1. 4 % fell outside the 20 % difference band for AMS compared with 1. 1 % of the milk samples for CMS. Devices used by AMS complied with ICAR in 73 % of the milk recording test days for fat percentage, compared with 42 % of the milk recording test days by devices used at the CMS farm. When analyzing all milk samples as one milk recording test day, 3. 5 % of the milk samples fell outside the 99 % ICAR limit for AMS compared with 17. 2 % of the milk samples for CMS. Applying the ICAR standards for fat percentage to crude protein percentage and SCC, devices used <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> were accurate in estimating crude protein percentage but not in estimating SCC. Thus, devices <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> units did not comply with national nor ICAR standards with regard to milk yield and fat percentage. However, devices used <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> were similarly or more accurate compared with devices used during conventional milk recording. It is proposed that devices used <b>on</b> <b>AMS</b> units, when calibrated regularly and when set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction, have similar or improved accuracy compared with CMS devices. Because the New Zealand industry accepts data from devices currently used by certified providers for milk recording on CMS farms, results imply that the AMS devices should also be permitted to be used for milk recording...|$|E
