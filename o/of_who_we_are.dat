Prior to its release, guitarist Darren Middleton described it as [...] "by far the best thing we've done", an analogy that would be often made when comparing the album to its predecessor, Parables for Wooden Ears. Middleton praised the album because the band knew how they wanted the record to sound before they began to record; he also described it as [...] "the most concise continuation <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> down on record".|$|E

Santorum said he chose the song because [...] "few songs express the beauty and strength <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> as free Americans better than Krista’s." [...] The song is seen as representing the emotion of his campaign effort. David Weigel described Branch as the [...] "muse of the insurgent conservative candidate" [...] due to her songs being used by Cain and Santorum in their primary campaigns.|$|E

We got the order of songs down, and {{spent a lot of}} time honing it and making it an {{emotional}} journey. We wanted the listener to be completely moved and left breathless by the music." [...] In another interview, he called it [...] "the first record where we actually had our heads together well enough--and a had a sense <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> enough--to try to control it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Switchfoot {{was founded}} in 1996 as Chin Up, {{consisting}} of Jon Foreman and his brother Tim, along with Chad Butler on drums. After playing only a few shows, the band was contacted by music industry veteran Charlie Peacock and eventually signed to his indie label [...] under the current moniker, Switchfoot. Re:think went on to distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, The Legend of Chin, New Way to Be Human, and Learning to Breathe. Because Re:think was bought out by Christian giant Sparrow Records before Switchfoot's first release, however, the band's and Peacock's intentions of being marketed outside of the Contemporary Christian music scene and reaching a wider audience were put on hold. Consequently, the band was mostly marketed to Christian radio and retail outlets early in their careers, a time Jon Foreman has described as when [...] "half <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> was lost." ...|$|R

Lifehouse continued to promote the album on Last Call with Carson Daly on July9,2007 where they played [...] "First Time". They also performed the song on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on August15,2007. The band made an appearance at the 2008 NFL Pro Bowl on February 10, 2008. On February 15, 2008, the band performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. They performed on Live with Regis and Kelly playing [...] "First Time" [...] and [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] on April 1, 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{he gave to}} Uncut magazine in 2005 Plant recounted: We had some good songs Walking into Clarksdale, but I wasn't sure about the production. I felt kind of marooned. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> still surrounded by the protective shield <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and it meant <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing big arenas around the world. And I realised once again {{there had to be}} another way... I knew I had to get back to playing clubs and remember what pulse was all about. To say goodbye to those large arenas that I played with Jimmy was a very purposeful move.|$|R

5000|$|The band {{were often}} {{at odds with}} {{producer}} Andy Gill over the musical direction of the album. Anthony Kiedis has expressed disappointment at the overall sound, feeling that it lacked the raw energy of their original 1983 demo tape. In his 2004 autobiography Scar Tissue, Kiedis recalled [...] "One day I {{got a glimpse of}} Gill’s notebook, and next to the song Police Helicopter, he’d written 'Shit.' I was demolished that he had dismissed that as shit. Police Helicopter was a jewel in our crown. It embodied the spirit <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> which was this kinetic, stabbing, angular, shocking assault force of sound and energy. Reading his notes probably sealed the deal in our minds that 'Okay, now we’re working with the enemy', It became very much him against us, especially Flea and me. It became a real battle to make the record." ...|$|R
500|$|The Huffington Post {{published}} {{a response from}} practising Muslim Afroze Zaidi-Jivraj, a graduate in English who had recently begun a masters degree student in theology at the University of Birmingham. She remarked that Holland's methodology was flawed because he had neglected to study the corpus of material on early Islamic history found in libraries across the Islamic world, instead using only sources he had obtained in Western libraries. She argued {{that he did not}} consult a single Islamic scholar of Islamic history, instead choosing the more [...] "exotic" [...] option of interviewing a Bedouin, and that although he had consulted Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr– [...] "a token Muslim voice"– Nasr was a scholar of Islamic philosophy and not Islamic history. Asserting that Islam: The Untold Story was based on poor scholarship by assuming the superiority of secular Western historical inquiry over Islamic historical traditions, she argued that it would promote negative views of [...] "an already poorly-understood faith and its much-maligned adherents." [...] Abdullah al-Andalusi of the Muslim Debate Initiative sums Islam: the Untold Story as [...] "a missed opportunity to transcend an outdated Besserwissen approach to comparative religion, and to establish an inter-faith dialogue based on insightful mutual understanding and acceptance <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> today. While informed revisionist readings of the history of all faiths, Islam included, is to be encouraged, Tom Holland’s TV show, an anti-Islamic polemic dressed up as history, does not do what it says on the tin.

500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

40|$|Overview Use it, or lose it? That’s the {{question}} George Megalogenis thinks Australia {{needs to be}} asking itself. In his 2012 book, The Australian Moment, Megalogenis presented a meticulous case for Australia’s social resilience and economic potential through times of global hardship – recalling {{the end of the}} goldrush in the 1850 s, and a society at odds with a government intent on tightening immigration and hoarding our wealth. His latest book, Australia’s Second Chance, extends the argument into post-GFC, post-mining boom times. Can we do better with the advantages we gained from the boom? Could Australia embrace a future rich not only in natural resources, but in human resources, too? What must we do to realise our underplayed capacity for prosperity? Join Megalogenis – one of Australian journalism’s great minds – as he weaves history, economics and demography into questions <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> and <b>who</b> <b>we</b> could become.  ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1988, stress {{over the}} closing of his play Just Say No, {{only a few weeks}} after its opening, forced Kramer into the {{hospital}} after it aggravated a congenital hernia. While in surgery, doctors discovered liver damage due to Hepatitis B, prompting Kramer to learn that he was HIV positive. In 2001, at the age 66, Kramer was in dire need of a liver transplant, but he was turned down by Mount Sinai Hospital's organ transplant list. People living with HIV were routinely considered inappropriate candidates for organ transplants because of complications from HIV and perceived short lifespans. Out of the 4,954 liver transplants performed in the United States, only 11 were for HIV-positive people. The news prompted Newsweek to announce Kramer was dying in June 2001, and the Associated Press in December of the same year to claim Kramer had died. Kramer became a symbol for infected people who had new leases on life due to advances in medicine. [...] "We shouldn't face a death sentence because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> or who we love", he said in an interview. In May 2001, the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute at the University of Pittsburgh– which had performed more transplants for HIV positive patients than any other facility in the world– accepted Kramer on its list.
