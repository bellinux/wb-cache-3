5|$|Albert of Habsburg died on 27 October 1439. The {{majority}} of the Hungarian noblemen elected Władysław III of Poland king in early 1440. Władysław made the talented military commander, John Hunyadi, voivode of Transylvania in February 1441. Hunyadi who decided to restore the influence of Hungary in Wallachia ordered the burghers of Brașov to mint coins for Vlad around 15 October. Two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> later, Hunyadi came to Târgoviște to meet Vlad, demanding him to join a crusade against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Black Box Studios is {{a theater}} {{group based in}} Congregation Beth Shalom, that has a {{relationship}} with the Bergen PAC in Englewood. The actors are mostly children and teens ages 10–16, with a 7–9 year old workshop, and an adult workshop. There are two to three performances presented in the first two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of January, and {{the first two weeks of}} June. Drama and musical theatre summer camps are offered.|$|E
5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered {{once every two}} <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> and kept nearly dry during the winter months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E

Students' practice period of fourteen weeks/semester is carried out in close cooperation with FASTIP, Banks and Enterprises.|$|R
50|$|Treatment for Toxocara cati {{infections in}} cats is rather simple. There {{are a number}} of de-worming {{medications}} that will kill the adult worms; however, most drugs are ineffective against the immature parasites. Consequently, infected cats will usually need multiple doses administered in two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>week</b> intervals in order to fully eradicate the worms.|$|R

5|$|The LRDG now began {{a series}} of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July 'T' Patrol left for the desert to the south of the Gulf of Sirte. One 'T' Patrol truck managed to observe the main coastal road, along which Axis traffic was passing. They were {{followed}} two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> later by 'S' Patrol, who carried out a similar reconnaissance between Jalo oasis and Agedabia. Both patrols returned safely to Kufra without being discovered. In August 1941 'R' Patrol relieved 'G' and 'Y' Patrols at Siwa and was joined by 'T' Patrol in October.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took only two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
5|$|Welles hired Bernard Herrmann {{to compose}} the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in {{as few as}} two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had {{sufficient}} time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces {{for some of the}} montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough for two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, {{producing}} the Noddy in Toyland pantomime {{in just two}} <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season {{for five or six}} years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre {{three or four times a}} week. TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were unprepared {{to deal with}} the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of the}} trench and spent two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.|$|E
50|$|In April 1917, {{during a}} brief period of German aerial {{supremacy}} a British pilot's average life expectancy was 93 flying hours, <b>or</b> about <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of active service. More than 50,000 airmen from both sides died during the war.|$|R

5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{caterpillars}} grow fast in warm weather, sometimes pupating {{within a}} month. Caterpillars have 4 moults in total. The pupa remains {{attached to a}} foodplant stem by a silk girdle. Pupation lasts for two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> and in good years there can {{be as many as}} three generations per year, with adults still on the wing at the beginning of November.|$|E

25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or {{carboplatin}} <b>or</b> oxaliplatin) every <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> with fluorouracil (5-FU) either continuously <b>or</b> every <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial – for example – compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused fluorouracil or capecitabine.|$|R

25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will lay her eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary.
