50|$|After {{the death}} of Baisnab Charan his son Yadab Sing ascended the throne. He {{suffered}} the irony of fate. In the mean time the British company won the Battle of Plassy in 1757 A.D. In 1760 A.D. Major Johnton obtained the right to collect the revenue of Midnapore district from Mirkasim. The collectors appointed by the East India Company were empowered to collect revenue all over the country. Yadab Chandra Sing paid Rupees 12549 and 4 annas as annual revenue to the collector ofBurdwan. Yadab Chandra founded Yadabnagar. During his reign the devastating famine of 76 (1769 A.D., Bengali era 1176) saturated Bengal. Yadab Chandra could not send revenue to the collector of Burdwan. He informed the company of his distress. The Company suspected that the king intentionally stopped payment of revenue.The Council sent order to the king {{to appear before the}} council. The king did not respond. Suspension of the Company was confirmed. The Company suspected the king insurgent. The Company mobilized British soldiers in Sahebdanga. The British soldiers captivated Yadab Chandra and brought him to the Fort William. The company confiscated the kingdom of Bagri on the ground of non-payment of revenue. The subjects were reluctant to pay revenue to any person other than that of the royal family. In 1772 A.D. Yadab Chandra died in Fort William.There is a hearsay that Yadab Chandra committed suicide by sucking diamond ring. Company rule continued for 7 years. Failing to collect revenue the company granted Charter of Bagri to Yadab Chandra's son Chhatra Sing (II) in 1779 A.D. The subjects continued demonstration of agitation. Agitation turned into insurgency. The English writers called the <b>offened</b> subjects 'rowdy' (Chuar) and called the massagitation 'Rowdy Rebellion' (Chuar Bidroha), Under the leadership of Achal Sing, the Commander-in-Chief of Chhatrapati Sing II the rebels became terrific. The British soldiers could not captivate Achal Sing. Chhatra Sing could not meet the demand of revenue. Again in 1784 A.D. Bagri Kingdom was confiscated 146 villages were conferred to the king of Bagri as freehold. Collection of revenue came {{under the control of the}} company. A permanent collector was appointed. In 1806 A.D. the revolt under the leadership of Achal Sing became very strong. The opportunist British took refuge to Chhatra Sing. As a result of joint conspiracy of the king and the company Achal Sing was caught. In the other opinion a faithful follower of Achal Sing betrayed and caused to catch him in temptation of rent-free landed property. Without trial Achal Sing and 13/14 other rebel leaders were sentenced to death by hanging. Even after Achal Sing's death by hanging the suspension of the British towards Chhatra Sing was not removed. Three hundred soldiers were sent under the commandership of Charles Richard Barwell and Henry Okbay to subdue the rebels. At first Chhatra Sing II was captivated and sent to the bunglow of Hooghly. On 11 April 1817 his power was seized. He was endowed an annual grant of Rs. 6000/-.His entrance in Bagri was prohibited.Chhatra Sing had no son but only one daughter. His daughter had three sons - Gajaraj, Chadra Mohan and Manomohan. For extriction of their maternal grandfather Chandra Mohan and Monomohan were busy in adulation of the British. A rebel Biswanath by name was very powerful. He had a bulky body. So people called him Bhoda (Fatty). A reward was declared for his catch and it was also proclaimed that his catch would ensure the king's extrication. Chandra Mohan and Monomohan killed Biswanath and displayed his truncated head and thereby obtained a reward of Rs. 500/- and a certificate of loyalty to king. In 1823 A.D. (Bengali Era 1230, 7th Kartik) Chhatrapati Sing II was acquitted on the bond containing six conditions. After enjoying grant for sometime Chhatrapati Sing died on 25 May 1825.Chhatra Sing nominated Manomohan the successor of his throne. On 6 August 1825 Company sanctioned Rs. 6000/- as annual grant for him. Manomohan died on 1 April 1873. Monomohan had three sons - Jagajjiban, Mitrajit and Jagattaran. They were not allowed annual grant. Afterwards H. L. Harison initiated to sanction them an annual grant of Rs. 1500/- with effect from 3 September 1878. Jagajjiban died on 25 April 1906 and thereafter the annual grant stopped for ever.Jagajjiban had three sons - Rajaram, Keshari and Ramchandra. In spite of their utmost effort they were refused annual grant. At Present their successors are at Monglapota.|$|R
