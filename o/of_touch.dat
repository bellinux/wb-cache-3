40|$|Abstract—Character {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} step of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system. The segmentation <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> symbols {{is one of the key}} factors which affect the performance of recognition system. Therefore, to make OCR systems more effective and accurate, segmentation <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> characters {{is an important}} task. This paper explains the concepts <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> characters and presents the survey of various approaches for touching character segmentation...|$|R
25|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite packing of unit balls is the graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. The cardinality of the edge set of the contact graph gives the number <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> pairs, the number of 3-cycles in the contact graph gives the number <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> triplets, {{and the number of}} tetrahedrons in the contact graph gives the number <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> quadruples (in general for a contact graph associated with a sphere packing in n dimensions that the cardinality of the set of n-simplices in the contact graph gives the number <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> (n+1)-tuples in the sphere packing). In the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, non-trivial upper bounds on the number <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> pairs, triplets, and quadruples were proved by Karoly Bezdek and Samuel Reid at the University of Calgary.|$|R

5|$|Octopuses {{also have}} an {{excellent}} sense <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> The octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what it touches. Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E

5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E

Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E
5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E

50|$|Based on the Body Language Project, {{touching}} is {{the most}} developed sense at birth and formulates our initial views <b>of</b> the world. <b>Touching</b> {{can be used to}} sooth, for amusement during play, to flirt, to expressing power and maintaining bonds between people such as with baby and mother. Touching can carry distinct emotions and also show the intensity <b>of</b> those emotions. <b>Touch</b> absent <b>of</b> other cues can signal anger, fear, disgust, love, gratitude and sympathy depending on the length and type <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> that is performed. Many factors also contribute to the meaning <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> such as the length <b>of</b> the <b>touch</b> and location on the body in which the touching takes place.|$|R
