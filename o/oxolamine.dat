40|$|The {{possible}} {{reason for the}} significantly greater AUC of oral warfarin with oral <b>oxolamine</b> in male Sprague-Dawley rats was evaluated. After oral administration of warfarin at a dose of 2 mg/kg to male rats with <b>oxolamine</b> at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, the AUC values of warfarin were significantly greater than the controls (254 and 330 versus 180 mu g h/ml). However, the AUC values of warfarin were not affected by <b>oxolamine</b> in female rats. This {{could be due to}} inhibition of CYP 2 B 1, 2 C 11 and 3 A 2 by <b>oxolamine</b> in male rats, since warfarin was metabolized via CYP 1 A 1, 2 B 1, 2 C 6, 2 C 11 and 3 A 2 in rats and CYP 2 B 1 is male dominant, and CYP 2 C 11 and 3 A 2 are male specific. Therefore, phenytoin, torasemide and clarithromycin (mainly metabolized via CYP 2 B 1 / 2, 2 C 11 and 3 A 2 in rats, respectively) were administered intravenously to male rats with or without oral <b>oxolamine.</b> After oral <b>oxolamine</b> at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, the AUC of phenytoin was significantly greater (1280 and 1640 versus 938 mu g min/ml), however, the AUC values of torasemide and clarithromycin were independent of <b>oxolamine.</b> The above data suggest that the significantly greater AUC of oral warfarin with oral <b>oxolamine</b> could be due to inhibition of CYP 2 B 1 / 2 by <b>oxolamine</b> in male rats.

40|$|The general {{pharmacological}} properties of <b>Oxolamine</b> (3 -phenyl- 5 β-diethylaminoethyl- 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole) are described. The antitussive activity of this drug is more apparent in tests involving a diffuse {{stimulation of the}} bronchial tree than with electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve. These results suggest a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action. <b>Oxolamine</b> also possesses analgesic-anti-inflammatory, local anaesthetic and antispasmodic properties. The acute and chronic toxicities of <b>Oxolamine</b> are low, and the experimental results indicate the absence of side effects. The possibility that the antitussive activity {{is related to the}} other {{pharmacological properties}} is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{new high}} {{performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method {{was developed for}} the determination of paracetamol, phenylephrine hydrochloride, <b>oxolamine</b> citrate and chlorpheniramine maleate in combined pharmaceutical formulations and dosage forms. The separation was performed on an Agilent Zorbax SB-CN column with the mobile phase consisting of 0. 02 M phosphate buffer (pH: 4) and acetonitrile (85 : 15,v/v) in flow rate 1. 5 mL at 22 °C. The overall retention time of the analytes was 3. 5 min. The method was validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy and recovery. The relative standard deviation for 10 replicate measurements of paracetamol, phenylephrine HCl, <b>oxolamine</b> citrate and chlorpheniramine maleate were 0. 12, 0. 36 0. 18 and 0. 59 %, respectively. Total recoveries of analytes were 99. 99, 100. 56, 100. 20 and 99. 60 %, respectively. No chromatographic interference from the tablet excipients was found. The linearity of paracetamol, phenylephrine HCl, <b>oxolamine</b> citrate and chlorpheniramine maleate were {{in the range of}} 20 - 120 μg/mL, 0. 4 - 2. 4 μg/mL, 8 - 48 μg/mL and 0. 16 - 0. 96 μg/mL, respectively. This simple, fast, economical and precise high performance liquid chromatographic method can be adopted for routine quality control analysis...|$|E
