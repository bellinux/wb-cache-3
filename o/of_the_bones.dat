40|$|With Warburg's {{apparatus}} {{the author}} studied <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> various antileukemic agents such as nitromin, myleran, 8 -azaguanine, 6 -mercapurine, prednisolone, ACTH, actinomycin C, and carzinophilin directly to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur <b>of</b> normal rabbits, and obtained the following results. 1. Nitromin at <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> 10 (- 1) g/dl seems to inhibit <b>the</b> respiration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow, and <b>the</b> oxygen consumption every 10 minutes decreases along with laps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. 2.

5|$|Since {{the remains}} of brain cases found in shell middens are broken and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> found exhibit cut marks, {{it is assumed that}} the sea mink was hunted by Native Americans for food, and {{possibly}} for exchange and ceremonial purposes.

5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E

5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken place.

5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones,</b> and are crucial to development.|$|E
50|$|Radiographs {{initially}} show {{layers of}} periosteal {{new bone formation}} with cortical thickening. Periosteal new <b>bone</b> may cover <b>the</b> diaphysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> causing an increase in diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone.</b> Over time, <b>the</b> periosteal new <b>bone</b> density increases, becoming homogenous with the underlying cortex.

30|$|Each pin {{should be}} {{inserted}} across <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> and avoid eccentric (intracortical) insertion. Attention to this detail ensures <b>the</b> threaded part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> half-pin engages <b>the</b> widest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> {{and is thus}} better able to control it. However, whilst this is eminently possible when applying a straight rail to a straight <b>bone,</b> <b>the</b> sagittal profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> femur is curved and some screws will inevitably not lie across <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>The</b> technique below, which describes <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> screw insertion and centralising the position, will optimise <b>the</b> spread <b>of</b> screws despite this anatomical issue.|$|R
40|$|Acid {{phosphatase}} activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow and peripheral serum {{were measured}} in the patients with carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostate or benign hyperplasia diagnosed at <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Urology, Hiroshima University Hospital. The enzyme levels were comparatively examined with bone x-rays and bone scintigrams. 1) Three cases of benign hyperplasia all showed normal peripheral and bone marrow serum acid phosphatase activity. 2) In five cases (41. 7 %) of 12 stage C carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostate, prostatic acid phosphatase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow-l was elevated. Two (11. 8 %) of stage D carcinoma showed normal range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same phosphatase probably due to antiandrogenic treatment progressing. 3) Those without radiological metastasis to <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> showed <b>the</b> prostatic acid phosphatase level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral serum. The patients with radiological metastasis showed no difference between both compartments. 4) In the patients without radiological metastasis to <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> total acid phosphatase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow- 1 was elevated in 6 (37. 5 %) of 16 cases having normal total serum acid phosphatase. The prostatic acid phosphatase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow-l was elevated in 2 (18. 2 %) of 11 cases having normal prostatic acid phosphatase level. 5) In 2 (16. 7 %) of 12 cases lacking of x-ray finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis, <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> metastasis was detected in bone scintigraphy. 6) In 2 (20. 0 %) of 10 cases free of metastatic finding in <b>bone</b> scintigraphy, <b>the</b> total acid phosphatase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow- 1 was elevated. One of them developed <b>bone</b> metastasis on <b>the</b> repeated <b>bone</b> scintigraphy three months later. 7) Death within two years was experienced in 4 (36. 4 %) of 11 cases without radiological bone metastasis, in 2 (25. 0 %) of 8 cases having normal prostatic acid phosphatase level, in 2 (22. 2 %) of 9 cases free of metastasis on bone scintigraphy, 2 (25. 0 %) of 8 cases having normal total acid phosphatase level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow- 1 and in one (20. 0 %) of 5 cases having normal prostatic acid phosphatase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow-I. From <b>the</b> above results, it is stressed that measurement of acid phosphatase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more sensitive examinations compared with x-ray, scintigraphic or serum acid phosphatase study.

5|$|In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> in the skeleton, making them hollow. Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build could sustain. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large {{to get rid of all}} the excess heat through their skin.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|Other dinosaurs {{from the}} Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight include the theropods Neovenator, Aristosuchus, Thecocoelurus, Calamospondylus, and Ornithodesmus; the ornithopods Iguanodon, Hypsilophodon, and Valdosaurus; the sauropods Pelorosaurus and Chondrosteosaurus, and the ankylosaur Polacanthus. The Papo Seco Formation of Portugal where Baryonyx has been {{identified}} is composed of marl, representing a lagoon environment. Other dinosaur remains from the area include fragments tentatively assigned to Mantellisaurus, a macronarian sauropod, and Megalosaurus. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> of Portuguese specimen ML1190 were damaged, and some scratches may be marks from small scavengers. The specimen's disarticulation indicates it was transported from a more-terrestrial environment (since many bones are missing), but those found were close together.|$|E

5|$|The age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> {{at death}} matched that of Richard {{when he was}} killed; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly {{consistent}} with physical descriptions of the king.

5|$|The {{aging of}} adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton {{is to look at}} bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bones.</b> The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
