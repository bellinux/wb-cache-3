5|$|Gaga's {{wardrobe}} {{throughout the}} entire video primarily consists of only one outfit which was designed by Gianni Versace. The dress consists of a S-inspired outfit, with heavy gold jewelry, studs on the leather, and vibrant nail polish and lipstick.

Aside from Gaga herself, Clemons is the only other person to appear in the video.|$|E

5|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, {{released}} on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It {{was produced by}} Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O-Pura to encompass a variety of <b>other</b> <b>music</b> genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to jwé and <b>other</b> <b>music</b> performed for entertainment, Saint Lucia {{is also home}} to styles used only for specific occasions. These include work songs, drinking songs, funereal music and serenades and masquerades. The latter two traditions are nearly extinct in modern Saint Lucia. The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year's Day, which included an orchestra consisting of a tanbou tenbal, chakchak and a bamboo flute. This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called séwinal in Lucian Creole.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{frequently}} {{collaborated with}} Mancini in television as well, {{such as in}} the series Peter Gunn (19581961) and Mr. Lucky (19591960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that he was using him for practically all his scores and <b>other</b> <b>music</b> at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 19591960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 19591962), and the film version of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).|$|E

Key often sells albums and singles on this label at the convention Comiket. Key Sounds Label is not under contract with JASRAC, or any other Japanese copyright collecting agency. As such, the releases on the label are not sold in Japanese stores with <b>other</b> <b>music</b> albums and singles, but are still widely available for online purchase.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{a remote}} {{parallel}} was {{the development of}} Shibuya-kei, which also revisited the trend of foregrounding instruments like strings and horns in its arrangements. The genre was informed by classic Western pop music, especially the orchestral domains occupied by Burt Bacharach, Brian Wilson, Phil Spector, and Serge Gainsbourg. Unlike other Japanese music scenes, its audiences did not necessarily cross over into anime fandoms, but rather indie pop enthusiasts. This was partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Shibuya-kei ultimately peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving into <b>other</b> <b>music</b> styles.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the majestic yet fairly traditional compositions by the two Strausses and Khachaturian, Kubrick used four highly modernistic compositions by György Ligeti that employ micropolyphony, the use of sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly. This technique was pioneered in Atmosphères, the only Ligeti piece heard in its entirety in the film. Ligeti admired Kubrick's film but, in {{addition to}} being irritated by Kubrick's failure to obtain permission directly from him, he was offended that his music was used in a film soundtrack shared by composers Johann Strauss II and Richard Strauss. <b>Other</b> <b>music</b> used is Ligeti's Lux Aeterna, the second movement of his Requiem and an electronically altered form of his Aventures, the last of which was also used without Ligeti's permission and is not listed in the film's credits.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with <b>other</b> <b>music</b> and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{earliest}} churches on the site although {{a little of the}} fabric has been dated to the 12th century. Much of the current building dates from the late 13th and 14th centuries when it was built and decorated by wealthy merchants of the city whose tomb and monuments decorate the church. The spire fell after being struck by lightning in 1446 and was not rebuilt until 1872. Little of the original stained glass remains following damage in the English Civil War with extensive new glass being added during the Victorian era. The tower contains 15 bells designed for full-circle English-Style change ringing. <b>Other</b> <b>music</b> in the church is provided by several choirs and the Harrison & Harrison organ.|$|E

In 2006, Isobel Campbell's collaboration with Mark Lanegan, Ballad of the Broken Seas, was included in the shortlist, despite Lanegan being American, as the album was eligible due to Campbell's British citizenship, while Guillemots, whose album was also shortlisted in 2006, contained band members from Brazil and Canada, although the majority were from the UK.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} folk metal is a diverse {{collection}} with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music. While bands like Primordial and Finntroll perform black metal, other {{groups such as}} The Lord Weird Slough Feg ply their trade with a more traditional or power metal base. The German-Norwegian group Midnattsol blends the genre with gothic metal. Progressive tendencies can be found among some bands including Elvenking, Lumsk and Týr. Some bands are known to adopt more than one different styles of heavy metal. Orphaned Land combines folk metal with progressive and doom/death metal. The band formed in 1991, also combining Jewish, Arabic, and other West Asian influences while Ensiferum mix folk music {{on top of a}} power and death metal hybrid. A few groups are also known to incorporate the styles of <b>other</b> <b>music</b> genres outside of heavy metal. Examples include the punk rock in the music of Glittertind and the neofolk and post-rock tendencies of Agalloch.|$|E
5|$|Any album {{released}} by a British artist, or by a band where over 50% {{of the members}} are British, may be submitted for consideration by their record label. The shortlist is chosen by an independent panel of musicians, music presenters, music producers, music journalists, festival organisers and other figures {{in the music industry}} in the UK and Ireland. The prize is open to all types of music, including pop, rock, folk, urban, grime, dance, jazz, blues, electronica and classical. Presentation of the awards usually takes place at an Awards Show in October, after the shortlist is announced at the Album of the Year Launch in September. It is often observed that bands whose albums are shortlisted, or win the prize, experience a large increase in album sales, particularly for lesser known acts. Each shortlisted artist receives a specially commissioned 'Albums of the Year' trophy at the Awards Show. Unlike some <b>other</b> <b>music</b> awards, the overall winner of the Mercury Prize also receives a cheque; in 2017, the prize money was £25,000. The winner also receives an additional winner's trophy.|$|E

In 1968, plays were performed jointly with Kesteven and Sleaford High School. At the end of World War I, a cadet corps as formed by one Captain Price and became part of the Army Cadet Corps under the War Office; attendance at weekly parades was compulsory for pupils over 13 in the 1920s.
