5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself {{this would not be}} sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} Figure 5.2's speed lines {{provides}} a good example <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is inappropriate {{to use the term}} choke in association with a maximum flow of all centrifugal compressor speed lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this reason there is seldom a reason to illustrate centrifugal compressor performance below 60% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Smith {{requested}} {{a meeting with}} the head of the Justice Department's Voting Rights Section in order to discuss whether political appointees had been involved in the decision to narrow the case, stating that news reports contradicted the Justice Department's earlier claim that political appointees had not been involved, and that earlier congressional inquiries about this had been unsuccessful. Smith and Wolf also requested that the voter intimidation charges which had been previously been dropped be refiled. In January 2010, after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the requested information from the department, Wolf sought a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the Justice Department to provide Congress with the details <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> narrowed the case. In a vote along party lines, the resolution was defeated 15-14.|$|E

500|$|In 1885, {{a hidden}} {{structure}} under the base was accidentally discovered. The [...] "hidden footing" [...] contains reliefs, 160 {{of which are}} narratives describing the real Kāmadhātu. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved. The real base is hidden by an encasement base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill. There is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to Vastu Shastra, the Indian ancient book about architecture and town planning. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was commissioned, the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.|$|E
500|$|Other philosophers, however, have {{suggested}} that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes. No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> {{would not be possible}} for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a philosophical zombie) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function F being performed by conscious organism O and non-conscious organism O*, it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide. As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement. Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired. [...] Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory {{in the context of the}} development of higher-order consciousness (see Neural correlates section above).|$|E

500|$|Mike Wass, {{a writer}} for Idolator, wrote that [...] "Lovebird" [...] {{was one of the}} two best songs on Glassheart, along with the title track. He further commented that it had strong radio potential, {{and that it would be}} {{successful}} if it were to be released in the United States, as it sounds like a [...] "clone" [...] of [...] "Bleeding Love". Digital Spy critic Lewis Corner felt that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] as well as [...] "Better in Time". Although he noted that Lewis' vocal performance on [...] "Lovebird" [...] is very impressive, as with all her material, he was unsure <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> was included on the final cut of the album due to Glassheart having [...] "bigger" [...] songs on it, which were likely to chart better. [...] The Mirrors Clemmie Moodie thought that although the recording is a [...] "catchy" [...] song, it does not compare to [...] "Bleeding Love", but noted that it does contain [...] "lyrical gems", including “Your lovebird's flyin’ away, ’cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". Hermoine Hoby, writing on behalf of The Observer, wrote that Lewis appears to be following in the footsteps of singer-songwriter Adele, due to the inclusion of [...] "big heartfelt ballads" [...] such as [...] "Lovebird" [...] and [...] "Fireflies" [...] on Glassheart. For Hoby, Lewis' vocals are just as [...] "technically irreproachable" [...] as Whitney Houston's and Mariah Carey's.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the first}} {{monument}} {{race of the}} season, Milan–San Remo, the team {{was thought to be}} one of the top favorites. They had three potential candidates for victory in Hushovd, Farrar, and Haussler, all of whom had shown good form during the season and Farrar and Haussler had race wins to their credit. They admitted that they each envisioned different scenarios which would lead to their respective potential victories, possibly complicating things for the team, but they remained committed to riding as a team. Each was separately viewed by analysts or fellow riders as a favorite for the day, as well. The race played out differently from these expectations. On the Le Manie climb, [...] from the finish, Hushovd crashed from roughly the middle of the peloton, leading to the race effectively being split in two. The crash also cost Hushovd one of his wheels. While teammate Vansummeren obligingly offered the world champion one of his, Hushovd stated after the race that the crash ended his chances at victory, since he could not pedal at full strength due to a hip injury. Farrar was also caught behind this split, but Haussler was able to make the selection. He had his choice leadout man Klier with him, but he was unable to make the day's final split on the Poggio, finishing the race in 18th place 27 seconds behind the eight-rider group who contested the win. After the race, team manager Vaughters admitted that the race had not gone to plan, and attributed Haussler not making the selection on the Poggio to a lack of endurance stemming from not having ridden a Grand Tour or any single-day race of this length in nearly two full seasons. Vaughters also stated that this race made for a good example <b>of</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> is usually folly to designate a leader in advance of a single-day race, since nearly anything can happen on any given day.|$|E
