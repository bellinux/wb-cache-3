50|$|Aggregation is {{important}} in the subsoil, the layer below tillage. Such aggregates involve larger (2- to 6-inch) blocks of soil that are more angular and not as distinctive. These aggregates are less impacted by biological activity than the tillage layer. Subsurface aggregates are important for root growth deep into the profile. Deep roots allow greater access to moisture, which helps in drought periods. Subsoil aggregates can also be compacted, mainly by heavy equipment on wet soil. Another significant source of subsoil compaction is the practice of plowing with tractor wheels in the <b>open</b> <b>furrow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Longitudinals—The whole {{surface is}} {{roughened}} by rather coarse oblique lines of growth, which {{on the upper}} whorls appear as oblique, reticulating ribs. The color of the shell is white, with a translucent calcareous layer over nacre. The spire is rather high and scalar. The apex is a little flattened down and rounded. The minute rounded embryonic 11 whorls scarcely rise above the level. The six whorls show a rather rapid increase, with a narrow flat shelf below the suture, thence sloping flatly to the shoulder carina, from which point the contour line descends perpendicularly. The base of the shell is inflated at the edge and flattened in the middle. The suture is deeply impressed between the narrow flat shelf below and the overhanging carina above. The aperture is slightly oblique, but with a perpendicular columella, round, and nacreous within. The outer lip is thin, transparently porcelaneous on the edge, but thickened by nacre within. The columellar region of the inner lip is perpendicular, rounded within the aperture, advancing to a sharp point in front, slightly revertedbut not appressed, having a small <b>open</b> <b>furrow</b> and a minute umbilical chink behind it.|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-section}} averaged Advection-Dispersion equation (ADE) {{model was}} developed to simulate the transport of fertilizer in furrow irrigation. The advection and dispersion processes were solved separately by implementing the method of the characteristics with cubic spline interpolation (and natural boundary condition) and weighted finite difference scheme respectively. A zero-flux boundary condition during advance and an advective gradient at the downstream end of an <b>open</b> <b>furrow</b> were established. Local pseudo-steady state was assumed in order to apply Fischer's longitudinal dispersion equation under non-uniform and unsteady furrow flow conditions. Also, several parameters were {{used to evaluate the}} ADE model and fertigation performance. A field tracer experiment in two types of downstream-end furrow and two treatments was conducted and described. Infiltration and roughness parameters were calibrated by implementing a volume balance approach. The calibrated parameters were used as input data to run the surface irrigation model (SRFR). The roughness coefficient was 0. 045 for wheel and 0. 055 for non-wheel furrow treatment for bare soil. The root mean square error (RMSE) comparing the computed and observed infiltrated volume was in the range of 0. 09 - 0. 38 m 3. The close match between simulated and observed data indicates an acceptable calibration. Pulses of fertilizer injected at the head end of four furrows each having unique management characteristics were simulated satisfactorily during the entire duration of the irrigation event. The constant value of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient was 1 m 2 min- 1 and yielded an acceptable space-time evolution of the pulses of tracer injected. Similar results for the dispersion coefficient were obtained with Fischer's equation in non-uniform and unsteady stream flow conditions in the furrow. An evaluation of several fertigation strategies for furrow systems indicated that fertigation by pulses could help reduce leaching and runoff losses in surface irrigation systems...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the local}} common practice of handpicking {{did not significantly}} reduce white grub populations. This {{might be due to}} the fact that the grubs were collected only from a small proportional area of the field, such as from the <b>opened</b> <b>furrow</b> for planting. At that time period, grubs are still not aggregated around crop roots or tubers as there is still no crop. And later, during mechanical weeding and during earthing up of potatoes, only between-row soil was searched. But at this time, grubs are expected feeding on the tubers and roots. Consequently, handpicking likely misses a large part of the pest population; thus, the effect of this method is limited.|$|R

Bean seeds were covered with 150 ml (layer 2 3 cm) of pasteurized soil infested with dried sclerotia of M. phaseolina (2 g/kg soil). Results of the field evaluation were similar to those obtained from the greenhouse. Twenty-two and 15 accessions were classified as resistant (disease severity rating [DSR] = 1 3) and intermediate (DSR = 3. 1 6. 0), respectively, following the CIAT evaluation scale of 1 (no visible symptoms) to 9 (plants dead).

40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn root worm, wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of chemical used by metering pesticide into a modified seed tube fitted with a brush to hold granules in the seed tube. As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the <b>open</b> <b>furrow</b> near the seed. Modifying seed tubes with a brush introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the seed tube modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary corn planter row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} problem initiated this study. In the Haarlemmermeer, {{a former}} lake reclaimed about 1850, several farmers had difficulties with soil structure. Land, plowed in autumn, was very wet in spring. Free water was sometimes {{present on the}} soil surface. Planting and seeding were long delayed in spring and yields were unsatisfactory because of irregular crop development. Some farmers ascribed it to pressure from the back wheel of the tractor in the <b>open</b> <b>furrow</b> during plowing, compacting the subsoil and severely reducing permeability. Plowing practices were therefore changed. Equipment was used that could be moved by driving the tractor with all four wheels over the normal soil surface. This sometimes needed very old horse ploughs, adapted to tractors. Other farmers tried to improve drainage by laying more tile drains alongside existing systems, but usually the drains did not conduct water. The problems occurred on several soil types, but especially on the somewhat lighter textured sandy loams of the Hoofddorp Complex (Pgb) (Haans, 1954). The Agricultural extension service helped {{in the selection of}} two farms, where a pedon was selected. In one, henceforth called G, no problems occurred. In the other, called B, soil structure had deteriorated. Morphological and physical properties of each pedon were frequently investigated for about 18 months. Soil management was left to each farmer. Profile descriptions, particle size distributions and routine analytical data of each pedon are in Appendix I. Differences in these values between the two profiles are mainly a result of soil management. Originally the carbonate content of Pedon G was very low throughout. The content of 1 %, as found now in the surface soil only, results from the application of lime for 30 years. The subsoil still contains no free carbonates. On Pedon B, decalcification during the formation of the profile, caused by a vegetation (Haans, 1954) was less pronounced. At about 50 cm the profile has much lime deposited as shells and small fragments. The surface soil, however, has been decalcified. It has not been limed as much as Pedon G as is shown by the difference in pH value (Appendix I). Pedon G has been green-manured and dunged for at least 25 years. During the last 10 years every field of the farm has been used for the growth of grass during three years, to be followed by use as arable land for the next three years. When wheat is grown, the soil is always green-manured. The field where Pedon G is found was notoriously bad about 1930. The surface soil had a weak unstable structure. Continued investment in lime and careful management has converted it into a productive soil. Pedon B, however, is on a field whose ownership has changed several times over the last thirty years. It was never green-manured until 1966. The surface soil therefore contains less organic matter and lime than that of Pedon G. The particle size distribution of the two pedons is identical. Average yields, as roughly estimated by the farmers from varying data of several years, were different for both farms. For sugar beet a yield of 50 tons, for wheat of 5. 0 tons per ha was considered normal for farm G. For farm B this was 40 and 4. 5 tons respectively. Such uncontrollable yield values, however, are not satisfying for describing soil quality and suitability. More important therefore was the opinion of the farmers that in general, soil B seemed more susceptible to structure deterioration and offered more problems than soil G. The suitability for agriculture of soil B was therefore considered inferior to that of soil G. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate this general statement and to describe it in quantitative terms. Before discussing the results of the fieldwork and a series of model experiments, the term suitability, as used when comparing both soils, must be explained. The soil is used by the farmer to produce agricultural crops. His profit is determined by a difference between crop value and costs. A low yield may not necessarily be unfavourable, at least not when relatively high prices are being paid, as may be expected when generally low yields are found on other soils. On the contrary, in a year when average yields are high, prices tend to be lower. Then, in spite of higher yield, the amount of cash received for the crop may be lower as well, whereas costs of management will be simular. Prices, however,, not only vary as a function of the amount of supply but also because of differences in quality. Cost figures are governed by the system of management of the farmer. Certain costs are inevitable, like those for seeding or planting and those for fertilization. The procedure followed in practice and its efficiency will determine its magnitude. Others, seem less inevitable. Some tillage practices for example are subject to discussion in this regard. Each farmer will judge the quality of his land considering these factors. He will call a soil suitable when a regular and high production, both in volume and quality, is possible, especially in years when the general productivity level is low. Besides, each crop to be grown is one from a cycle of different crops grown in a specific pattern of rota-lion. His final opinion on suitability will therefore be based on a judgment, considering the degree of financial succes by which certain crops can be grown during the years as a part of a rotation, that seems most lucrative. A farmer will thus be able to give a description of the quality of each of his fields, based on experience of many years and on his own system of management that he considers to be the best. The question of suitability of certain soil types as shown on a soil map will be posed to the soil surveyer, whether he likes it or not. Access to the experience of farmers is then indispensable. A soil scientist however, will have to realize that his pattern of thinking may differ from that of the farmer. He primarly thinks in terms of well described and classified soil types, as expressed on soil maps, that have been formed in a certain parent material under influence of the soil forming factors. He digs a pit and considers one of its vertical walls. The picture obtained then is considered representative for the type of soil. A farmer thinks more in terms of management and economy. and above that in fields of landuse. A certain field will normally be covered by several soil units of the map. This is certainly true when relatively large fields are present, to enable efficient use of machinery. To get a suitability concept for a certain soil type, occurring on different farms, the soil scientist has to normalize as good as possible all factors not directly related to his object of study, the soil profile itself (Vink & van Zuilen, 1967). These factors are: the capability of the farmer, expressed by his management; landshape and accessibility of the land and the type and size of farm, as well as the usual system of crop rotation. Except for these factors it should be realized that each judgement is a clear function of the general economic situation, changing with time. Yields obtain on a certain type of soil usually vary considerably among years on the same field and also in the same year on different farms. Differences in weather during the growing season contribute to the first phenomenon, differences in soil management to the second. Modern agriculture shows many points of agreement with industry, emphasizing an increase in production for each worker. Therefore mechanization developed. In a relatively short period of time concepts of soil productivity and management have changed. Practical problems, often concerning soil structure and soil stability, are submitted ever more frequently to specialists. Their judgment, based on an analysis of farmers experience, can only be given in a rather static agricultural system. When this system changes, as is the case with the present general drive to mechanization, the answers of the past no longer satisfy. Therefore an independant analysis should be made of the soil profile and its soil material only, describing its range of variable properties as a function of soil management. This will be attempted in the next chapters for the two pedons of discussion...|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{process by}} which a soil conservation strategy has evolved within the UK forestry industry is briefly reviewed. Particular attention {{is given to the}} development of practical and effective guidelines to prevent both soil damage and sediment entering water courses. It is concluded that the ‘Forest and Water Guidelines’, together with other forest industry manuals, largely provide adequate protection for aquatic habitats from pre-afforestation cultivation and from harvesting activities. The problem of soil erosion owing to ploughing of <b>open</b> <b>furrows</b> has largely been obviated by improved drainage network design coupled with the use of vegetated buffer strips and sediment catchpits. Alternative site preparation techniques, such as ‘moling’ or ‘dolloping’ of afforestation sites, are now preferred. However, the effects on slope hydrology and the improved soil conservation associated with these methods require quantifying. Additional understanding of effective buffer strip function, for example, on a variety of slope angles, soil types and vegetation associations would be beneficial. The design of forest roads and the associated network of drains, culverts and sediment catchpits is addressed in forestry guidelines. Future potential in this area may involve the use of Geographical Information Systems in the effective design of road networks which minimise adverse effects on slope hydrology. Similarly computer simulation of flow routing might aid in the design of road drain networks. At the more local scale there remains scope for further research aimed at minimising soil disturbance by machinery. Consideration should also be given to the long-term sustainability of the soil structure through second and subsequent crop rotations. <br/...|$|R

In a certain way, the mechanism used in seeders to <b>open</b> <b>furrows</b> for the deposition of fertilizers can have great importance in facilitating root penetration. This study was carried out to evaluate the influence of two fertilizer distribution mechanisms and N fertilization in upland rice (Oryza sativa) under NTS. The experiment was carried out in the growing seasons 2001 / 2002 and 2002 / 2003, in Botucatu, state of São Paulo, Brazil. A completely randomized block design was applied, with subdivided plots and four replications. Main plots consisted of two furrow opening mechanisms (furrow opener and double disk). Subplots consisted of four side dressing N levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha- 1). The following parameters were evaluated: furrow and seed deposition depth, plant population, plant height, number of stems and panicles m- 2, number of spikelets per panicle, spikelet fertility, weight of 1, 000 grains, shoot dry matter, grain yield and N levels in the flag leaf. The success for upland rice establishment under the NTS in dry winter regions of Brazil is directly associated to the furrow opening mechanism of the seed-drill. The furrow opener mechanism resulted in deeper seed deposition, consequently decreasing seedling population, number of panicles per area and grain yield. Side dressing N fertilization in upland rice under NTS increases grain yield whenever the double disk mechanism is used to sow...|$|R

40|$|Smooth plowing {{with the}} help of {{reversible}} plows has replaced an enclosure method of soil treatment. The method may cause a formation of back ridges or <b>open</b> <b>furrows.</b> Due to this fact turnings of a tractor unit with a minimum radius required in order to ensure shuttle movements each time in the furrow of the preceding operating stroke have become a dominant type of turnings. Non-productive shift time is directly dependent on them and it is on the average 10 – 12 %, and it is up to 40 % in small contour areas with short run. Large non-productive time is connected with the desire to reduce headland width at field edges, and then a turning is made in several stages while using a complicated maneuvering. Therefore, an increase in efficiency of a plowing unit by means of minimization on its turning radius and execution of turning at one stage in the shortest possible time are considered as relevant objectives. In such a case it is necessary {{to take into account the}} fact that potential capabilities of universal tractors having established time-proved designs in respect of reduction of turning radius are practically at the end. So it is expedient to solve the matter at the expense of additional removable devices that ensure transformation of tractor wheel formula at the run end in order to reorient its position. Finally high quality plowing ensured by future-oriented reversible plows will be accompanied not only by output increase per shift, but also by decrease in headland width, their compaction and abrasion due to suspension systems and increase in productivity. The developed design having a novelty which proved by an invention patent and representing an additional supporting and maneuvering device significantly minimizes all the above-mentioned disadvantages and does not require any changes in tractor production design.

40|$|A field {{inoculation}} {{method was}} developed to produce Meloidogyne spp. infestation sites with minimal quantities of nematode inoculum and with a reduced labor requirement compared to previous techniques. In a preseason-methyl bromidefumigated site, nematode egg suspensions were delivered at concentrations of 0 or 10 x eggs/m of row where x = 2. 12, 2. 82, 3. 52, or 4. 22 through a drip line attached to the seed firmer of a commercial 2 -row planter into the <b>open</b> seed <b>furrow</b> while planting cowpea. These treatments were compared to a hand-inoculated treatment, in which 103. 1 eggs were delivered every 30 cm in 5 ml of water agar suspension 2 weeks after planting. Ten weeks after planting, infection of cowpea roots was measured by gall rating and gall counts on cowpea roots. A linear relationship between the inoculation levels and nematode-induced galls was found. At this time, the amount of galling per root system in the hand-inoculated treatment was less than in the machine-applied treatments. Advantages of this new technique include application uniformity and low population level requisite for establishing the nematode. This method has potential in field-testing of Meloidogyne spp. management strategies by providing uniform infestation of test sites at planting time...|$|R

Seven types of snail habitats were considered here. Compared to the numbers of snail populations recorded from 1976 to 1992, the values noted from 2013 to 2016 were significantly lower, with a decline rate of 34 % for G. truncatula and 23 % for O. glabra. Variations in this decline rate with the type of snail habitat were also noted. The greatest decreases in the numbers of snail populations were noted for spring heads located in meadows and for road ditches, while the lowest were noted for <b>open</b> drainage <b>furrows</b> present in meadows. The distribution of these habitats according to their area did not show any significant change over time. In contrast, overwintering snails were significantly less numerous in 2013 – 2016 in five types of habitats for G. truncatula and in three types only for O. glabra. Several causes underlie this population decline. Among them, the current development of mechanical cleaning in open drainage systems and road ditches, that of subsurface drainage in meadows, and regular gyro-crushing of vegetation around temporary spring heads were the most important...|$|R

30|$|The {{productivity}} and environmental {{benefits of the}} minimum- and no-till aspects of conservation agriculture have been variously documented in the literature (Erenstein 2003; Hobbs 2007). Minimum tillage (or no-till) is a seedbed preparation method that involves minimizing the number of tillage operations by making only limited slots for placing the seed, either by using specialized machines (seeders) that <b>open</b> up small <b>furrows</b> in which seed is placed or by manually using ‘jab planters’, hoes or dip sticks to bore holes into which seeds are placed. In such cases, there is minimal soil disturbance since {{the rest of the}} field is left untilled. Mulching typically involves retaining crop residues and other plant materials on the surface of the plot to cover as much soil surface as possible. The mulch protects the soil from erosion, sun and wind, and the superficial biomass enhances infiltration and provides nutrition to the biota that aerate the soil. Erenstein (2003) enumerated the beneficial impacts of mulching on soil conservation, soil ecology, crop yields and the environment. If implemented properly, the combination of minimum tillage (or no-till) and mulching can alleviate or even halt soil erosion and lead to water conservation and reduced runoff, groundwater replenishment and enhancement of soil biota. In some cases, yield stabilization and increases have also been observed (Erenstein 1999, 2003).|$|R

Os tratamentos comparados foram: sem adubo; calcário; fósforo e potássio; calcário, fósforo e potássio; mucuna; calcário e mucuna; fósforo, potássio e mucuna; calcário, fósforo, potássio e mucuna. Esta foi semeada entre as linhas do milho, após o início do florescimento deste, sendo incorporada ao solo, de mistura com a palhaça do cereal, algumas semanas depois da colheita das espigas. A adubação com fósforo mais potássio aumentou significativamente a produção do milho em quatro localidades. Em regra a presença do calcário não modificou o efeito dessa adubação, mas a da mucana o tornou mais pronunciado. Em média do período que durou cada ensaio o calcário praticamente não aumentou a produção. Notou-se, porém, que nos ensaios mais prolongados seu efeito tendeu a melhorar com o decorrer dos anos. O efeito da mucuna foi significativo e positivo em Tatuí, Capão Bonito e Pindorama, mas foi nulo em Limeira e ligeiramente negativo em Engenheiro Hermilo. Em Pindamonhangaba, cujo ensaio só durou um ano, ela não poderia ter efeito fertilizante. No início dos ensaios a resposta à mucuna pouco se modificou com a presença do calcário ou da adubação com fósforo mais potássio; nos últimos anos, porém, ela se tornou mais pronunciada na presença dessa adubação ou daquele corretivo. O modo de aplicação do corretivo e dos adubos parece ter retardado consideravelmente sua influência sobre o efeito da leguminosa. Os resultados obtidos indicam que em regra o efeito da inter-calação da mucuna é {{excelente}} em solos repetidamente cultivados, mas variável, por vezes muito pequeno, nus que permaneceram incultos por vários ano. This paper {{reports the}} results obtained in gix trials conducted in different zones of the State of São Paulo and designed to study mainly the effect of under-sowing the com crop, grown without rotation, with velvet beans (Stizolobium sp.). While one of the trials, at Piadamonhangaba, was interrupted after the first crop, the others, located at Capão Bonito, Pindorama. Tatuí, Limeira, and Engenheiro Hermilo, were conducted respectively for 10, 10, 9, 5 and 3 years. The treatments compared were the following: none; ground limestone; phosphorus and potassium; limestone, phosphorus and potassium; velvet beans; limestone and velvet beans; phosphorus, potassium and velvet beans; limestone, phosphoruB, potassium and velvet beans. The phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied annually in the <b>furrows</b> <b>opened</b> for the corn seed; the limestone was applied also annually and in the mentioned furrows, except {{in the last three}} years of the trials of Capão Bonito, Pindorama and Tatuí, when it was broadcast. The velvet beans were sown in a row between each pair of corn rows, after the beginning of the taaseling stage, and were turned under with the stovers few weeks after the harvest of the corn ears. In most of the experiments the corn yields were fairly to highly increased by the application of phosphorus plus potassium. The response to limestone was generally very small when judged by the averages of the whole period of each trial; it was observed, however, that in the longer trials it tended to grow better as the years passed, mainly in the presence of velvet beans. Excluding Pindamonhangaba, whose trial was conducted for only one season, the under-sowing of velvet beans increased significantly the corn yields at Tatuí, Capão Bonito and Pindorama, but not at Limeira and Engenheiro Hermilo. In the general averages of each of the experiments of Tatuí, Capão Bonito and Pindorama the response to the addition of velvet beans was practically the same in the absence or presence of either limestone or phosphorus plus potassium; during the last years, however, it was fairly better in the presence of both the amendment or the fertilizers. The application of these near the corn but far from the velvet bean plants seems to have delayed considerably their favorable influence on the effect of the leguminous. At Engenheiro Hermilo the velvet beans failed to grow, apparently because the soil was poor, the leguminous was not directly fertilized and the experiment was of short duration. The velvet beans grew fairly well at Limeira; but this trials was located on a pasture and it seems that the soil was well supplied with nitrogen. The results obtained indicate that the effect of under-sowing velvet beans is generally excellent in soils repeatedly cropped in the previous years, but doubtful in areas that have been fallow for some time...|$|R

But while the battle to maintain food production may be getting harder, {{it is not true}} that farmers have no power. Protecting and improving the quality of their soil, for instance, can {{have a major impact on}} crop yields, and can even help to compensate for low rainfall. In Zambia, the Programme Against Malnutrition(PAM) is currently advising farmers to practice what is called ?Conservation farming? as a way of protecting their fields from erosion and building soil fertility and water-holding capacity. This was just one of several strategies that Chris Kakunta learned about when he spoke to Hurrington Kanema, PAM?s Central Province co-ordinator. Hurrington begins by explaining some of the other ways that the organisation is helping farmers to cope with the changing climate. IN:		?One of the things that? OUT:		?made use of by the plants. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Hurrington Kanema of Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition. Transcript Kanema	One of the things that we are doing is that we are promoting crop diversification. We believe that with a wide range of crops being grown, farmers are able to cope with these dry spells, because then they plant a range of crops which are tolerant to different levels of moisture limitations. For example, we are trying to help farmers to plant a cereal crop, but also within those cereal crops, we try to encourage them to plant the short season varieties, say of maize or sorghum, which mature in a short period, so that even when we have a dry spell, farmers will have some food at the end of the season. Secondly we are trying to promote root and tuber crops. One of the crops we have been working on is cassava. In these areas where we are, in Central Province for example, cassava has not been a traditional crop, but now it has become necessary, because cassava is more drought tolerant, and once you plant it you are assured that you are going to have your food over a long period of time. In addition to that one of the other strategies we have embarked on is conservation farming. Farmers need to use methods which will help them grow crops even when there is very little moisture. Kakunta	And what methods are we talking about here? Kanema	Some of the conservation methods we are using here, are the basins, as we can see these holes around here, so that moisture will be captured in these basins for a longer period. Kakunta	There are two types of holes I can see here. There are these smaller ones, and these bigger ones. Why are they so different? Kanema	What we call the basins are just dug-out small holes which they use for planting. And then there are what we call the ripped lines, the lines which are ripped with oxen. So farmers with work oxen, we encourage them to use the ripper: it?s faster, they can also cultivate a bigger area. You know when you dig these small holes with a hand hoe, it?s quite hard, there?s a lot of work involved. But with work oxen you are able to <b>open</b> up the <b>furrows</b> very early and be able to plant in these furrows. Kakunta	You mentioned that these holes are actually able to conserve some moisture. How exactly is that done? Kanema	What we do is when we open up these holes, they are about 15 cm deep, we then put in some manure, and they are covered and we leave just about 5 cm or so. So that when the rains come the farmers can plant, and water is captured in these holes. Because it has been dug, this area is very soft, so when it rains, the little water which falls goes straight into these holes, and it is stored in the soil, and it is made available to the seed which we are going to plant. So this moisture is not wasted, it does not just run off. So the idea of conservation is we are conserving not just the moisture, but also the nutrients. Kakunta	So in other words you are actually conserving the soils as well as helping the farmers cope with the changes in the weather? Kanema	That?s true. Because you see, the idea of conservation is that we are not ploughing the whole area; the farmer is just digging this place where he needs to put his seed. The rest of the land remains intact; the stubble or whatever is left in the field to add to the nutrients of the soil. So you are improving your soil. And in the long term you are also improving the structure of the soil so that it captures more moisture; the nutrients are there in the soil, that is why it is conservation farming. And in addition to that you improve the long term well-being of the farmer. They are able to get a better crop than when they are all the time ploughing. Most of the time you will see when they plough, when there is so much rain, the rain just washes away your soil, so there is a lot of erosion taking place because of that. But with an area like this, where they have not ploughed, they have just made holes where they plant, there is no run-off, very little run-off. The little water running off goes into these basins, and it is made use of by the plants. End of track. A co-ordinator for Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition explains methods of conservation farming which can help to conserve both soil moisture and nutrients in areas experiencing dry spells...|$|R
