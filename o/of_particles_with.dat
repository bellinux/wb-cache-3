In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> <b>with</b> negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E

25|$|Boltzmann {{is perhaps}} the most {{significant}} contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> <b>with</b> their degrees of freedom. The Boltzmann equation for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of thermodynamic probability as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.|$|E

25|$|The {{power of}} isospin {{symmetry}} and related {{methods such as}} the Eightfold Way come from the observation that families <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> <b>with</b> similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under {{the action of the}} Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the strong force behaves the same under the exchange of the up and down quark (and by extension the exchange of the proton and the neutron).|$|E

The nucleons in atomic nuclei also exhibit a wave-like nature and lack standard fluid properties, such as friction. For nuclei made of hadrons which are fermions, Bose-Einstein condensation does not occur, yet nevertheless, many nuclear properties can only be explained similarly by a combination of properties <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> <b>with</b> volume, in addition to the frictionless motion characteristic of the wave-like behavior of objects trapped in Erwin Schr√∂dinger's quantum orbitals.|$|E
