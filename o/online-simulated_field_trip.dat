40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to obtain insight into what {{students}} and teachers think about <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> in ecology and whether they think that fieldtrips result in increase of students’ learning. Open questionnaires and half structured interviews were used to investigate this. Persons who answered the questionnaires and participated in the interviews were senior high school teachers in biology or science and high school science students. All the teachers and most of the students thought that <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> in ecology resulted in increased learning. Those students who had spent more time on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> found it more learning and fun than students which had spent less time on <b>field</b> <b>trips,</b> which can indicate that if students spend more time on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> they think it is more fun and that they learn more.

The research was conducted {{in the context of}} a I-day geologic <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> by 296 students in Grades 9 through I 1 in high schools in Israel. The study combined qualitative and quantitative research methods.

The educational quality of a <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> is determined by its structure, learning materials, and teaching method, and the ability to direct learning to a concrete interaction with the environment.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>trips</b> provide {{opportunities}} for students to experience many different contexts beyond the classroom, and are a popular choice of K- 12 teachers in the US. Recent interest in learning that occurs at informal science education centers such as museums, zoos and aquariums has stimulated studies of the relationship between learning in and outside of schools. Although many studies focus on the teachers, the contexts, and/or the students during the <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> only a few look at the entire process of learning by including the classroom setting before and after the <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> This study was designed to develop understandings of the student process of learning during and surrounding an environmental science <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> to an outdoor setting. John Dewey's extensive writings on the relationship between experience and learning informed the analysis, creating a focus on active and passive elements of the experience, continuity within and across contexts, the interactive nature of the experience and the importance of subject matter. An exploration of environmental education (EE), environmental science (ES), and nature study as content revealed the complexities of {{the subject matter of the}} <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> that make its presentation problematic. An urban school was chosen to contribute to the research literature about urban student learning in outdoor environments. 	 	During the <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> the students' active engagement with each other and the environment supported meaningful remembrances of the <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> experiences during interviews after the <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> The students accurately described plants and animals they had observed in different habitats during the <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> They also made connections with their home life and prior experiences in the outdoors as they discussed the <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> and drew pictures that represented their experiences. One student integrated his outdoor experience with a language arts assignment as he reflected deeply on the <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> 	One implication of this study is that educational experiences in outdoor natural environments are complex in ways that contribute to lack of continuity between science lessons in an elementary classroom and environmental science <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> Long term relationships between schools and informal settings that recognize the strengths of both contexts in terms of student learning processes surrounding <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> experiences are needed to strengthen the educative process for <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> participants...|$|R

Furthermore, introductory courses are often taught {{with a traditional}} lecture style that is poor at engaging students. This study examines the impact of augmented reality (AR) <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> exercises on the interest levels of students using readily accessible mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) {{as a means to}} provide simulated <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> experiences to a larger number of learners. The results of this study, involving 874 students from five different institutions, show that students who completed three geospatially oriented Grand Canyon <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> game modules were significantly more interested in learning the geosciences than control students and participants who completed only one module. More comprehensively, results from hierarchical linear modeling indicate three strong predictors of student interest in learning the geosciences: (1) the student 2 ̆ 7 s initial interest, (2) being a STEM major and (3) the number of AR <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> modules students complete. Notably, the race and gender of participants are not factors. Augmented reality <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> for mobile devices have potential to be an accessible and financially viable means to bring <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to a diversity of students who would otherwise experience none.

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>trips</b> are {{a common}} {{strategy}} used in science education. Researchers have found that student learning on <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> (such as to museums) can occur. Researchers have suggested that a series of curriculum-connected activities (which occur before, during, and after the trip) make learning more likely. This study establishes the influential factors and experiences on four teachers who implemented curriculum-based <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to a science center with explicit connections to ongoing student learning. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Model and Pugh’s Transformational Experiences construct were {{used to examine the}} role of prior experiences in shaping these teachers’ educational <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> practice. Influential factors on educational <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> practice were found to originate from teacher beliefs, as well as the context of the teacher {{at the time of the}} <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> Teacher valuation of factors (e. g., state standards and grade level curriculum) depended on a dynamic between their previous experiences and core beliefs (e. g., sense of responsibility, sense of purpose, desire to continuously improve one’s craft, and self-preservation). Transformational experiences (Pugh, 2011) punctuated the development of <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> practice over time, yet a cycle of “trial and error” akin to the process of Experiential Learning (Kolb, 1984) sufficiently described the overall way in which teachers had developed educational <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> practice. Familiarity with the science center was instrumental in each teacher’s implementation of a curriculum-based <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> Therefore, multiple previous visits (both personal and professional) to the science center were considered vital in the development of educational <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> practice. Finally, experiences (e. g., museum open houses, professional development workshops, and previous <b>field</b> <b>trips)</b> were not one-size-fits-all, rather, the impact of these experiences was dependent on personal and contextual factors at work on the individual teacher...|$|R
