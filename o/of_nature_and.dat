5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> <b>and</b> so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E

5|$|Springbok {{inhabit the}} dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. The International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> Natural Resources classifies the {{springbok}} as a least concern species. No major {{threats to the}} long-term survival of the species are known; the springbok, in fact, {{is one of the}} few antelope species considered to have an expanding population. They are popular game animals, and are valued for their meat and skin. The springbok is the national animal of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN (International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> Natural Resources) {{lists the}} serval as least concern; {{the animal is}} also {{included}} in CITES Appendix II. A major threat {{to the survival of}} the serval include the degradation of wetlands and grasslands. Trade of serval skins, though on the decline, still occurs in countries such as Benin and Senegal. In western Africa, the serval has significance in traditional medicine. Pastoralists often kill servals to protect their animals, though servals generally do not prey upon livestock.|$|E

5|$|The {{conversation}} {{poems are}} {{a group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807.

They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is threatened by}} the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion.

5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers {{areas with}} fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African {{countries such as}} Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The royal antelope has been categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> Natural Resources (IUCN). The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat {{to the survival of}} this antelope is hunting for bushmeat.|$|E
5|$|The serval prefers {{areas with}} cover such as reeds and tall grasses and {{proximity}} to water bodies, such as wetlands and savannahs. It {{is rare in}} northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa. The International Union for the Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the serval as least concern. It occurs in protected areas across its range, and hunting of servals is either prohibited or regulated in several countries.|$|E
5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> <b>and</b> the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower {{form the basis for}} a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley would be able to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.|$|E

5|$|Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) (Griffith, 1821): Also {{called the}} Iranian or Indian cheetah. Formerly {{occurred}} across the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to the International Union for Conservation <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> Natural Resources (IUCN), it {{is confined to}} Iran, and is thus the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia. It has been classified as Critically Endangered. A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60. Later, a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100; the majority of individuals {{were likely to be}} juveniles. The population has declined sharply since the mid-1970s.

5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E

The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link {{retrieves}} the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E
