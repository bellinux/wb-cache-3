50|$|Fresnel {{zones are}} seen in optics, radio communications, electrodynamics, seismology, acoustics, {{gravitational}} radiation, and other situations involving the radiation of waves and multipath propagation. Fresnel zone computations are used to anticipate <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearances</b> required when designing highly directive systems such as microwave parabolic antenna systems. Although intuitively, line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver seems to be all that is required for a strong antenna system, due to the complex nature of radio waves, obstructions within the first Fresnel zone can cause significant weakness, even if those obstructions are not blocking the line-of-sight signal path. For this reason, it is valuable to do a calculation {{of the size of}} the 1st, or primary, Fresnel zone for a given antenna system. Doing this will enable the antenna installer to decide if an obstacle, such as a tree, is going to make a significant impact on signal strength. The rule of thumb is that the primary Fresnel zone would ideally be 80% clear of obstacles, but must be at least 60% clear.|$|E

According to the requirements of <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> surveying at QT airport, aerial and satellite imagery were used to generate DSM, by means of photogrammetry, which was spatially analyzed with the hypothetical 3 D obstacle limitation surfaces (OLS) to identify the potential obstacles.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Obstacle {{crossing}} is compromised following stroke. The {{purpose of}} this study was to quantify modifications during <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> following stroke. Subjects. Twelve subjects with stroke and 12 subjects without stroke participated in the study. Methods. Kinematic variables were measured while participants crossed a 4 -cm-high obstacle. Subjects with stroke walked at a self-selected speed; subjects without stroke walked at a comparable speed and at a self-selected speed. Results. Several modifications were observed following stroke with both groups walking at self-selected speeds. The affected lead limb was positioned closer to the obstacle before crossing. Affected trail-limb <b>clearance</b> over the <b>obstacle</b> was reduced. Both affected and unaffected lead and trail limbs landed closer to the <b>obstacle</b> after <b>clearance.</b> Swing time was increased in the affected lead limb after <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance.</b> Fewer modifications were detected at matched walking speed; the trail limb still landed closer to the obstacle. Discussion and Conclusion. Modifications during obstacle crossing following stroke may be partly related to walking speed. The findings raise issues of safety because people with stroke demonstrated reduced clearance of a 4 -cm obstacle and limb placement closer to the <b>obstacle</b> after <b>clearance.</b> [Said CM, Goldie PA, Culham E, et al.

40|$|Abstract — Motion {{planning}} {{is a difficult}} and widely studied problem in robotics. Current research aims not only to find feasible paths, but to ensure paths have certain properties, e. g., shortest or safest paths. This is difficult for current stateof-the-art sampling-based techniques as they typically focus on simply finding any path. Despite this difficulty, samplingbased techniques have shown great success in planning {{for a wide range}} of applications. Among such planners, Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) search the planning space by biasing exploration toward unexplored regions. This paper introduces a novel RRT variant, Medial Axis RRT (MARRT), which biases tree exploration to the medial axis of free space by pushing all configurations from expansion steps towards the medial axis. We prove that this biasing increases the tree’s <b>clearance</b> from <b>obstacles.</b> Improving <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance</b> is useful where path safety is important, e. g., path planning for robots performing tasks in close proximity to the elderly. Finally, we experimentally analyze MARRT, emphasizing its ability to effectively map difficult passages while increasing <b>obstacle</b> <b>clearance,</b> and compare it to contemporary RRT techniques.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{goal of this}} project is to improve warhead lethality for use in quick, precise and accurate strikes on known enemy naval minefields in the littoral combat environment. To do so, the Bomb Maneuvering Model for <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Clearance</b> (i. e., STRIKE 35) has being developed to predict the bomb movement and orientation in air, water, and sediment columns during an amphibious assault.
