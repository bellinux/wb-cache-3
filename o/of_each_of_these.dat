5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E

5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E

At regular intervals the national prototypes were compared with and recalibrated against the international prototype.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E

5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E
5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 1950, Monson {{became an}} LDS bishop at age 22, serving {{for five years}} in two wards. He had {{previously}} served as ward clerk, ward Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association superintendent. At the time, Monson's Salt Lake City ward contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly, and he continued visiting to these widows after completing his service as bishop. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself. Monson eventually spoke at the funerals <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> women. Also during his time as bishop, 23 men from his ward served in the Korean War. He wrote weekly personal letters to each serviceman. At {{least one of these}} men became fully involved with the church as a result of Monson's communication. During his service as bishop of the 6th-7th Ward, sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled.|$|E
5|$|Otaku {{subculture}} is {{a central}} theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of otaku traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, {{after the release of}} works such as Mobile Suit Gundam before it branched into Comic Market. The definition of otaku subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of otaku emerged. In 2005, the Nomura Research Institute divided otaku into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single otaku interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, idol and electronics otaku. The economic impact of otaku has been estimated to be as high as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion).|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E

5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social Darwinism, which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E
5|$|The first Kanon manga {{illustrated}} by Petit Morishima was serialized in MediaWorks' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate tankōbon volumes published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Comics imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002. There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume {{one and the}} epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is {{in most of the}} scenes Yuichi is in.
