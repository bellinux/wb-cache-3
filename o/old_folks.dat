As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about.

As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together.

In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau claimed that Morrison had finally fulfilled his artistic potential: [...] "Forget Astral Weeks—this is a brilliant, catchy, poetic, and completely successful LP." [...] Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in Rolling Stone, hailing it {{as a work of}} [...] "musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of 'Into the Mystic' and the fine, epic brilliance of 'Caravan' will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years." [...] Fellow Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau found the singer's vocals overwhelming: [...] "Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it." [...] Ralph J. Gleason from the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote of Morrison's singing as a focal point of praise: [...] "He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the <b>old</b> <b>folks</b> in every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines." ...|$|E

[...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals.

2500|$|In 1964 {{he moved}} to Santa Monica, California, and formed Rising Sons with fellow blues rock {{musician}} Ry Cooder and Jessie Lee Kincaid, landing a record deal with Columbia Records soon after. The group {{was one of the}} first interracial bands of the period, which likely made them commercially unviable. An album was never released (though a single was) and the band soon broke up, though Legacy Records did release The Rising Sons Featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder in 1993 with material from that period. During this time Mahal was working with others, musicians like Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Muddy Waters. Mahal stayed with Columbia after the Rising Sons to begin his solo career, releasing the self-titled Taj Mahal in 1968, The Natch'l Blues in 1969, and Giant Step/De <b>Old</b> <b>Folks</b> at Home with Kiowa session musician Jesse Ed Davis from Oklahoma, who played guitar and piano (also in 1969). During this time he and Cooder worked with the Rolling Stones, with whom he has performed at various times throughout his career. In 1968, he performed in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He recorded a total of twelve albums for Columbia from the late 1960s into the 1970s. His work of the 1970s was especially important, in that his releases began incorporating West Indian and Caribbean music, jazz and reggae into the mix. In 1972, he acted in and wrote the film score for the movie Sounder, which starred Cicely Tyson. [...] He reprised his role and returned as composer in the sequel, Part 2, Sounder.|$|E
