5|$|An attack {{started on}} 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and {{reportedly}} coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought {{the fall of}} the capital on 16 December.

The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, {{the capital of}} Egypt was moved with different cultures through multiple locations {{up and down the}} Nile, such as Thebes and Memphis, depending on which dynasty was in power. After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt around 331 BC, the capital became the city named for him, Alexandria, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> coast. This situation remained stable for nearly a thousand years. After the army of the Arabian Caliph Umar captured the region in the 7th century, shortly after the death of Muhammad, he wanted to establish a new capital. When Alexandria fell in September 641, Amr ibn al-As, the commander of the conquering army, founded a new capital on the eastern bank of the river.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid {{troops in}} Palestine.

These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and who feared that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.|$|E

5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
5|$|Operation Badr, an Egyptian {{military}} operation, had {{the objective}} of crossing the Suez Canal and seizing the Bar Lev line of fortifications.
