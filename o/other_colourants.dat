40|$|Iridescent colours {{have been}} {{fascinating}} to humans throughout history; they are flashy, shimmering, dynamic, and examples surround us, from the commonly seen iridescent sheen of oily street puddles to the exotic, gaudy displays of birds-of-paradise featured in nature documentaries. Iridescent colours and the structures that produce them have unique properties {{in comparison with}} <b>other</b> types of <b>colourants</b> found in nature. Scientists {{from a variety of}} disciplines study the optics, development, heritability, chemical make-up, origin, evolution, functions and biomimetic technological applications of naturally occurring iridescent colours. For the first time, graduate students at Arizona State University brought together these scientists, along with educators and artists, at ‘Iridescence: more than meets the eye’, a conference to promote interdisciplinary communication and collaboration in the study of iridescent coloration from all of these perspectives. Here, we summarize the outcomes of this conference, introduce the papers that follow in this special journal issue and briefly review the current status of our understanding of iridescence...|$|R

40|$|The pH, titratable acidities, {{proximate}} {{and mineral}} compositions of two natural colourants and three synthetic colourants were determined. The pH and titratable acidity were determined {{over a period}} of 14 days at 24 h intervals. The natural colourants were the calyxes of Hibiscus sabdariffa (SL) and the stem of Sorghum bicolour (KD), while the synthetic colourants were Egg Yellow (EY), Chocolate Brown (CB) and Dark Orange (DO). The pH of all samples increased as the number of days increased. The pH of SL was considerable lower than that of <b>other</b> <b>colourants</b> in this study (from 1. 6 on day 1 to 2. 7 on day 14) thus suggesting high acidity while the <b>other</b> <b>colourants</b> had basic pH (5. 6 - 6. 2 on day 1 to 7. 4 - 8. 4 on day 14). The natural colourants had higher moisture, lipid, carbohydrate and fibre contents while the synthetic colourants were very high in ash content. The protein contents of the colourants were fairly uniform irrespective of their sources. The synthetic colourants were particularly high in K and Mg while the natural colourants were rich in Ca...|$|E
30|$|Table  1 {{shows the}} results of the {{pigments}} used for the wall paintings in the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall. Only one red dyestuff was found, <b>other</b> <b>colourants</b> are all inorganic. Red lead, red ochre, cinnabar, atacamite, malachite, botallackite, orpiment, yellow ochre, Prussian blue, smalt, azurite, lead white, flame carbons were used. Pigments like smalt, atacamite were found only in the main hall murals, others were used in all murals. The usage of the imported pigments Prussian blue and smalt proves the geographic position of the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall was of crucial importance for trade. Meanwhile, the selective application of smalt is in accordance with the high value of the paintings and the important position of the main hall. Lead white was widely used, both as a pigment by itself or as a whitening agent mixed with other pigments. In addition, Prussian blue and botallackite as main components of pigments used in ancient murals in China was not widely reported, so research on the source, application and protection should be carried on. The rest of the pigments identified on the examined samples, represent the common painting materials in China.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{high quality}} of the annatto dye (Bixa orellana L.) and the plethora of {{products}} derived and used from this plant in Pre-Columbian and Colonial times are reflected in numerous etnohistorical writings that were redacted in the New World throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Those manuscripts reveal abundant information about the methods employed with annatto to obtain the dying substances: orelline and bixin, which was classified as a “lesser or false dye ” in the technical manuals published in eighteenth-century in Europe, it is mean, {{as one of the}} many dyes of unstable nature that were so widely employed to obtain different hues from the same colour and reduce costs. On the other hand, the particularly warm and bright colours produced by annatto on mixing with different concentrations of <b>other</b> <b>colourants</b> goes to explain why {{it was one of the}} most appreciated and used dyes in Pre-Columbian and Colonial textile and painting art. The study of the annatto considering the dye tradition in ancient America and Europe, the close lecture on those etnohisto-rical writings, and the chemical-analytical knowledge recently, has made it possible to present this paper, which provides to the specialists in conservation-restoration and history of art an important information and a detailed study about the origin...|$|E
40|$|Two Byzantine VI century manuscripts {{known as}} Vienna Dioskurides and Vienna Genesis, {{held in the}} Aus- trian National Library at Vienna, were {{analysed}} with in situ non-invasive techniques. Raman spectros- copy, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry with optic fibres and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry were used to characterise the palette of these early Middle Ages manuscripts. The analyt- icaI study was performed {{to have a better}} knowledge on the colourants used by ancient miniature paint- ers, a subject known more on the basis of traditional sources (i. e. medieval treatises) than of analytical evidences. Indeed these illuminated manuscripts afe, to the authors' knowledge, among the oldest ever being analysed, so that the coIourants found in them can be considered among the oldest evidences of their use. The main feature of Vienna Dioskurides and Vienna Genesis palettes is their richness, exemplified by the simultaneous presence of gold and ultramarine blue: in Vienna Dioskurides cinnabar is al so presento Information regarding ultramarine blue is surprising, being the analytical evidence of the use of this pre- cious pigment at least three centuries before its use in Western manuscripts, a feature justified {{by the fact that the}} Byzantine Empire was the dominant culture in early Middle Ages in the Mediterranean World. <b>Other</b> <b>colourants</b> include azurite and indigo, red lead, orpiment, red and yellow ochres, while a mixture of blue and yellow colourants, known as vergaut, was used to render green hues. Organic colourants were also used, such as madder and Tyrian purple, the latter employed to dye the parchment of Vienna Genesis...|$|E
30|$|A {{limited amount}} of {{analytical}} data {{is available on the}} techniques and materials used in the murals of the Qing dynasty (1636 – 1911) in China. The Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall (1861 – 1874) is located in Wafangdian on the confluence of two rivers. It has the largest murals in Shaanxi Province. This paper presents the first comprehensive investigation of the painting techniques and materials of the murals in the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall. The analytical methods include polarized light microscopy (PLM), microscopic examination on cross-sections, x-ray fluorescence (XRF), x-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-RS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDX), which have been used to examine the paint layer stratigraphy, plaster layers, the priming layer and inorganic pigments composition. The results show that the carrier was firstly prepared with two levels of coarse layers, which are made of clay, sand and rice straw applied onto the brick wall, and a fine coat layer made of lime, clay, sand and cotton follows. Then a kaolin-pigmented priming layer was painted on the fine coat, which was finally painted with red lead, red ochre, cinnabar, atacamite, malachite, botallackite, orpiment, yellow ochre, Prussian blue, smalt, azurite, lead white and flame carbons on top. The research suggests that the painting materials of the murals of the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall are original and the techniques were well implemented and followed the traditional and standard way in ancient China. But a few details present strong local characteristics, such as using rice straw, cotton and kaolin as original materials which were more convenient to obtain. This study also indicates that only one red dyestuff was found, and the <b>other</b> <b>colourants</b> are all inorganic. Except Prussian blue, smalt and botallackite used in ancient mural in China were less reported, {{and the rest of the}} pigments represent traditional Chinese painting materials. In addition, the usage of the imported pigments Prussian blue and smalt proves that the geographic position of the Five Northern Provinces’ Assembly Hall was of crucial importance for trade.|$|E
