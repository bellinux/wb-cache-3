5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> qualifications.|$|E
5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years a {{persistent}} gap has existed in income and productivity levels between Australia and New Zealand. One possible contributor to the creation of this gap is the different levels <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> knowledge embodied by the workforces of the two countries. This paper analyses the intensity <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> knowledge in different types of employment in the two countries. In order to undertake this analysis, O*NET measures <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>and</b> knowledge and Australian and New Zealand employment data are used. The paper concludes that although the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> intensities <b>of</b> the labour forces in the two countries are broadly similar, they do exhibit some important differences...|$|R

25|$|Due to lack <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> {{education}} as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment.

This can sometimes be licit informal economy or illicit informal economy without working contract or any social security. Some of them are seeking jobs {{at the same time}} and some of those will eventually find jobs in formal economies after gaining some professional skills in informal sectors.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, EMTs are {{certified}} {{according to}} their level of training.

The National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) is a private organization which offers certification exams based on NHTSA education guidelines and has been around since the 1970s. Currently, NREMT exams are used by 46 states as the sole basis for certification at one or more EMT certification levels. A NREMT exam consists <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> patient assessments as well as a written portion.|$|E
25|$|The Council of the European Union Directive 91/439/EEC harmonises the {{categories}} of driving licences among the Member States and establishes two Community driving licence models, one paper version and one plastic card version. It furthermore establishes an obligatory test of knowledge (theory) and a test <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> behaviour (practical) which has to be successfully passed before an individual is offered a driving licence. It also requires an applicant to meet the minimum standards of physical and mental fitness to drive. The directive specifies the minimum ages for driving different types of vehicles, and establishes progressive access in categories A, C, and D, from light vehicles to larger or more powerful vehicles. The directive stipulates that it is mandatory to have the normal residence in the Member State issuing the licence.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people move}} to urban areas {{primarily}} because cities promise more jobs, better schools for poor's children, and diverse income opportunities than subsistence farming in rural areas. For example, in 1995, 95.8% of migrants to Surabaya, Indonesia reported that jobs were their primary motivation for {{moving to the}} city. However, some rural migrants may not find jobs immediately because of their lack <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> the increasingly competitive job markets, which leads to their financial shortage. Many cities, on the other hand, do not provide enough low-cost housing for {{a large number of}} rural-urban migrant workers. Some rural–urban migrant workers cannot afford housing in cities and eventually settle down in only affordable slums. Further, rural migrants, mainly lured by higher incomes, continue to flood into cities. They thus expand the existing urban slums.|$|E

25|$|A set <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> {{scope of}} {{practice}} may define {{a primary care}} physician, generally including basic {{diagnosis and treatment of}} common illnesses and medical conditions. Diagnostic techniques include interviewing the patient to collect information on the present symptoms, prior medical history and other health details, followed by a physical examination. Many PCPs are trained in basic medical testing, such as interpreting results of blood or other patient samples, electrocardiograms, or x-rays. More complex and time-intensive diagnostic procedures are usually obtained by referral to specialists, with special training with a technology or increased experience and patient volume that make a risky procedure safer for the patient. After collecting data, the PCP arrives at a differential diagnosis and, with the participation of the patient, formulates a plan including (if appropriate) components of further testing, specialist referral, medication, therapy, diet or life-style changes, patient education, and follow up results of treatment.|$|E
25|$|The role of U.S. General David Petraeus {{and others}} in Iraq {{suggests}} a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord. Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and Power Point presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost. Another factor is that civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack {{the skills needed to}} manage military forces. Yet proconsuls are at best an ad hoc solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the skill}} system is freeform, certain {{combinations}} <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment {{is known as}} an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and augmented/virtual reality monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their brains to achieve fine control over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In Fourth Edition, with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; {{they also tend to}} take over the rigger's role.|$|E
