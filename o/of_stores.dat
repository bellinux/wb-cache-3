5|$|During 1976, {{construction}} of a new shopping center directly across the street from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the Galleria Edina, an upscale shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring shopping centers. In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain <b>of</b> <b>stores,</b> which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E

Partial Least Squares (PLS) {{analysis was conducted}} on the responses collected from 288 retail shoppers. The study found that there was a partial support for the relationship between the perception <b>of</b> <b>store</b> atmosphere and optimum stimulation level (OSL); the perception <b>of</b> <b>store</b> quality was strongly associated with that <b>of</b> <b>store</b> atmosphere; store patronage satisfaction was strongly affected by the perception <b>of</b> <b>store</b> quality; and there was a relationship between repatronage intention and store patronage satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} various aspects <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image, which affect the {{impression}} and preferences of shoppers. It {{argues that the}} levels of customer preferences {{determine the influence of}} the setting <b>of</b> the <b>store</b> on its image. Studying customer perceptions on store image further enhances the knowledge of marketers;marketers can use this knowledge in acquiring more loyal customers and meeting their requirements in terms <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image. This study identifies the factors that are deemed {{to be the most important}} by customers and provides marketers with awareness regarding the psychological elements of customers that influence their perception <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image. A survey was conducted on customers in shopping malls to identify the effects of the principal factors <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image on customer perception. This study used path analysis as the principal analytical tool for conducting causal evaluations and investigated the significant effects <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image attributes (i. e., storeatmosphere, music, merchandise quality, service, price, and convenience) on customer perceptions. Results indicated that the perceptions of customers integrate all of the cues and messages they have received and experienced in the store, in addition to their own perceptions of the importance <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image dimensions. This study investigates the effect of the significant factors <b>of</b> <b>store</b> image on customer perception in the Malaysian context...|$|R

With the original objective yet to be achieved, the priority for the Allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads. During the course of June 7, while still under sporadic shellfire, the beach was prepared as a supply area.

5|$|Additionally, 13lumber vessels were beached. A 30mile (48km) {{portion of}} the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad was washed away. A {{passenger}} train was blown over 100yards from the track, injuring many passengers. Many boats at the harbor and the wharfs in Lanark were wrecked. The local summer resort of Lanark Inn was blown into the Gulf of Mexico. Large portions <b>of</b> <b>stores</b> and pavilions in the city were damaged. At McIntyre, virtually the entire town was destroyed, except for only two mill boilers. The city of Curtis Mill was completely destroyed. Additionally, the resort city of St. Teresa suffered significant damage. A total of fifteen ships either destroyed or beached at Dog Island, including the Benjamin C. Cromwell and James A. Garfield.

5|$|After the war, the 2/15th {{remained}} on Brunei until November when it moved to Mempakul as personnel {{were returned to}} Australia in drafts based on priority of discharge. A small group of personnel volunteered {{at this time to}} undertake occupation duties in Japan and were subsequently transferred to the 66th or 67th Battalions. In early December, the battalion's vehicles were returned and after the appropriate clearances were received, the remaining cadre was transported to Labuan. From there, they sailed back to Australia aboard the Pachaug Victory, arriving at Brett's Wharf, in Brisbane on 19 December. The cadre moved into a camp at Chermside, where they completed unloading <b>of</b> <b>stores</b> and equipment before a short Christmas leave. Early in the new year, the final administrative tasks were completed and the last group of personnel were posted for demobilisation and discharge. Finally, the 2/15th was officially disbanded on 21 January 1946.|$|E
5|$|By August {{the plan}} was already behind schedule: severe {{shortages}} <b>of</b> <b>stores</b> and wages slowed work at the Brest shipyards, while the troops {{set aside for the}} invasion of Cornwall proved unreliable, deserting in large numbers. A practice voyage of the Cornish invasion fleet ended in total failure, as the small ships intended for the operation proved unable to operate in open water. The plan was dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland expeditionary force and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had to shelter from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the expeditionary force had departed.|$|E
5|$|By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, {{and aimed}} to {{increase}} the number <b>of</b> <b>stores</b> by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country store setting, with good service and country music. The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.|$|E

During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time.
