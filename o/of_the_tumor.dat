5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|A biopsy by fine needle aspiration, often {{guided by}} {{endoscopic}} ultrasound, {{may be used}} where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a histologic diagnosis is not usually required for removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> by surgery to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor,</b> which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|Mixed carcinomas {{are those}} that have both Type I and Type II cells, with one making up at least 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor.</b> These include the {{malignant}} mixed Müllerian tumor, which derives from endometrial epithelium and has a poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor.</b> About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E

5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E

25|$|Recently, tumor {{growth has}} been studied using {{mathematics}} and continuum mechanics. Vascular tumors (formed from blood vessels) are thus looked at as being amalgams of a solid skeleton formed by sticky cells and an organic liquid filling the spaces in which cells can grow. Under this type of model, mechanical stresses and strains {{can be dealt with}} and their influence on the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> and the surrounding tissue and vasculature elucidated. Recent findings from experiments that use this model show that active growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> is restricted to the outer edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor,</b> and that stiffening of the underlying normal tissue inhibits tumor growth as well.|$|E
25|$|Biopsies are {{invasive}} {{and associated}} with {{risks to the}} patient. Therefore, multiple biopsies to monitor disease progression are rare and diagnostic biopsies are relied on for genetic information. This can be problematic because of tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution. Firstly, biopsies only sample one portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor,</b> and because tumors are heterogeneous, this will not cover the full genetic landscape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor.</b> Secondly, after treatment tumors evolve {{and there may be}} new mutations not represented in the diagnostic sample.|$|E

25|$|The {{efficacy}} of cancer treatments is, {{in the initial}} stages of testing, often measured by the ablation fraction of tumor mass (fractional kill). As CSCs form a small proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor,</b> this may not necessarily select for drugs that act specifically on the stem cells. The theory suggests that conventional chemotherapies kill differentiated or differentiating cells, which form the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> but do not generate new cells. A population of CSCs, which gave rise to it, could remain untouched and cause relapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{rationale}} for IORT is {{to deliver a}} high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> and EBRT may allow a repopulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tumor</b> cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.|$|E
