25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of <b>our</b> <b>public</b> schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E

By the end of 1732, there were problems with the management of the theatre, which resulted in the failure of Charles Johnson's Caelia: or, The Perjured Lover on 4 December. The 8 March 1733 Grub-Street Journal seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre's management: [...] "how insufficient the present managers of Drury-lane playhouse are to discharge their trust, as directors of <b>our</b> <b>public</b> entertainments." [...] The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Fenchurch Street station {{suffered}} a negative reputation under public ownership. By {{the end of}} the 1980s, the former LTSR line was carrying over 50,000 passengers a day on a 50-year old infrastructure. The persistent overcrowding and uncleanliness on trains led to it being dubbed [...] "the misery line". In 1989 Sir Robert Reid called the service from Fenchurch Street [...] "wholly unacceptable", while Teresa Gorman, Member of Parliament for Billericay, subsequently called it [...] "one of the disgraces of <b>our</b> <b>public</b> railway service for many years". Between 1982 and 1992 the station was operated by Network SouthEast, one of British Rail's three passenger business sectors, before being handed over to a business unit in preparation for privatisation.|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing <b>our</b> <b>public....</b> Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them... {{but a lot of people}} just don't like it." [...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done." ...|$|E
