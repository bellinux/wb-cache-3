In contrast to the known waveguide <b>level</b> <b>gages,</b> traveltime of acoustic pulses along the waveguide from the radiator to the subsurface layer and back is measured in the <b>level</b> <b>gage</b> under study. Waveguide consists of two acoustically isolated waveguides – the radiating waveguide and the receiving waveguide. Waveguides of zero-order flexural waves and piezoelectric transformers operated at frequency of ∼ 800 kHz are applied. Processing of received signals is performed by microprocessor-based electronic circuit. Measurement uncertainty does not exceed ± 10 mm. Description of the experimental setup and the experimental methodology is provided. The instrument works reliably and does not require introducing corrections of readings when coolant thermal physical properties change. The measurement instrument is intended for application in heat exchanging equipment in thermal and nuclear power generation...|$|R

40|$|At mid-year 1992, {{the liquid}} <b>level</b> <b>gage</b> for Tank 241 -T- 101 {{indicated}} that 6, 000 to 9, 000 gal had leaked. Because {{of the liquid}} level anomaly, Tank 241 -T- 101 was declared an assumed leaker on October 4, 1992. SSTs liquid <b>level</b> <b>gages</b> have been historically unreliable. False readings can occur because of instrument failures, floating salt cake, and salt encrustation. Gages frequently self-correct and tanks show no indication of leak. Tank levels cannot be visually inspected and verified because of high radiation fields. The gage in Tank 241 -T- 101 has largely corrected itself since the mid-year 1992 reading. Therefore, doubt exists that a leak has occurred, or that {{the magnitude of the}} leak poses any immediate environmental threat. While reluctance exists to use valuable DST space unnecessarily, there is a large safety and economic incentive to prevent or mitigate release of tank liquid waste into the surrounding environment. During the assessment of the significance of the Tank 241 -T- 101 liquid <b>level</b> <b>gage</b> readings, Washington State Department of Ecology determined that Westinghouse Hanford Company was not in compliance with regulatory requirements, and directed transfer of the Tank 241 -T- 101 liquid contents into a DST. Meanwhile, DOE directed WHC to examine reasonable alternatives/options for safe interim management of Tank 241 -T- 101 wastes before taking action. The five alternatives {{that could be used to}} manage waste from a leaking SST are: (1) No-Action, (2) In-Tank Stabilization, (3) External Tank Stabilization, (4) Liquid Retrieval, and (5) Total Retrieval. The findings of these examinations are reported in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{industrial}} or automotive dip lubricated gear drives, low <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> {{may be used}} due {{to different}} design requirements or constraints. A variation of the sump <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> affects different working conditions of gears, such as the power loss, the heat generation, and the load-carrying capacity with respect to different types of damage. In particular, reduced <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> decrease the scuffing load capacity of gears because of high bulk temperatures and reduced oil quantity in the gear mesh.

Topic Background Usually, gas stations are equipped with several underground storage tanks for oil, and a corresponding <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> measurement system, through whose flow meter and level meter, can give an updated measurement for such data as volume of oil inflow/outflow and the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the tank according to the tank gage table set beforehand (i. e. the corresponding relationship between height of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and the <b>oil</b> quantity), so as to get changes of the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and quantity...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop an engine <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> {{monitoring}} system that will replace the current dipstick method during vehicle testing for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, Inc. (MBRDNA). Currently, MBRDNA test drivers check the engine <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> twice a day after two eight hour shifts each day. To measure the <b>oil</b> <b>level,</b> the driver parks on a level surface, waits five minutes for the oil to cool, and then manually checks the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> with the dipstick. The goal of this project {{is to have a}} reliable, physical, working prototype that MBRDNA can use for vehicle testing by spring. MBRDNA wants a prototype built {{by the end of this}} year that is capable of reading <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> without the need of a test driver to measure the oil. It is very easy for a driver to get distracted and forget to check the oil at precisely 5 minutes after the engine has been shut off. This leads to inconsistent results. Drivers are also susceptible to reading the dipstick incorrectly due to the small amount of increments on the end of the dip stick that must be read. Occasionally dipsticks will even break because they are not designed to with stand fatigue loading cycles that are seen during this testing. This leads to an expensive engine tear down to recover broken parts out of the crankcase. The prototype will consist of the following features: a SICK fiber optic cable connected to a SICK optic sensor, a clamp, a microcontroller, a digital display and a data acquisition.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|R

In this paper, new scroll compressor which can reduce oil circulation in refrigerant circuit, keep <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the compressor, keep high capacity and performance and operate in a wide running range and can be applied until 16 HP capacity by usage of one compressor was developed. It is important to keep <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in a compressor because VRF system has large refrigerant circuit. Analysis of oil and refrigerant flow in the compressor was applied and structure of preventing oil agitation was introduced to reduce oil circulation in refrigerant circuit and keep <b>oil</b> <b>level.</b> The compressor for VRF system is demanded to operate in a wide running range from low speed to high speed and from low load to high load. This compressor can supply oil even if rotational speed is low because this compressor supplies oil by differential pressure and can supply enough oil at low differential pressure by new structure of oil lubrication, therefore running range become wider. And analysis of lubrication between shaft and bearing was applied and this compressor can keep reliability against high load at large capacity by optimal structure...|$|R
