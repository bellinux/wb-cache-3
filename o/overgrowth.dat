40|$|ABSTRACT: Complex syntaxial <b>overgrowths</b> {{are common}} on many {{dolomite}} crystals {{that line the}} walls of cavities in dolostones of the Bluff Formation exposed along the coastline of Grand Cayman. Scanning Electron Microscopy shows that the siting {{and development of the}} <b>overgrowths,</b> which are initiated on "seed crystals " less than 0. 1 #m long, are predetermined by the crystallographic structure of the host crystal. Based on their three-dimensional form, the <b>overgrowths</b> are divided into i) aggregate rigonal prisms, 2) needle, wall, and sheet <b>overgrowths,</b> and 3) needle crystals. The aggregate rigonal prisms with sides up to 12 #m long, are formed of four orders of crystals. The first order crystals, less than 1 um long, are vertically stacked to form 2 nd order crystals that are commonly capped by multifacetted crystals. The 2 nd order crystals, each maintaining their identity, are arranged in a triangular outline, thereby forming a 3 rd order trigonal prism. Filling the spaces in the 3 rd order crystals creates a "solid " 4 th order crystal. Needle <b>overgrowths</b> are formed of vertically stacked subcrystals (rounded hexagons, 0. 5 to 1. 0 ~m long and 0. 1 #m thick). Lateral merger produces wall <b>overgrowths</b> which in turn merge to form "solid " sheet <b>overgrowths.</b> Such <b>overgrowths,</b> usually 4 to 5 ~zm thick, can occur on all faces of the host dolomite crystal. Needle crystals are non-aggregate, elongate (up to 10 ~m long) crystals that have a round cross section. All the <b>overgrowths</b> occur in near-surface avities that are subjected to daytime temperatures of 27 to 30 "C and periodic influxes of rainwater and seawater.

The magnesium content of the <b>overgrowths</b> estimated from mass balance calculations of carbonate alkalinity of the reacting solutions ($ Delta$Ac) and flame spectrophotometric (AAS) analyses of the reacted solids yield similar results away from the extremes of $P sb{CO sb 2 }$ investigated in this study.

The concentration of sulfate and sodium in the <b>overgrowths,</b> however, appears to correlate with variations in $P sb{CO sb 2 }$. In a separate set of experiments, using the same precipitation technique, the influence of a biogenic seed material on the composition and mineralogy of <b>overgrowths</b> was investigated.

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (<b>overgrowth</b> of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
30|$|In the Farewell {{reservoir}} photomicrographs, {{the main}} cementing agents present are silica and calcite cements. Silica cementation {{is in the}} form of syntaxial quartz <b>overgrowths</b> (Fig.  8 a), a cementing agent feature that binds quartz grains together and effectively reduces existing pore spaces. Quartz <b>overgrowths</b> tend to grow in equant crystal shapes and are separated from detrital grains by a dust rim. They are an important reservoir quality-deteriorating mechanism in many deep petroleum reservoirs (Worden and Morad 2000) and are a major reason for decreasing porosity in many petroleum reservoirs in moderately to deeply buried sandstone reservoirs (Imam 1986; Worden and Morad 2003). In the studied samples, the quartz <b>overgrowths</b> coating the detrital quartz grains results in the reduction of pore diameter and consequently decreases the porosity and permeability. Calcite and quartz cements commonly coexist in sandstones and may show evidence of replacement of one mineral by the other. Changes in pH may cause solution of one phase and precipitation of another (Blatt et al. 1980). The solubility of silica is unaffected by pH values below about 9, whereas calcite is very soluble in acidic solutions. In Fig.  8 c, silica is seen being replaced by calcite cementation. This is indicative of non-acidic conditions in Tui- 1 Well. Feldspar <b>overgrowths</b> are also present in the studied samples shown in Fig.  8 b.|$|R

When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen.

5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause <b>overgrowth</b> of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
5|$|Some researchers, {{as well as}} some timber {{companies}} and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce <b>overgrowth</b> and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems. Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn.|$|E
