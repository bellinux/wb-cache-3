5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Winnipeg {{started in}} 1954. The federal government refused to license any private broadcaster until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{had created a}} national network.

25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Stevens {{recorded}} and toured with an eclectic group of artists ranging from Jimi Hendrix to Engelbert Humperdinck. Stevens was considered a fresh-faced teen star, placing several single releases in the British pop music charts. Some of that success was attributed to the pirate radio station Wonderful Radio London, which gained him fans by playing his records. In August 1967, he went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> other recording artists who had benefited from the station to mourn its closure.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Johnson's death, {{his press}} {{secretary}} Tom Johnson (no relation) telephoned Walter Cronkite at CBS; Cronkite was live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> the CBS Evening News at the time, and {{a report on}} Vietnam was cut abruptly while Cronkite {{was still on the}} line, so he could break the news. Johnson's death came two days after Richard Nixon's second inauguration, which followed Nixon's landslide victory in the 1972 election. His death meant {{that for the first time}} since 1933, when Calvin Coolidge died during Herbert Hoover's final months in office, that there were no former Presidents still living; Johnson had been the only living ex-President since December 26, 1972, following the death of Harry S. Truman.|$|E

500|$|WWV {{was nearly}} {{destroyed}} by a fire on November 6, 1940. The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered, and the station was back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> (<b>with</b> reduced power) on November 11. Congress funded a new station in July 1941, and it was built [...] south of the former location, still referred to as Beltsville (although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to Greenbelt, Maryland). WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2.5, 5, 10, and 15MHz on August 1, 1943.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{creation}} of Dallas, series creator David Jacobs originally had quite a different idea of what he envisioned the show to be. He {{wanted to create a}} television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The Production Company, CBS, initially turned down his original idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>with</b> wealthier characters. After the success of Dallas, Jacobs' initial idea would later become the Dallas spin-off Knots Landing. He initially conceived Pamela as the central character of the Texas-based serial. The role was initially created specifically for actress Linda Evans to star, and was indefinitely called [...] "The Untitled Linda Evans Project" [...] that was originally set in Indianapolis. He described her character as, [...] "a semitrashy lady who marries into a rich Texas family". After crafting the backstory of the Ewing family, Jacobs began to realize that the show couldn't be settled simply around the character of Pamela. He wanted it to be based around the entire clan and their lives as wealthy oil people living in Dallas, Texas. Evans was ultimately not offered the part, but ironically would later go on to play Krystle Carrington on Dynasty, a rival show to Dallas.|$|E

50|$|A Kinect-based game is also {{considered}} {{a part of}} Bemani series, previously being exclusive to Xbox 360. It was released on March 27, 2012.

500|$|In casting Al [...] "Gee" [...] Giardello, Levinson {{decided not}} to make the {{character}} Italian-American like the real-life counterpart Gary D'Addario, but rather cast Yaphet Kotto and made the character a Sicilian-African American. Kotto, who turned down two feature film offers to accept the Homicide role, was extremely impressed with Levinson's choices for the character, saying, [...] "They had the daring to make the artistic choice without prejudice of any kind. I don't think there's another network show <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> this sort of cast composition." [...] Kotto struggled at first with the show's production style and constantly moving camera style, which flustered him and made him forget his lines. Levinson had to personally reassure him that he could handle the part. Clark Johnson was cast as Meldrick Lewis, and Jon Polito as his partner, Steve Crosetti. When Polito first auditioned, he read the role of a Polish cop, then did a second reading for an Irish role based on Detective Sergeant Terrence McLarney. He was cast in the McLarney role, but it was rewritten to an Italian character for Polito. The actor found working on Homicide intense and demanding, claiming, [...] "Everybody's working so hard. This is much more of a theater atmosphere." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese {{started to}} break. The {{struggle}} around the Portuguese royal standard was ferocious: having the flag carrier's (the ensign [...] ) hand cut off, he transferred the standard {{to the remaining}} hand which was also cut off. So he sustained the standard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> his teeth until he fainted under the wounds inflicted by the enemies which surrounded and captured him.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 2003, {{the station}} came back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> an adult {{standards}} music format branded as [...] "Timeless Classics".

2500|$|In the evening, {{after several}} hours, Mali's state {{broadcaster}} ORTM came back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> a brief message displayed {{against a backdrop}} of traditional Malian music and dance. [...] "In a moment, there will be a statement by the military", the message read. A riot broke out at a military garrison near the northern town of Gao, and a military student reportedly said recruits had shot into the air and took several of their senior commanding officers hostage.|$|E
2500|$|About 40 years ago, when I was a snow haired six year old, I can {{remember}} being totally captivated by {{a grown man}} {{pretending to be a}} naughty little boy on 3AW's children session called [...] "Chatterbox Corner". His name was Clifford Whitta, and he was to become the most important man in my life. Years later I was even more fascinated with this man when he conducted a breakfast program and let the boy who played his records actually talk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, {{the fledgling}} ABC Television Network put Morgan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>with</b> On the Corner, which lasted for five weeks.

In 1951, Morgan had a short-lived TV show on NBC, Henry Morgan's Great Talent Hunt, which replaced the NBC variety series Versatile Varieties, and which ran from January 26 to June 1, 1951.
