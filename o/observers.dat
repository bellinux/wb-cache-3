40|$|Recent {{developments}} in optimal <b>observer</b> design for dynamic positioning {{have led to}} application of contraction analysis. In this paper a theoretical method for nonlinear optimal <b>observer</b> design and a suboptimal <b>observer</b> using a state-dependent Riccati equation approach are presented. The <b>observer</b> will be compared to an existing <b>observer</b> and its properties and performance is discussed. Early <b>observer</b> design for dynamic positioning (DP) focussed on applying linear optimal <b>observer</b> theory to the linearized equations of motion. Because of {{the large number of}} free parameters and the lack of global stability, the research area shifted to nonlinear <b>observer</b> design. The drawback of this approach however is that optimality is not guaranteed. Based on recent {{developments in}} the field of contraction theory a theoretical optimal nonlinear <b>observer</b> is presented, yielding, together with a state-dependent Riccati equation approach, a suboptimal <b>observer</b> design. Performance and applicability of this new <b>observer</b> are compared to an existing <b>observer...</b>|$|R

5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that <b>Observers</b> are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other <b>Observers,</b> who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the <b>Observers</b> to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E
