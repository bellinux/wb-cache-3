Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>next</b> assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return.

At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California.
