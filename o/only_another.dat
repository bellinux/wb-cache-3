5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Blois' episcopate comes from his acta, or records; 86 of them survive. There is an early 14th-century {{reference}} to Blois' matricula, which can mean register, list, or list of students, but given the distance in time from when it was recorded to Blois' episcopate, it is unclear what exactly was meant by this. Nor has any such document survived. Blois' acta show him to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non-relatives, with <b>only</b> <b>another</b> William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative.|$|E
5|$|There may {{nonetheless}} be {{a connection}} between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the Chronicle of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of Worcester. Harthacnut reigned <b>only</b> <b>another</b> year, dying on 8 June 1042. He was succeeded by the exiled English ætheling Edward. As an ætheling, a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler. Edward was crowned king on Easter Day, 3 April 1043.|$|E

5|$|The 2009–10 season started poorly, {{with the}} club failing to pay bonuses to former players, as well as £250k owed to Bristol City for the {{transfer}} of Australian international Nick Carle twelve months before. The Football League placed a transfer embargo on the Eagles in early August, which was lifted {{near the end of}} that month. However, it was <b>only</b> <b>another</b> three weeks before a second embargo was put into effect, this time due to an unpaid portion of a transfer fee owed to Ipswich Town for Alan Lee. The financial problems came to a head at the end of January when the club was placed into administration by creditor Agilo Finance, and Brendan Guilfoyle took over the running of the club. Victor Moses departed for Wigan Athletic days later, and Neil Warnock left one month later to take over at Queens Park Rangers. Paul Hart was brought in on a temporary basis to keep the Eagles up, with Dougie Freedman and John Pemberton both returning to the club they played for as assistant and coach respectively. Before administration, the Eagles appeared to be building towards a run for the play-offs, but the ten-point deduction for going into administration turned the season into a battle against relegation. Survival was only achieved on the final day, with a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, who went down to League One instead of Palace. Following the end of the season, Freedman took over as caretaker manager and the club emerged from administration owned by a consortium of wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.|$|E

Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum. Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott and Jay S. Walker.|$|E
25|$|Born in Northfield, Birmingham, Byrne {{made his}} debut for Warwickshire against Middlesex in late July 1912, {{returning}} figures of 3-9 (which were to remain his career best) {{in the first}} innings; two of these wickets came in his first over, his first victim being future Test batsman Frank Mann.

His batting was feeble, and in all of 1912 he scored only 36 runs in 12 innings for a batting average of a mere 3.00. He also took the only catch of his entire career, to dismiss Sussex opener Robert Relf off the bowling of Willie Quaife.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the release}} of the film, Tashan {{received}} an advance booking, which ranged from 25-35% tickets sold for the weekend at the major centres. On the day of its release, the film opened to a 75-80% response but well short of the expected bumper opening due to the multiplex revenue sharing problem, which didn't allow the film to be released in major multiplexes across India. Due to this, the film lost a major chunk of its revenue and collected a total of 180million after its first week. Although the following week, an agreement was made between Yash Raj Films and the multiplexes, which allowed the film to be screened from 3 May 2008 onwards at multiplexes across the country, the film managed to add <b>only</b> <b>another</b> 70million to its collections and was declared a below average.|$|E

In his debut season, Dailly managed five goals in eighteen appearances. His debut season would become his most prolific, and the 1991–92 season brought just eight games with no goals. In the 1992–93 season, Dailly scored four from fourteen appearances and firmly established himself as a regular in the 1993–94 season with 38 league appearances, and not <b>only</b> <b>another</b> four goals, but also the Scottish Cup, when his shot rebounded off the post for Craig Brewster to score the only goal against Rangers.|$|E

England replied with 325 {{and were asked to}} {{follow-on}} 261 behind. They made 437 to set Australia a target of only 177. Australia reached 113–2 at close of play, needing <b>only</b> <b>another</b> 64. Rain fell overnight, and Australia allowed play to be delayed for 20 minutes as a couple of England players, including slow left-arm spinner Bobby Peel had not reached the ground on time because they were hungover. Australia fell 10 short, with Peel taking 6 wickets and Briggs 3 on a pitch that had been made helpful by the rain. This was the first time a side following-on had won a Test match.|$|E

25|$|Corsicans were notorious in Rome {{for their}} {{tendency}} to engage in fights and brawls, and the soldiers of the guard were no exception. Under the reign of UrbanVIII, on April21, 1642, Easter Monday, a fight broke out among Corsican soldiers and the Corazze ("cuirasses"), another Papal corps composed almost exclusively of men from Bologna, who were quartered at the slope of S. Onofrio on the Gianicolo hill. Two Corsicans died, and only the intervention of Cardinal-Nephew Francesco Barberini, who approached from nearby St. Peter's Basilica, {{put an end to}} the fight. The Corsicans did not give up, and during the following days fights broke out at Via della Lungara, Tor di Nona and Castel Sant'Angelo. Merchants and shopkeepers in Via dei Coronari and the surrounding lanes of rione Ponte were forced to barricade themselves, fearing the sacking of their homes and shops. In the end, <b>only</b> <b>another</b> intervention by Cardinal Barberini and many soldiers on May2 ended the fights. On the following day, gallows were set up near the hospital of Santo Spirito, in Borgo, and seven Corsican soldiers were hanged. Another one, who had killed a wounded corazza while a friar of Sant'Agostino was confessing him, was executed by hitting his head with a mallet.|$|E
