25|$|Italy is {{the first}} largest {{producer}} of wine in the world, {{and one of the}} leading in olive <b>oil,</b> <b>fruits</b> (apples, olives, grapes, oranges, lemons, pears, apricots, hazelnuts, peaches, cherries, plums, strawberries and kiwifruits), and vegetables (especially artichokes and tomatoes). The most famous Italian wines are probably the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Other famous wines are Barbaresco, Barbera d'Asti, Brunello di Montalcino, Frascati, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Morellino di Scansano, and the sparkling wines Franciacorta and Prosecco. Quality goods in which Italy specialises, particularly the already mentioned wines and regional cheeses, are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP. This geographical indication certificate, which is attributed by the European Union, is considered important in order to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-produced ersatz products.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, an {{automated}} fruit grading system has gained much attention since the technologies in upgrading {{the quality of}} food products are now acknowledged. This also includes the palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> sector. Palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> or Elaeis guineensis, is a species of palm that commonly called African oil palm, which is the principal source of palm oil [1]. They are used in commercial agriculture {{in the production of}} palm oil (which is the most widely traded edible oil in the world [2]) and the palm oil itself can be used to produce other food products. The technology in the palm oil industry has grown in parallel with the increase in production. However, some tasks in palm oil processing require skilled labor so that the tasks run smoothly and can increase the production. Normally, in some developing countries such as Malaysia, the palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> grading is done manually by the labor or grader. However, at a certain time, grading mistakes can be occurred. This is because of the human’s eyes perceive colors differently and this often lead to dispute between graders and sellers. There might be inefficiencies and time-consuming using this method. In this paper, the palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> maturity grading system using computer vision technique is presented. The palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> bunch images are categorized into three classes which are under-ripe, ripe and unripe. A palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> is said to be ripe when the mesocarp color is reddish orange and the bunch has 10 or more empty sockets of detached fruitless. Another category which is under-ripe fruit bunch, it has yellowish orange with less than 10 empty sockets, while an unripe bunch has yellow mesocarp with no empty sockets [3]. A total of 90 images of <b>oil</b> palm <b>fruit</b> bunch (which 30 images for each group) are used for the system simulation. All <b>oil</b> palm <b>fruit</b> bunch images that were used in this experiment had been taken at Felda Kemahang Oil Mill, Pahang. The image acquisition process was supervised by experienced and skilled grader. Images of <b>oil</b> palm <b>fruit</b> bunch were taken using a digital camera under direct sunlight...|$|R

This research {{was carried out}} to find the effect of soaking palm oil fiber in filtrated palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> bunch ash (FPOFBA) on in vitro digestibility. This experiment used a completely randomized design that repeated for 4 times. Palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruit</b> bunch ash was mixed in water and entered into container for 24 hours within concentrations, consists of: 50, 100, 150 and 200 g/L. Moreover, this filtrate used to soak palm oil fiber for 3 hours. The processed products were analyzed for their level of lignin and crude fiber.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Palm oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} agricultural products in the areas of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and South America, which plays a crucial role in economic development. Maturity or ripeness of the palm <b>oil</b> <b>fruits</b> commands the quality, as well as the overall marketing of palm oil produced.
