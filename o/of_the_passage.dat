40|$|This {{research}} study considered <b>the</b> readability indexes <b>of</b> reading passages in English textbooks taught at Iranian senior high schools. For measuring <b>the</b> readability indexes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages,</b> 30 English passages were {{fed into the}} computer and Flesch readability indexes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were estimated. This study also examined students’ prior knowledge-interest levels to see to what extent students were interested or had background knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> in their English textbooks. 120 participants including 60 males and 60 females {{took part in the}} study and completed a Likert-type scale questionnaire. Other issues that were analyzed in the study were the association between students’ interest level and their background knowledge level, and the relationship between students’ interest- background knowledge levels with <b>the</b> readability indexes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study indicated that <b>the</b> readability indexes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> in high school English textbooks did not accord with Flesch readability standard. The results also showed that students mostly had an average and a low level of interest and background knowledge regarding reading passages in their English text books. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study revealed a significant relationship between students’ interest level and their background knowledge level. This study also showed an insignificant relationship between students’ interest level and <b>the</b> readability indexes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> in books two, three and four while based on Flesch readability formula there was a significant relationship between these two variables in book one. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study revealed an insignificant relationship between students’ background knowledge level and <b>the</b> readability indexes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages.</b> </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one at either end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage,</b> and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections {{on either side of the}} gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E

5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors.

His father met Vera Congehl earlier that year, and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934. Bethe did not find the work in Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper, Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie ("The Theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Passage</b> of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter"). Starting from Max Born's interpretation of the Schrödinger equation, Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a Fourier transform, which is known today as the Bethe formula.

5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because of obstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of}} the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> is unclear.
