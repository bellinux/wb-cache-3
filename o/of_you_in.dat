500|$|In 1834 {{a second}} edition was {{published}} {{under the name}} Les Chouans ou La Bretagne en 1799. It had been heavily revised, as per Balzac's style of constantly reworking texts, even after their release. He had been corresponding with Ewelina Hańska, who wrote to him anonymously in 1832. In an attempt to please her, he changed some of the language in Les Chouans for its second edition. [...] "If only you knew," [...] he wrote to her, [...] "how much there is <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> every altered phrase of Chouans!" [...] The second edition also demonstrates the author's maturing political philosophy (softening his representation of the royalists), and the evolved female characters testify to his relationship with Hańska.|$|E

They've undermined the credibility and confidence that people have, for example in science, dealing with climate." [...] He also spoke about the importance of evidence-based decision making. In her speech, Bonamici said science should not be a partisan issue, and told the crowd: [...] "We are {{going to go back to}} Washington, D.C., with all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> our mind [...] this beautiful sea of science supporters, and fight for research, fight for science, fight for clean air, fight for clean water, and fight for our planet.

500|$|Qur’ān verse 49:13 states: [...] "O humankind! We {{have created}} {{you out of}} male and female and {{constituted}} you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā." [...] In Islam, according to eminent theologians such as Al-Ghazali, although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the Preserved Tablet), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the Five Pillars of Islam, deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts. Marshall Hodgson wrote the three-volume work: The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} The Mikado, Bond met Lewis Ransome, a young civil {{engineer}} from a wealthy Quaker family. [...] He {{had just returned from}} America, and the two compared travel experiences. Ransome admitted to Bond that, after watching The Mikado, he had mentioned to his sister that he [...] "liked the little one with the big sash best. So next day when she saw a photograph <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a shop window she went in and bought it. She gave it to me and I have it now." [...] Thus, despite Bond's aversion to romance, began a long friendship that led, twelve years later, to Bond's second marriage. Ransome, several years younger than Bond, proposed marriage on many occasions {{over the course of the}} relationship, but Bond told him that she would not marry while she continued on the stage. Over the years, the two spent many of Bond's days off (Sundays) relaxing together in the country.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really good actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E

500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few of the}} Robinsons {{actually}} {{tried to}} actively take revenge on the occupying forces. The most famous of these, who became a local legend, was an individual known only as [...] "Ares" [...] (after the Greek god of war), described by Gluth-Nowowiejski, {{based on interviews with}} the Robinsons he conducted. Ares, active in the Śródmieście district, staged numerous ambushes of German soldiers, in at least one case using an improvised explosive device. According to Gluth-Nowowiejski's sources, he would leave behind graffiti of his name, as well as slogans such as [...] "Hitler kaput". Other messages included communications to the German soldiers. In one case he dumped a body of a soldier he had killed with the note: [...] "This awaits all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> Warsaw". In another he wrote: [...] "Ares is a ghost, not matter – your search for him is useless". Eventually, Ares met his demise when the Germans left some poisoned food for him to find. Soon they discovered a man in the ruins who was obviously sick from having eaten it. He shot at them before taking his own life. According to some sources, other individuals took on Ares' struggle but used the names of other Greek Gods as their signature.|$|E

2500|$|The third quatrain {{sets up the}} {{decision}} to be made about this 'battle'. Line 9-10 explains that deciding this legal right of possession requires a jury of thoughts and these thoughts are all tenants of the heart. The jury decides the verdict and what share (moiety) the clear eye and dear heart will receive. The rhyming couplet offers the final decision. Author G. Blackmore Evans believes the 'outward part' refers to the external physical beauty; the eyes are granted the exercise of their physical attribute of sight. According to Evans, the 'right' of the heart perhaps suggests the 'natural right' making it a stronger word and emphasizing {{the superiority of the}} heart's claim: [...] "'thy inward love of heart' is the spiritual/mental love of your heart and is a 'part' <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> value far beyond the 'due' accorded to the eyes because it is the 'essential' you, not merely the 'appearance'." ...|$|E

In Spain it is different, some people hate me, many <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> this [...] room." [...] Mourinho's fraught relationships with Sergio Ramos and club captain Iker Casillas (a popular player whom Mourinho sidelined in 2013) caused divisions between fans in the [...] "Mourinhistas" [...] and [...] "Madridistas" [...] (the more traditional Real Madrid fans) camps. His relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo became difficult because, according to Mourinho, the player [...] "maybe thinks that he knows everything and that the coach cannot improve him anymore", so was unwilling to accept constructive criticism. Mourinho was also criticised for controversial incidents, including poking Tito Vilanova (then assistant coach at Barcelona) in the eye during a brawl, continual complaints about refereeing bias, clashes with journalists and Real officials, and frequent hints that Barça received favourable treatment from UEFA.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the looming}} PNL threat, Pogor, {{who had also}} been reelected {{chairman}} of the Iași appellate court, and N. Gane were absentee deputies, and were probably convinced that the Catargiu cabinet was about to crumble. Maiorescu, the acting Minister of Education and proponent of an unpopular education reform, was perplexed by their decision: [...] "Gane and Pogor should present themselves in Bucharest immediately ! Are we going to engage in politics or not? Is there any solidarity between those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> Iași and me?" [...] Their effective abandon contributed to Maiorescu's resignation in January 1876, then to the arrival in power of a PNL ministry, surprisingly headed by the formerly ultra-"White" [...] Epureanu. The Junimists were soundly defeated in the subsequent elections of July 1876. Pogor managed to preserve his seat in the new legislature, which voted on Romanian independence during the War of '77. He was thus involved in parliamentary discussions about the thorny issue of antisemitic discrimination favored by the PNL: in early 1878, {{he was one of}} the few deputies who questioned the law preventing Romanian Jews from trading in distilled beverages.|$|E
