The first study examined the {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) used by students and how adequately these met their on and off campus needs, and the second study explored the accessibility of e-learning at the post-secondary level, including which e-learning tools participants find most and least accessible. The findings indicate that several e-learning tools, such as PDF documents and web-based content, pose a number of accessibility problems. Moreover, the results suggest that participants encounter problems when using ICTs at home and at school, such as ICTs not being adequately up-to-date. We present these findings and provide recommendations to address these concerns, such as the need to ensure that universal design and web-accessibility guidelines are considered when e-learning tools are implemented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{reports on}} the ability of {{observers}} who are sighted and those with <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> to make time-to-collision (TTC) estimations using video. The TTC estimations made by the observers with <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> were comparable to those made by the sighted observers, and both groups made underestimation errors that were similar to those that were previously reported in the literature. For the pedestrian who is visually impaired (that is, is blind <b>or</b> <b>has</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision),</b> walking [...] which is fundamental to independent mobility, both for travel and for access to public transportation, is a precarious activity. Accounting for a third of all trips in the United Kingdom and approximately 80 % of all journeys of less than a mile, walking is a significant mode of transportation for visually impaired people (Royal National Institute of the Blind, RNIB, 2002). The gauntlet of obstacles that these pedestrians face includes poorly maintained pavements, illegally parked vehicles, street signs, garbage cans, advertisement boards, and other pedestrians. Unexpected contact with obstacles is the most significant issue for independent travel by pedestrians who are visually impaired (North, 2000). The dangers and risks of contact with obstacles are exacerbated when they are coupled with inadequate street lighting (RNIB, 2002) and objects with poor contrast (McNamara & Banim, 1996). Gallon, Fowkes, and Edwards (1995) surveyed 300 people with visual impairments and reported that all had experienced accidents and more than half had sustained injuries while walking...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the potential relationship of accessible hands-on science learning experiences {{to the development of}} positive beliefs concerning one’s capacity to function in the sciences and motivation to consider science as a college major and career. Findings from Likert survey items given before and after engaging in accessible hands-on science laboratories show that students who were blind <b>or</b> <b>had</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> (BLV) were more likely to agree with the following items after engaging in accessible science experiences: 1) I plan on enrolling as a science major in college; 2) My educational experiences, so far, have given me the confidence that I need to decide on majoring in an area of science in college and then a career in science; 3) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently perform a lab activity in (on) ______; 4) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently start data collection during a lab activity in ______; 5) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently stop data collection on a lab activity in ______; 6) I was actively involved in data collection during the______ lab. The Likert survey findings are consistent with the notion that accessible science activities may foster the development of self-beliefs that one has the capacity to independently function in scientific domains, which may promote an inclination to consider scientific pursuits. Insufficient accessible science learning experiences may contribute to the underrepresentation of individuals with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Providing accessible science learning activities may help to increase both the number of individuals who have disabilities and diversity in the STEM fields...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the cataract surgical coverage and investigate the barriers to cataract surgery as reported by those with cataract-induced visual impairment in rural Myanmar. Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based survey of inhabitants 40 years of age and over from villages in the Meiktila District (central Myanmar); 2481 eligible participants were identified and 2076 participated. Data recording included corrected visual acuity, dilated slit lamp examination and stereoscopic fundus examination. Lens opacity was graded using the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Participants with cataract-induced visual impairment (acuity < 6 / 18 in better eye) were also invited to respond to a verbal questionnaire about barriers to cataract surgery. Results: Cataract surgical coverage for visual acuity cut-offs of < 6 / 18, < 6 / 60 and < 3 / 60 was 9. 74 %, 20. 11 % and 22. 3 %, respectively, for people and 4. 18 %, 9. 39 % and 13. 47 %, respectively, for eyes. Cataract surgical coverage was higher for men than women, but gender was not associated with refusal of services. Of the 239 who responded to the extra questionnaire, 216 were blind <b>or</b> <b>had</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> owing to cataract. Three quarters refused referral for surgery: cost and fear of surgery were the most frequently reported barriers. Conclusion: Cost plays a large role in the burden of cataract in this region. Implementation of educational programmes, reforms to local health service and subsidization of ophthalmic care may improve the uptake of cataract surgery.

The school added the [...] "and Visually Impaired" [...] {{to its name}} in 2007 and continues to use it today, despite [...] "students {{who are blind or}} have low vision" [...] being the currently accepted term. Students are able to attend the school from pre-school to high school, up to age 22. The current student population is estimated between 150 and 175 students; there are also an equal number of educators, maintenance, outreach, administrators and residential staff. The current superintendent of ISBVI, James Durst, does not actually hold valid Indiana licensure to be a superintendent [...] and is therefore officially the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the school instead. The Lions Clubs of Indiana support the institution as one of their state projects through monetary donations and volunteerism.

It also investigates whether they believe they experience a gap in their knowledge of news {{as a result of their}} level of news access. Using semi-structured interviews and observation sessions with 14 mid-Missouri residents who are blind <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> the researcher discovered that many do not regularly use traditional news websites, often because of accessibility or usability problems. Instead, they tend to get news through other online and offline platforms. Subjects overall said they do not think they experience a knowledge gap, although anecdotes and observations revealed some problems. The 14 interviews yielded a list of suggested improvements to online news delivery. These were supplemented with interviews with six professionals who offered more insight into those improvements. The population of people who are blind <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> is not small, and the people interviewed for this study showed that they are generally an interested, engaged news audience.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{reliability}} and validity of the 51 -item Field Test Version of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) across 5 common chronic eye conditions. Design: Prospective observational cohort study of persons with 1 of 5 chronic eye diseases who were scheduled for nonurgent visits in ophthalmology practices <b>or</b> <b>had</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> from any cause, and a reference sample of persons without eye disease. Setting: Six university-based ophthalmology practices and the National Eye Institute Clinical Center, Bethesda, Md. Patients: Eligible participants had to have 1 of the following eye conditions: age-related cataracts, age- related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, primary open-angle glaucoma, cytomegalovirus retinitis, or <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> from any cause. Each of the 7 sites also enrolled persons in a reference sample. Reference sample participants had no evidence of underlying eye disease but were scheduled for either screening eye examinations or correction of refractive error. All eligible persons had to be aged 21 years or older, English speaking, and cognitively able to give informed consent and participate in a health status interview. Measurements and Main Results: To provide the data needed to assess {{the reliability and}} validity of the 51 -item NEI-VFQ, all subjects completed an interview that consisted of the 51 -item NEI-VFQ, the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey, and at least 1 measure of vision-targeted functional status. Estimates of internal consistency and test-retest reproducibility indicate that the 51 -item NEI-VFQ is reliable. Tests of association with other scales and clinical variables support the construct validity of the survey. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, the 51 -item NEI-VFQ seems to be reliable and valid and should be a useful tool for group-level comparisons of vision-targeted, health-related quality of life in clinical research. Additionally, the psychometric properties of the NEI-VFQ were not influenced by the type or severity of the underlying eye disease, suggesting that the measure will provide reproducible and valid data when used across multiple eye conditions...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{probable}} significance of tactile or haptic (Gibson, 1966) capacities {{in the early}} development {{of children who are}} blind <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> (Bigelow, 1990; Fraiberg, 1977; Hatwell, 1978), there are still many unanswered questions regarding the emergence of such capacities. A centraI issue in this respect is {{the nature and extent of}} children's memory of haptic features. Although there is evidence that blind preschoolers (Ungar, Blades, Spencer, & Morsley, 1994) and older children (Pathak & Pring, 1989) are able to retain information from tactile maps and two-dimensional displays, there has been little research on the age at which such memory abilities begin in children who are blind <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and few studies of memory for three-dimensional objects. There is evidence that blind infants show a poor spontaneous response to such objects in the naturalistic environment (Fraiberg, 1977), but this does not necessarily mean that the haptic features of objects could not be retained if infants were to engage in exploratory behavior. A promising tool for addressing these issues is habituation or familiarization, a procedure that has been successfully used to investigate haptic memory in sighted infants (Catherwood, 1993 a, 1993 b; Gottfried & Rose, 1980; Streri & P echeux, 1986). Variants of this procedure have been used to confirm that infants as young as 4 months are able to recognize objects on the basis of features, such as shape or texture, that have been experienced only through haptic means. In such procedures, infants are either repeatedly presented with or allowed to explore one item and then presented with "test" trials involving the re-presentation of this familiar item, as well as "novel" items that differ in one or more features from the familiar item. The essential premise is that if the infants display more exploratory interest in the novel items than in the familiar item (in terms of longer manipulation time), it suggests that the familiar item has been discriminated from the novel items or recognized on the basis of the feature or features in which the novel and familiar items differ (given that all other factors have been accounted for). These procedures would seem particularly suited to the study of recognition abilities in infants who are blind <b>or</b> <b>have</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision,</b> but they have not yet been applied in such research. The present investigation involved a pilot assessment of such procedures over two test sessions with two infants with severe low vision...|$|E
