5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness.

Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E

Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.|$|E

5|$|Project Isinglass was {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the vulnerability of existing manned reconnaissance aircraft, such as the Lockheed U-2 and the Lockheed A-12, to Soviet air defenses in the early 1960s, catalysed by the shooting down in May 1960 <b>of</b> <b>Francis</b> Gary Powers. Although there were continuing plans to overfly the Soviet Union with the A-12 – referred to by the CIA as Project Oxcart – these failed to come to pass, and the CIA began plans for an aircraft with superior performance to replace Oxcart.|$|E
5|$|The Veneto–Papal {{alliance}} eventually {{expanded into}} the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about {{the division of}} the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France.

5|$|The {{island was}} rediscovered and named Ducie Island on 16 March 1791 by Captain Edward Edwards, of , {{who had been}} {{despatched}} from Britain in 1790 to arrest the Bounty mutineers.

HMS Pandora turned northwards from Ducie and, because of this change of course, Edwards did not sight the other islands of the group. If HMS Pandora had maintained its course, it would eventually have reached Pitcairn Island and found the Bounty mutineers.|$|E
