40|$|This article {{argues for}} greater clarity in researching {{transnational}} <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management, {{and the need for}} gendered multi-level theory and gendered multi-actor analysis. It examines different understandings and conceptualizations of 'the transnational' in studying transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management, and their implications for understanding and conceptualizing the 'management of cohesion'. In so doing, three conceptual and theoretical questions are considered: what are the major meanings of 'the transnational' in studying transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management? What are the major different disciplinary frameworks in studying transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management? What are the major epistemological debates in studying transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management? Particular emphasis is placed on: the field of studies on transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management; transnational research projects on transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> management; and the lives of transnational researchers. Two ongoing research projects - on gender relations in transnational <b>organizations</b> <b>and</b> managements, and men's changing organizational practices in Europe - are focused on to illustrate these issues. The theme of gender critique is developed throughout...|$|R
