5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which the {{educational}} attainments of a generation are reproduced in Great Britain. We address a very specific question [...] what was the effect, among people born around the middle of the 20 th century, <b>of</b> <b>having</b> acquired <b>a</b> University degree on the probability <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also acquires a degree? We consider the two central processes involved: the effect <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on whether or not <b>a</b> person <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child and, conditional on having at least one child, the effect <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on whether at least one child acquired a degree. We find a strong and persistent negative effect <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on the chances <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child but, among those who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child, the possession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> degree <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large positive effect on the probability of that child also acquiring a degree. These two effects largely cancel out and thus <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very small effect on the chances <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> degree. One major advantage of adopting the prospective approach used here is that it helps to better answer questions concerning the intergenerational effects of changes in education...|$|R

A 50% chance is given to any female who is a carrier to transmit the HPRT1 mutation in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected while daughters who inherit the mutation are carriers. Therefore, with each pregnancy, <b>a</b> carrier female <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 25% chance <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> male that is affected, <b>a</b> 25% chance <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> female that is a carrier, and <b>a</b> 50% chance <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> normal male or female.|$|R

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E

5|$|After {{moving into}} Hollyoaks, Mercedes meets Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) and flirts with him, angering his girlfriend, Sophie Burton (Connie Powney). Mercedes {{develops}} feelings for Russ {{and they have}} sex. They begin a relationship after Sophie dies. Russ is diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection and wrongly accuses Mercedes <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> affair. She is angry with Russ and sleeps with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Mercedes discovers that her mother, Myra (Nicole Barber-Lane), {{is the cause of}} infection and Russ apologieses to Mercedes. Mercedes sleeps with Warren once again and feeling guilty, proposes marriage to Russ. He agrees, revealing that he was also going to propose. On the night before their wedding, Mercedes becomes intoxicated and has sex with Warren for a third time. On the same night, someone attempts to murder Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) and Warren is arrested. Warren tries to prove his innocence as he was with Mercedes, but she denies it. At the wedding, Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) interrupts the proceedings and confronts Mercedes. Mercedes' half-sister, Tina (Leah Hackett), lies and gives her an alibi.

Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis {{at the end of}} one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significance}} of the organization, proposals have occasionally been discussed to relocate its headquarters. Complaints about its current location include diplomats who find it difficult to obtain visas from the United States and local residents complaining of inconveniences whenever the surrounding roads are closed due to visiting dignitaries as well as the high costs to the city. A telephone survey in 2001 found that 67% of respondents favor moving the United Nations headquarters out of the country. Countries critical of the USA, such as Iran and Russia, are especially important in questioning the current location of the United Nations. Arguing that the United States government could manipulate the work of the General Assembly through selective access to politicians from other countries, with the aim <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> advantage over rival countries. Due to accusations of espionage by the United States, the subject of the relocation of the UN headquarters was again discussed, this time for security reasons.|$|E

Even though he withdrew from the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, he regained the world No. 4 ranking, due to Murray's early exit in the second round. He then withdrew from Barcelona and the Rome Masters. On 4 May, del Potro took the option <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> operation to fix the injury. On 19 May, del Potro {{said he would not}} defend his US Open title, but if all went well, he would appear after the event, targeting the Paris Masters as a possible comeback. However, on 22 July, the USTA stated that del Potro was expected to defend his US Open crown. The player himself confirmed that his comeback to the tour would be the Thailand Open and said nothing about the New York event. On 2 August, del Potro returned to the practice courts. A week {{before the start of the}} US Open, after practicing for two weeks, del Potro withdrew from the event, as he felt he was not ready to compete at the highest level.|$|E

5|$|In late December {{and early}} January, student demonstrations in South Vietnam were held against {{neutralism}} and French President Charles de Gaulle, who advocated {{the removal of}} the Americans and negotiations between the two Vietnams. The Council of Notables had accused the provisional government and junta <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> uncertain stance on the issue and went as far as to recommend that South Vietnam suspend diplomatic relations with France. The rumors and crisis heightened when a reputed French agent, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Dinh Lan suddenly returned to Saigon after several years in France. He had served in both the French and Vietnamese National Army and had brought with him several million US dollars worth of South Vietnamese piasters. Lan moved into the home of one of Kim's top aides, fuelling speculation that French agents were being systematically brought into the capital. Such rumors served to spread the belief that a French-sponsored neutralist deal was imminent and gave the conspirators an opportunity to act.|$|E
