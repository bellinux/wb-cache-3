25|$|Gorban–Yablonsky theorem. A {{system of}} {{reactions}} with some irreversible reactions {{is a limit}} of systems with detailed balance when some constants tend to zero if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> (<b>i)</b> the reversible part of this system satisfies the principle of detailed balance and (ii) the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions. Physically, the last condition means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented cyclic pathways.|$|E
25|$|It is {{convenient}} {{when talking about}} a set X of natural numbers to {{view it as a}} sequence x0,x1,x2,... of bits, with x'i= 1 if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>i</b> ∈ X. This viewpoint will make it easier to talk about subalgebras of the power set algebra 2N, which this viewpoint makes the Boolean algebra of all sequences of bits. It also fits well with the columns of a truth table: when a column is read from top to bottom it constitutes a sequence of bits, {{but at the same time}} it can be viewed as the set of those valuations (assignments to variables in the left half of the table) at which the function represented by that column evaluates to 1.|$|E
