5|$|As {{plutonium}} was not available, it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the model which substantiates {{diagnostics}} decision making based on <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC-curves) and predicts optimal values of diagnostic indicators of biomedical information. To assess <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> result prediction <b>the</b> standard criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model were used. Values of these criteria were calculated for the cases when <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> was greater than specificity by several times, when <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> correct diagnoses was maximal, when <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> was equal to its specificity and <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> was several times greater than <b>the</b> specificity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> To assess <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factor characteristics and to compare <b>the</b> prognostic characteristics <b>of</b> models we used mathematical modeling and plotting the ROC-curves. <b>The</b> optimal value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagnostic indicator {{was found to be}} achieved when <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> is equal to its specificity.

Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist was {{in strong}} form ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests,</b> scoring 393 runs at 49.13 in the ODIs in England. The {{highlight}} was the 121 not {{out in the}} final game of the one-day NatWest Series, Gilchrist being awarded the man-of-the-match award. However, he performed poorly in the five Tests, with 204 runs at 25.50. Just as in India in 2001, Australia lost 2–1, and Gilchrist fell four times to man of the series Andrew Flintoff.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{had more}} {{success in the}} tour matches, taking 85 wickets at 18.37 in all {{first-class}} matches. This placed him third in the wicket-taking and fifth in the averages among the Australians. In the first-class matches excluding the Tests, Johnson was the leading wicket-taker. He bowled more overs than anyone but Johnston, allowing Bradman to ease the workload on his pace spearheads Lindwall and Miller, allowing them to conserve energy ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b> Johnson's most successful game with the ball was against Gloucestershire, which yielded match figures of 11/100. Like his bowling, Johnson’s batting was also more successful outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests,</b> scoring 543 runs at 30.16 in 22 innings, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset and an 80 against a MCC team that consisted almost entirely of Test players. Johnson usually batted at No. 7 or No. 8, although he was notably used as a makeshift opener in the Third Test and scored an aggressive 74 at No. 3 in the run-chase against Hampshire.N- Johnson was prominent in the field, taking 23 catches, the most by a non-wicket-keeper on tour. He usually fielded in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, {{and was one}} of {{only four}} players {{remaining}} from before the war. However, he only played in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests</b> due to illness and injury. His early season form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{became a}} regular {{member of the}} Australian Test side in the 1932–33 season and he played in all five Tests against England in the infamous Bodyline series. The Australian {{selectors}} perceived that O'Reilly would be their key bowler, and as he had never played against the English, omitted him from the early tour matches so that the tourists {{would not be able}} to decode his variations. As a result, he missed the Australian XI match against the Englishmen in Melbourne. In two Shield matches ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests,</b> he took 14 wickets, including a total of 9/66 in an innings win over Queensland. Although the national selectors had hidden him from the Englishmen, New South Wales declined to do so, and he played for his state a week ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests.</b> The hosts were bombarded with short-pitched bowling and heavily beaten by an innings; O'Reilly took 4/86 as the visitors amassed 530, dismissing leading English batsman Wally Hammond in the first of many battles between the pair.|$|E
