5|$|Utilitarianism {{is a type}} of consequentialist ethical theory. According to such theories, {{only the}} outcome <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> is morally {{relevant}} (this contrasts with deontology, according to which moral actions flow from duties or motives). Utilitarianism is a combination of consequentialism and the philosophical position hedonism, which states that pleasure, or happiness, is the only good worth pursuing. Therefore, since only the consequences <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> matter, and only happiness matters, only happiness that is the consequence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> is morally relevant. There are similarities with preference utilitarianism, where utility is defined as individual preference rather than pleasure.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrument}}ality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> {{refers to}} whether the instrument of the action was: the body, as in physical actions; one's speech, as in speech acts; or the mind, as in thoughtful deliberation.|$|E
5|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> {{refers to}} the {{temporal}} sequence in which it occurs: the decision to act, plans to facilitate the act, making preparations necessary for the act, and ultimately the carrying through of the act itself.|$|E

The ease <b>of</b> generating <b>an</b> <b>action</b> potential is related both to {{the magnitude of the}} resting potential and to the activation state of membrane sodium channels.|$|R

5|$|Coldhurst, an area along Oldham's {{northern}} boundary with Royton, {{was once}} a chapelry and the site of considerable industry and commerce, including coal mining, cotton spinning and hat manufacture. It {{is said to have}} been the scene <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> in the English Civil War in which the Parliamentarians were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Some LARP rules {{call for}} the use of {{simulated}} weapons such as foam weapons or airsoft guns to determine whether characters succeed in hitting one another in combat situations. In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated weapons is to pause role-play and determine the outcome <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5|$|The {{modality}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> {{refers to}} different modes {{in which one}} can participate in an action, for example: being the one who carries out the act itself; being one who instigates another to perform the act; or being one who gives permission, approval or endorsement of an act.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{listed in the}} Court of Common Pleas as Tichborne v. Lushington, in the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> for the {{ejectment}} of Colonel Lushington, the tenant of Tichborne Park. The real purpose, however, was to establish the Claimant's identity as Sir Roger Tichborne and his rights to the family's estates; failure on his part would expose him as an impostor. In addition to Tichborne Park's , the estates included manors, lands and farms in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over £20,000, equivalent to several millions in 21st-century terms.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action.</b> Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Hercule {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} after attempts to board Mars failed. Both ships were battered and burnt, with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90. Hercule was conveyed to Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810. Both L'Héritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle, which is noted as being a very rare example during this period <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence.|$|E

5|$|Nemesis {{appears on}} the cover of every version of Resident Evil 3, and is {{mentioned}} prominently on flyers for Resident Evil: Survivor 2. Capcom has also released commercial products modeled on the character, such as an adult size Halloween mask, and later a silver ring modeled after Nemesis's head available for purchase through their Japanese online store. Palisades Toys used its likeness to create a posable action figure (packaged with a base and equipable rocket launcher) and a mini bust, which were released alongside several other Resident Evil-based merchandise. Moby Dick released its own line of Resident Evil action figures bundled in pairs of a playable character and enemy. Included in the series were Nemesis's first and second form, with the first form featuring an alternate head and equipable rocket launcher. Each set additionally includes a part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> figure of Nemesis's third form, which measures 24inches (60cm) long when completed.|$|E
5|$|Vijay {{began the}} new {{millennium}} with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamanavale. The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. While Friends was commercially successful, the other two underperformed. His subsequent films that were released for the next year-and-a-half did not do well at the box office. The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003), where he was paired opposite Jyothika, changed his on-screen persona to that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player opposite Trisha in Dharani's Ghilli (2004), which {{went on to become}} the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year. It was also the first Tamil film to earn 500million (Indian rupees). His performance as a caring brother in the masala film Thirupachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007). The latter garnered him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor. Barring Vettaikaaran (2009), all of his subsequent releases from Azhagiya Thamizh Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career, to his 50th film, Sura (2010), were commercial failures.|$|E
