5|$|Boyer and the University Press' {{credibility}} {{was severely}} damaged. In 2000 the University referred all questions to university lawyers who investigated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> about Boyer's work. Later that year the Press removed {{the book from}} their catalog. The book has been discredited as a fraud and a hoax that cannot be relied on.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Seoul {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a book Chung published about the events of 1950, raising awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> inside South Korea. In that same year, the U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service in Korea dismissed one No Gun Ri petition by asserting that any killings took place during combat. The survivors' committee retorted {{that there was no}} battle at No Gun Ri, but U.S. officials refused to reconsider.|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} in Ireland, the Irish Phoenix {{magazine}} alleged {{he was a}} covert CIA agent. Dempsey took a court case against the magazine, which ended in their retraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegation.</b>|$|R
25|$|And <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1903 <b>allegations,</b> 51% were investigated, 36% were locally resolved, 6% were withdrawn, 7% were {{dispensed}} and 0% were discontinued. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 51% <b>allegations</b> investigated 13% were substantiated and 87% were unsubstantiated.|$|R
25|$|Following his actions, Ebbers was {{threatened}} with contempt <b>of</b> Congress charges. <b>The</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> was that Ebbers' statement constituted testimony {{that could not}} be cross-examined. No charge of contempt was ever filed.|$|R
5|$|Kaspersky's prior {{work for}} the Russian {{military}} and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts. According to Kaspersky, allegations of dubious connections with Russian agencies began after {{he got his first}} clients in America. He spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> had not {{previously}} been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear of disbelief and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that the allegations made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E
5|$|On the day Jackson {{began the}} third leg of his tour, news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> broke {{to the public}} and {{received}} worldwide media attention. Jackson ultimately cancelled the remainder of the tour due to health problems arising from the scandal. In January 1994 Jackson reached a financial settlement for $23,000,000 with the Chandlers to resolve the matter and in September a criminal investigation was closed. On November 5, 2009, Chandler committed suicide in his apartment in Jersey City, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Author Simon Winchester {{concluded}} in 2008 that Soviet intelligence was sceptical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegation,</b> but that North Korea leader Kim Il Sung believed it. [...] Winchester said the question [...] "has still not been satisfactorily answered".|$|R

The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies." ...|$|R
50|$|FAIR {{has also}} been criticised for {{supporting}} Ian Paisley's 1999 allegation that Eugene Reavey was involved in <b>the</b> killing <b>of</b> ten Protestant civilians in the Kingsmill massacre on 5 January 1976.

5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there {{said that she}} had looked into some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sarria {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} a legal {{controversy}} over his role on the jury in the 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly picked up in a bar in San Francisco's Castro district. Bolden's attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on the jury that convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden's lover, Pederson and another of the jurors. They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations.</b> Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|Six of the Pendle witches {{came from}} one of two families, each at the time headed by {{a woman in her}} eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her {{daughter}} Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both {{trying to make a living}} from healing, begging, and extortion.|$|E
50|$|Ever since <b>the</b> formal {{founding}} <b>of</b> ISIL {{from its}} Islamist predecessor groups in June 2014, Turkey has faced numerous allegations of collaboration with {{and support for}} ISIL in international media.

5|$|The {{joined forces}} of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to Damietta on 27 October 1169, but the siege was {{unsuccessful}} {{due to the}} failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co-operate fully. According to Byzantine forces, Amalric, not wanting to share the profits of victory, dragged out the operation until the emperor's men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine; Amalric then launched an assault, which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders. On the other hand, William of Tyre remarked that the Greeks were not entirely blameless. Whatever the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> of both sides, when the rains came, both the Latin army and the Byzantine fleet returned home, although half of the Byzantine fleet was lost in a sudden storm.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alvin Kass {{served as}} Rabbi from 1976-2014. Kass {{has also been}} a New York City Police Department {{chaplain}} for over 40 years, and had previously served as a United States Air Force chaplain for two years. At one point during his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli. Kass, who teaches ethics at the Police Academy, was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath. He also convinced the NYPD Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department) to admit David Durk. Durk, along with the more famous Frank Serpico, had been the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> of police corruption that {{led to the formation of}} the Knapp Commission. In 2014, Rabbi Kass retired from the position of Rabbi at East Midwood Jewish Center and currently serves as Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{a case of}} {{copyright}} infringement was filed on the film's producer and director that prompted a court to stall <b>the</b> screening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. <b>The</b> <b>allegation</b> {{pointed out that the}} film was made based on a compilation of short stories that was released in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Carter's 1980 {{campaign}} manager, Timothy Kraft, {{the former}} administration appointments secretary, stepped {{down a few}} weeks before the general election contest against Ronald W.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} <b>the</b> trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allegation</b> <b>of</b> Unconstitutionality number 4277 -DF under <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> Fraser-Honneth debate. We {{intend to}} investigate, according to Fraser-Honneth debate, whether such theoretical frameworks {{are consistent with}} the challenges able to face forms of judicialization expressed in <b>the</b> trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allegation</b> <b>of</b> Unconstitutionality number 4277 -DF by the Brazilian Supreme Court, criticizing speeches implied in votes of Justices, insusceptible to desestabilize the binary sexual identities. Through a monographic method (case study) and using jurisprudential research about <b>the</b> votes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian Supreme Court’s Justices, we conclude that <b>the</b> vote <b>of</b> Justice Carlos Ayres de Brito, despite its progressive content, also establishes a binary structure and certain speeches setting heteronormative standards that impede participatory parity of gay couples. We hold that <b>the</b> ideia <b>of</b> “Fraternal Constitutionalism”, mentioned by the Minister, is linked to affirmative remedies, not transformative. We argue that <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Fraser reveals more theoretical consistency to criticize <b>the</b> argumentative strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Justices, especially given the emphasis on transformative remedies and desconstructive proposal. The research will be developed by the phenomenological hermeneutical method and analytical induction. The research technique will be indirect documentation through bibliographic documentation and documentary research...|$|R
5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on the trainers. Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that he had nothing to do with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E

50|$|A {{claim of}} {{defamation}} is defeated if the defendant proves on <b>the</b> balance <b>of</b> probabilities that <b>the</b> statement was true. If the defence fails, a court may treat any material {{produced by the}} defence to substantiate it, and any ensuing media coverage, as factors aggravating the libel and increasing the damages. A statement quoting another person cannot be justified merely by proving that the other person had also made the statement: <b>the</b> substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> must be proved.|$|R
