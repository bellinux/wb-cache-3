40|$|We {{conducted}} a field experiment on the Internet and investigated the participants' belief updating {{in an individual}} learning environment where they observe a sequence of private signals and in a social learning environment where they observe a sequence of <b>other</b> <b>people's</b> actions.

Furthermore, we confirmed that participant's trust in <b>other</b> <b>people's</b> actions and their conformity to <b>other</b> <b>people's</b> actions are affected by their demographic characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} optimal nonlinear taxation in an OLG {{model with}} two ability-types, where {{people care about}} their own consumption relative to (i) <b>other</b> <b>people’s</b> current consumption, (ii) own past consumption, and (iii) <b>other</b> <b>people’s</b> past consumption. We show that intertemporal consumption comparisons affect the marginal income tax structure in the same qualitative way as comparisons based on <b>other</b> <b>people’s</b> current consumption. Based on available empirical estimates, comparisons with <b>other</b> <b>people’s</b> current and previous consumption tend to substantially increase the optimal marginal labor income tax rates, while they may either increase or decrease the optimal marginal capital income tax rates.
