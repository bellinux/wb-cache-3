5|$|After 1485, the Duchy {{took the}} castle back into direct control, and by 1546 {{it was in}} poor repair. Renovation work was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Elizabeth I, but a report of 1618 {{suggested}} that the castle was unable {{to function as a}} prison because of its poor condition, and fresh repair work was carried out in the 1620s and 1630s under Charles I.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's {{alliance}} with Dušan was paying dividends for the Serbian ruler alone, {{as he had}} free rein to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and Epirus. By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the surrounding region, which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still held <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside Serbian control.|$|E
5|$|Indra Sen (1903–1994) {{was another}} disciple of Sri Aurobindo who, {{although}} little-known in the West, {{was the first}} to articulate integral psychology and integral philosophy, in the 1940s and 1950s.

5|$|Main reforms {{concerning}} the Roman Catholic Church were initiated and carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Maria Theresa, while the reforms under her son concerned their non-Catholic subjects.

5|$|The Hebrides {{were now}} part of the Kingdom of the Isles, whose rulers were {{themselves}} vassals of the Kings of Norway. This situation lasted until the partitioning of the Western Isles in 1156, at which time the Outer Hebrides remained under Norwegian control while the Inner Hebrides broke <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Somerled, the Norse-Gael kinsman of the Manx royal house.|$|E
5|$|The Old White Hart Inn is Grade II listed, and {{described}} as a late 16th-century building. The building was an end entry house but it is unclear when it became an inn.

Moreover, tokens were given <b>out</b> <b>under</b> the Old White Hart's name in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became {{too much for him}} and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship of the state in 1930, with the Commissioners of Works taking control of the property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E

5|$|A {{preliminary}} expedition under Mardonius, in 492BC, {{to secure}} the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia, the latter which had been a Persian vassal {{as early as the}} late 6th century BC. An amphibious task force was then sent <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Datis and Artaphernes in 490BC, using Delos as an intermediate base at, successfully sacking Karystos and Eretria, before moving to attack Athens. However, at the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, resulting in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment {{against the use}} of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> the supervision of the Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried <b>out</b> <b>under</b> Caracalla's orders.|$|E
