5|$|A person under 21 who {{is convicted}} of driving with a BAC level {{of at least}} 0.01%, but less than 0.08% will have their driver's license {{suspended}} for 1 to 3 months, be required to perform 15–30 hours of community service, and take part in an alcohol education program. Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample {{are the same as}} driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a commercial driver's license (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% <b>or</b> <b>greater,</b> drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% <b>or</b> <b>greater,</b> or refuse to submit a breath sample. More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school, or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle. DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered indictable crimes.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density.

5|$|Over {{the past}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been responsible for}} the deaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation. Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts. On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 <b>or</b> <b>greater.</b> However, category 3 <b>or</b> <b>greater</b> hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.|$|E
