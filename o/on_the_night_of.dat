5|$|From late June the 315thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{a series of}} night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced AN/APQ-7 radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube Oil Refinery at Yokkaichi <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> 26June. The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck the refinery destroyed or damaged 30percent of the facility. The unit's next attack was against a refinery at Kudamatsu three nights later, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> 2July it struck another refinery at Minoshima. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> 6/7July the 315thBombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil refinery near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery. The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities {{by the end of the}} war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan had almost no crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.|$|E
