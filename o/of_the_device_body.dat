40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} steerable, electrostatic, untethered, MEMS micro-robot, with {{dimensions}} of 60 µm by 250 µm by 10 µm. This micro-robot is 1 to 2 {{orders of magnitude}} smaller in size than previous micro-robotic systems. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator. These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate and without constraining rails or tethers. Control and power delivery waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>body.</b> Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace (the robot is globally controllable). These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3. 7 ◦ /mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 µm, and achieve speeds of over 200 µm/sec, with an average step size of 12 nm.

50|$|The Falcon {{in essence}} is a {{consumer}} robot. It consists of its grip connected via three arms to a roughly conical body, which {{sits on a}} U-shaped base. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three arms moves in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Falcon's body. The default grip is a small spherical grip with 4 buttons on the top. The buttons are the Novint Logo for the primary button (which is similar to an 'N'), an upside down triangle (similar to a 'V'), a lightning bolt (similar to an 'N'), and a plus (similar to a 'T'), which collectively make the letters 'NVNT', the consonants in Novint's name and its ticker symbol as a public company. At the front flattened point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Falcon's conical housing is a Novint Falcon logo that lights up in different colors to indicate <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> <b>body</b> contains 3 motors, each attached to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Falcon's arms by a cable that is wrapped around a capstan on the motor. As each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 arms moves, an optical sensor attached to each motor keeps track <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arm.

40|$|International {{audience}} Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) is {{a technology}} of growing importance in present and upcoming wireless network standards (WIFI, 4 G, 5 G), {{as it is}} anticipated to provide large performance gains, mainly in terms of link/network capacity and link robustness (through diversity). However there is no free lunch and implementing MIMO is neither simple nor always beneficial. Among the several problems encountered {{is the fact that}} <b>the</b> operating conditions <b>of</b> MIMO terminals are, often, far from ideal and subject to a set of impairments. In particular, the antenna signals are not uncorrelated and not identically distributed, as often considered in historical and simplistic MIMO system models. What's worse is that these impairments are not uniquely defined for a given terminal but they critically depend on the electromagnetic environmental conditions, both regarding <b>the</b> immediate vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> (user <b>body,</b> supporting hardware [...] .) and the farther distant local propagation context (indoor, outdoor [...] . environment). In other words, many sources of joint antenna-channel impairments do affect the MIMO terminal performance, which should be identified and modeled for an educated understanding and an accurate performance evaluation and optimization of wireless networks. Among the classical (non physical) channel models used to evaluate MIMO system performance, the Kronecker approximation is both very simple to use and reasonably accurate, as long as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> antennas is small. It is based on a separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correlation between <b>the</b> entries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel matrix, into transmit and receive side correlations, which allows characterizing the terminal independently from the base station/access point. In a Rayleigh channel, modeling the MIMO system is then extremely easy. Unfortunately, we have shown in a previous work (A. Sibille and A. J. Braga, IEEE APS URSI, Toronto, 2010), that this does not apply to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> terminals subject to varying environmental conditions, due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> Gaussianity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel coefficients. In the present work we investigate the various factors impacting MIMO performance, in relation to environmental variability. We particularly involve non identical antenna behavior (power gain, radiation patterns) and the correlation between antenna signals resulting from a moderate multipath angular spread. According to <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> these impairments and their degree of variability, common performance criteria such as ergodic capacity and diversity gain are evaluated and compared to simplified models. Some consequences are discussed, in relation to relevant use cases for 4 G and 5 G and in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> MIMO terminals performance evaluation and MIMO terminals model standardization. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{integration}} <b>of</b> robotic {{technologies in}} surgical instrumentation {{has contributed to}} <b>the</b> further development <b>of</b> Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) aimed at reducing the patient trauma and hospitalisation costs. Recent advances in imaging and mechatronics promise to enable <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> more complex interventions through a single incision or natural orifice access. The main requirement for such procedures {{is the ability to}} reach the operative target through complex routes and curved anatomical pathways whilst maintaining adequate stability for tissue manipulation. A mechatronically controlled device {{with a high degree of}} articulation can potentially fulfil these requirements. However, <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> a high number of Degrees-of-Freedom (DoFs) increases <b>the</b> control complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to investigate different methods for reducing <b>the</b> control dimensionality <b>of</b> a hyper-redundant snake-like articulated robot for MIS. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot is based on a modular, flexible access platform featuring serially connected rigid links and a hybrid micromotor-tendon actuation strategy to construct independently addressable universal joints. A path length compensation scheme for reducing the backlash at the joint is presented, together with experimental evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint positioning accuracy when using our proposed kinematic control. <b>The</b> integration <b>of</b> an extra translational DoF along the joint axis allows <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a hybrid 'inchworm-snake' locomotive scheme for self-propulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> This 'front-drive back-following' approach is implemented by actuating only one module at a time in a serial fashion. Therefore, the operator only needs to steer <b>the</b> distal tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> while <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot follows the desired trajectory autonomously. Once <b>the</b> distal tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hyper-redundant <b>device</b> has reached <b>the</b> target operative site, <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot has to adapt its shape to the surrounding moving organs while keeping the end-effector stable.

40|$|Hot-electron {{stressing}} on GaN-based {{light emitting}} diodes (LEDs) has been performed using a do stressing current. Detailed characterizations on the degradations in the optoelectronic and low-frequency noise properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> have been conducted. Experimental results on I-V, electroluminescence (EL) and the integrated light output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> exhibit significant degradations with the stress time. Investigations on the low-frequency excess noise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> show that <b>the</b> degradations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> properties arise from <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> interface states at the In-GaN/GaN heterointerface due to hot-electron stressing. Over two orders of magnitude increase in the current noise power spectral density, SI(f), is typically observed prior to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices.</b> Furthermore, it is shown that <b>the</b> initial rate <b>of</b> increase in SI(f) resulting from a dc current stress time of 48 hours is strongly correlated to <b>the</b> lifetimes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> demonstrating that flicker noise measurement {{can be used as}} a diagnostic tool for hot-electron hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> Department <b>of</b> Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> vacuum sealing <b>the</b> backside cavity <b>of</b> a Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT). The {{presence or absence}} <b>of</b> air inside <b>the</b> cavity has a marked effect upon the system parameters, such as the natural frequency, damping, and the pull-in voltage. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> vacuum inside <b>the</b> cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> causes {{a reduction in the}} effective gap height which leads to a reduction in the pull-in voltage. We carry out ANSYS simulations to quantify this reduction. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> vacuum inside <b>the</b> cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> causes stress stiffening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane, which changes <b>the</b> natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> A prestressed modal analysis is carried out to determine the change in natural frequency due to stress stiffening.
