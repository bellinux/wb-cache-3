40|$|Currently, lack of {{preventive}} measure {{is the problem}} that implicates poor maintenance outcome. Scheduled maintenance is claimed as a maintenance strategy to tackle the problem. However, the effectiveness <b>of</b> scheduled <b>maintenance</b> can be greatly influenced by the length <b>of</b> predetermined <b>maintenance</b> interval. Thus, this paper aims to study the relationship between length <b>of</b> predetermined <b>maintenance</b> interval and maintenance performance. The literature review identifies the length <b>of</b> predetermined <b>maintenance</b> interval as an importance characteristic <b>of</b> scheduled <b>maintenance</b> strategy. A quantitative approach is adopted and carried out through questionnaire survey. Subsequently, descriptive analysis and correlation analysis are used to analyse the collected data. Then, research result demonstrates that the length <b>of</b> predetermined <b>maintenance</b> interval is significantly correlated to the maintenance performance. The length <b>of</b> predetermined <b>maintenance</b> interval {{must be considered in}} maintenance planning and execution. The research recommends continuous monitoring or regular inspection of building systems and components to identify their condition and update the length <b>of</b> predetermined <b>maintenance</b> interval regularly. Consequently, the effective maintenance execution helps to avoid systems failure occurs and optimises maintenance performance...|$|R

In this case, the application use AHP and TOPSIS as method of decision support system. In application, user will be asked to decide criteria and its weight, then user will compare all alternative in each criteria. After that, application will produce an order of alternative.
