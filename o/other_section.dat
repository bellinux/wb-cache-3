The petitioner's advocate H S Jain {{said that even}} though Rambhadracharya and other leaders were arrested under the section 151 of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, which permits an arrest to prevent commission of cognisable offences, the custody period cannot exceed 24 hours unless any <b>other</b> <b>section</b> of the code or any other law is applicable.

5|$|Profitability was maintained, {{with the}} result then {{when most of the}} Shropshire Union network of canals were {{abandoned}} in 1944, the sections which had originally been the Chester Canal, the Ellesmere Canal, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Middlewich Branch were all retained. The only <b>other</b> <b>section</b> which was not abandoned was the Llangollen branch; this was kept because of its function as a water supply channel, rather than for navigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{second section}} of Route 7, {{designated}} a northsouth road, heads north on Washington Avenue from the Second River crossing on the Newark/Belleville border, {{passing through a}} business district. The route intersects County Route 506 (Belleville Avenue), and that county route then forms a concurrency with Route 7 along the next block of Washington Avenue, to the intersection with Rutgers Street. At that point, County Route 506 heads to the east, ending {{at the intersection of}} Main Street, Rutgers Street, and bridge to Belleville (which is also the <b>other</b> <b>section</b> of Route 7).|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske Ceste. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through an analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Jankomir - Zaprešić, {{is not included in}} this report, as it is not tolled. However, since the section is a part of Zagreb bypass, it is considered to carry heavier traffic than any <b>other</b> <b>section</b> of the A2 motorway. In 2006, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, and its traffic volume grew considerably since the completion of the motorway in 2007.|$|E
5|$|With the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the south-southwest, and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes.

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every <b>other</b> <b>section.</b> Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, MD32 was {{extended}} east on Guilford Road from US1 to the Howard Anne Arundel county line at Annapolis Junction. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road. MD32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973. MD32 {{was extended}} east into Anne Arundel County in 1969 when the designation {{was extended to}} {{just east of the}} BaltimoreWashington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade. The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west of Oakland Mills Road in Guilford to a turnaround just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD32's modern interchange with I-95. The <b>other</b> <b>section</b> was a two-lane road from MD175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD32 and I-97 to MD178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD3 in Millersville. As of 1978, MD32's interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps {{on the north side of}} MD32due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military baseand a fifth ramp from the northbound Parkway to eastbound MD32. The MD3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD32 to northbound MD3. All other movements were made via MD178 or Millersville Road.|$|E

25|$|During the {{war there}} was a split in the movement. N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena opposed a merger into the BLPI and formed the 'Workers' Opposition'.

Members of the <b>other</b> <b>section,</b> formed out of the exiled BLPI nucleus, effectively maintained a separate party, the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party.

On 28 July, Salvatore Breglia settled into the post, and served through war's end. A Hanriot HD.1 section detached from 75a Squadriglia joined the 71a Squadriglia on 28 August 1918. On 20 October 1918, 71a Squadriglia was bisected, with one of its sections staying put while the six Spad VIIs of the <b>other</b> <b>section</b> moved to Quinto di Treviso to join a section from 75a Squadriglia in an ad hoc squadron. On 23 October, 71a Squadriglia became part of 17o Gruppo. On 31 October 1918, Capitano Breglia was wounded, but remained in command.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1664, the Duke of York {{gave the}} part of his new {{possessions}} between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret in exchange for settlement of a debt. The territory was named after the Island of Jersey, Carteret's ancestral home. The <b>other</b> <b>section</b> of New Jersey was sold to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who was a close friend of the Duke. As a result, Carteret and Berkeley became the two English Lords Proprietors of New Jersey. The Province of New Jersey was created, but the border was not finalized until 1765 (see New York-New Jersey Line War). In 1667, territories between the Byram River and Connecticut River were split off to become the western half of Connecticut.|$|E
