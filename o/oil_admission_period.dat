In terms of queueing theory {{this means that}} a group of requests from users can be processed simultaneously in parallel and processing of the whole group is considered finished if processing of all individual requests belonging to this group is over. In this paper we consider a novel retrial queueing model where the requests (customers) are served in groups of finite size which are formed during a period of random length that is called <b>admission</b> <b>period.</b> The problem of choosing the optimal length of <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> and optimal size of the groups is faced here under assumptions that the input flow of customers is described by a MAP (Markovian Arrival Process), length of <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> and individual service time have phase type distribution.

40|$|A novel {{customer}} service discipline for a single-server retrial queue is proposed and anal- ysed. Arriving customers are accumulated {{in a pool}} of finite capacity. Customers arriving when the pool is full go into orbit and attempt to access the service later. It is assumed that customers access the service as a group. The size of the group is defined by the num- ber of customers in the pool at the instant the service commences. All customers within a group finish receiving the service simultaneously. If the pool is full at the point the ser- vice finishes, a new service begins immediately and all customers from the pool begin to be served. Otherwise, the customer <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> starts. The duration of this period is random and depends on the number of customers in the pool when the <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> begins. However, if the pool becomes full before the <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> expires, this period is terminated and a new service begins. The system behaviour is described by a multi- dimensional Markov chain. The generator and the condition of ergodicity of this Markov chain are derived, and an algorithm for computing the stationary probability distribution of the states of the Markov chain is given. Formulas for computing various performance measures of the system are presented, and the results of numerical experiments show that these measures essentially depend on the capacity of the pool and the distribution of the duration of the <b>admission</b> <b>period.</b> The advantages of the proposed {{customer service}} discipline over the classical discipline and the discipline in which customers cannot enter the pool during the service period are illustrated numerically...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery {{ligation}} and recto-anal repair (DG-HAL & RAR) {{is known}} for low recurrence, high patient satisfaction, and less postoperative pain. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the 1 -year follow-up results in patients who underwent a DG-HAL & RAR and to establish the benefits of the procedure. Methods: Among the hemorrhoid patients who were admitted to our hospital from March 2008 to May 2010 and who underwent a DG-HAL & RAR, 97 patients who were followed up for a year were investigated. Recurrence, complications, <b>admission</b> <b>period,</b> difference in preoperative and postoperative pain, operation time, and time to return to daily activities were investigated. Results: The average <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> was 1. 6 ± 1. 1 days. Pain at postoperative day 7 showed no significant difference from preoperative pain (P> 0. 05). The operation time was 34. 0 ± 7. 3 minutes on average, and return to daily activities was timed at 2. 3 ± 2. 0 days postoperatively. At the one year follow-up, no serious complications were noted, and preoperative symptoms recurred only in 14 patients (14. 4 %).

The inspector sent the old I-94 and the corrected I-94 to the contractor which data enters I-94s for the INS. The May 2, 2001, transaction with Atta was data entered and then uploaded to NIIS {{as if it were a}} new entry by Atta. This happened because the inspector issued a new I-94 with a new admission number on it.

40|$|Do {{in vitro}} {{fertilization}} (IVF) multiples generate higher hospital costs than IVF singletons, from birth up to age 5 ? Hospital costs from birth up to age 5 were significantly higher among IVF/ICSI multiple children compared with IVF/ICSI singletons; however, when excluding the costs incurred during the birth <b>admission</b> <b>period,</b> hospital costs of multiples and singletons were comparable. Concern has risen over the long-term outcome of children born after IVF. The increased incidence of multiple births in IVF {{as a result of}} double-embryo transfer predisposes children to a poorer neonatal outcome such as preterm birth and low birthweight. As a consequence, IVF multiples require more medical care. Costs and consequences of poorer neonatal outcomes in multiples may also exist later in life. All 5497 children born from IVF in 2003 - 2005, whose parents received IVF or ICSI treatment in one of five participating Dutch IVF centers, served as a basis for a retrospective cohort study. Based on gestational age, birthweight, Apgar and congenital malformation, children were assigned to one of three risk strata (low-, moderate- or high-risk). To enhance the efficiency of the data collection, 816 multiples and 584 singletons were selected for 5 -year follow-up based on stratified (risk) sampling. Parental informed consent was received of 322 multiples and 293 singletons. Individual-level hospital resource use data (hospitalization, outpatient visits and medical procedures) were retrieved from hospital information systems and patient charts for 302 multiples and 278 singletons. The risk of hospitalization (OR 4. 9, 95 % CI 3. 3 - 7. 0), outpatient visits (OR 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 3. 6) and medical procedures (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 2) was higher for multiples compared with singletons. The average hospital costs amounted to € 10 018 and € 2093 during the birth <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> (P < 0. 001), € 1131 and € 696 after the birth <b>admission</b> <b>period</b> to the first birthday (not significant (n. s.)) and € 1084 and € 938 from the second to the fifth life year (n. s.) for multiples and singletons, respectively. Hospital costs from birth up to age 5 were 3. 3 -fold higher for multiples compared with singletons (P < 0. 001). Among multiples and singletons, respectively, 90. 8 and 76. 2 % of the total hospital costs were caused by hospital admission days and 8. 9 and 25. 2 % of the total hospital costs during the first 5 years of life occurred after the first year of life.

This study confirms the increased use of healthcare resources by IVF/ICSI multiples compared with IVF/ICSI singletons.

SUMMARY ANSWER Hospital costs from birth up to age 5 were significantly higher among IVF/ICSI multiple children compared with IVF/ICSI singletons; however, when excluding the costs incurred during the birth <b>admission</b> <b>period,</b> hospital costs of multiples and singletons were comparable. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Concern has risen over the long-term outcome of children born after IVF. The increased incidence of multiple births in IVF {{as a result of}} double-embryo transfer predisposes children to a poorer neonatal outcome such as preterm birth and low birthweight. As a consequence, IVF multiples require more medical care. Costs and consequences of poorer neonatal outcomes in multiples may also exist later in life. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION All 5497 children born from IVF in 2003 - 2005, whose parents received IVF or ICSI treatment in one of five participating Dutch IVF centers, served as a basis for a retrospective cohort study.

Individual-level hospital resource use data (hospitalization, outpatient visits and medical procedures) were retrieved from hospital information systems and patient charts for 302 multiples and 278 singletons. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The risk of hospitalization (OR 4. 9, 95 % CI 3. 3 - 7. 0), outpatient visits (OR 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 3. 6) and medical procedures (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 2) was higher for multiples compared with singletons.
