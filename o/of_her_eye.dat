The painstakingly elaborated plasticity of the lips, the lusciousness of their form and their slightly open position, gives her an exceptionally feminine physiognomy. A single small {{yellow and red}} pebble in her the pupil <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> creates a genuinely rare look on the woman's figure.|$|E
25|$|Springer (born late 1999 {{or early}} 2000), officially named A73, is a wild orca (also known as killer whale) from the Northern Resident {{community}} of orcas which every summer frequent {{the waters off}} {{the northern part of}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC). In 2002, Springer, then a calf, was discovered alone and emaciated some 250 miles from her family's (called a pod), territory. Experts identified Springer by her vocal calls that are specific to her pod and by examining photographs <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> patch. They were also able determine where Springer's pod was currently located.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig out of the corner <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E

500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear coming out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> She didn’t want to do it, {{but she had no}} choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|The Who's That Girl World Tour was musically and {{technically}} {{superior to}} Madonna's Virgin Tour, because she incorporated multimedia components {{to make the}} show more compelling. As the tour was confirmed, Madonna and her team started planning for it. Madonna wanted a show which consisted of theatrics, drama, dance and choreography in [...] "full-force". Her publicist Liz Rosenberg commented, [...] "She wants a visual impact that would knock people out. She was very determined about this. And she's the type that makes decisions quickly; If something doesn't work, she starts over. You'll see a different look this year, but it's still Madonna, still bigger than life." [...] In order to engage herself completely and handle the grueling dance routines, she started attending aerobics classes at Hollywood health centre The Sports Connection. By the time the tour drew nearer, she hired a personal trainer, and her daily routine involved jogging, weight-lifting, dancing, gymnastics, trampoline, swimming and cycling. She started eating vegetarian food with plenty of protein and carbohydrate and avoided the sun. British funk band Level 42 was the supporting act of the tour. Madonna's image {{was that of a}} blond girl with soft curls, making a striking contrast with the firm, almost hard lines <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> make-up and lipstick; the idea of her friend actress Debi Mazar.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circle}} of her {{literary}} friends, Lokhvitskaya was surrounded by 'aura of adoration'; {{it seemed as if}} every man, according to a biographer, [...] "was a little in love with her." [...] Among them was Bunin. In a by and large grim gallery of his literary portraits (most of them crude caricatures), Lokhvitskaya was the only person whom he remembered fondly. [...] "Everything in her was charming: the sound of her voice, the liveliness of her speech, the glitter <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> her wonderful facetiousness. The colour of her face was exceptionally beautiful: opaque and smooth, like that of a ripe Crimean apple," [...] Bunin wrote in his memoirs.|$|E

John Hale explained how this supposedly worked: [...] "the Witch by the cast <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> sends forth a Malefick Venome into the Bewitched to cast him into a fit, and therefore the touch of the hand doth by sympathy cause that venome to return into the Body of the Witch again".|$|E

She has sociopathic tendencies, smiling and acting cheerful even when revealing to Ryuko that she killed her father and stole half of his Rending Scissors, at the cost <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> She later reveals that she is part Life Fiber, with superhuman abilities such as tearing apart Life Fibers in Goku Uniforms and kamuis, manipulating people's minds with Mental Stitching, healing from severe cuts to her body, cloning herself, and changing her appearance. The only time in the series where she loses her cool is when Ryuko severs her arms at the Life Fiber level. She helps create Ragyo's kamui Shinra-Kotetsu and sacrifices herself at Ragyo's request to help the latter attain her ultimate power.|$|E
2500|$|After a few lean years, Tanaka made a come-back {{effort with}} the third entry in the Angel Guts series, the {{critical}} and box-office success, Angel Guts: Nami (1980). Jasper Sharp writes that, {{from the point of}} character, plotting and construction, Tanaka's film is the most satisfying entry in the series, based on an adult manga by Takashi Ishii. He notes, however, that Tanaka's visuals are over-active make the film a difficult one for most viewers. Tanaka recalled, [...] "I was determined to make a film which was much more impressive than the comic. One image of a film has to be much more impressive than one frame of the comic. That's what film is all about. For the scene in which we see Nami's eye in close-up on the screen, I shot about 3,000 feet of film just to show the details <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and [...] movement, including the pulsing of a blood vessel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking out of the corner <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, {{in the general direction of}} her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through the corner <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E
