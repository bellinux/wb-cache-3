5|$|The {{archaeologist}} Leslie Grinsell {{reported that}} in the mid-1970s, he learned of a folk tale that the stones had once been children who were turned to stones as punishment for playing Five-Stones <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday.</b> This folk motif of humans turned to stone for revelling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> had been attached {{to a range of}} prehistoric monuments across south-western Britain by the early eighteenth century, although it had been first recorded in Cornwall in 1602. It is likely connected to Sabbatarianism, and may have been spread by Protestant preachers.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin became Bishop of Worcester on 10 August 1180. While at Worcester, he {{impressed}} King Henry II by {{intervening in}} a secular case {{to prevent a}} hanging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday.</b> Although the medieval writer Walter Map said that Baldwin was determined to continue writing even after his election to the bishopric, none of Baldwin's writings can be dated to his time as bishop except for one sermon.|$|E

5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E
5|$|From 1959 through 1967 (with the {{exception}} of 1963), the show was regularly pre-empted by CBS's annual two-hour fall telecast of The Wizard of Oz, which was always shown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> from 6:00 to 8:00 P.M. E.S.T. Because the 1939 film always drew such a huge TV audience, CBS's Nielsen ratings in the 7:00 P.M. time slot remained high.|$|E

In 1982, both were repainted in MMTB chocolate and cream {{for use in the}} film Squizzy Taylor.|$|R

During the 1990s, the following albums were Christmas number ones.|$|E

5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} Giffnock was furthered in 1905 {{by the arrival}} of the first Glasgow Corporation Tramways tram in the town. The {{addition}} of this tram link and the nearby Whitecraigs railway station helped the popularity of Giffnock as a weekend destination and lead to the opening of Rouken Glen park in 1906 by Archibald Corbett (later Lord Rowallan), the M.P. for Tradeston. The Giffnock tramline was one of Glasgow Corporation Tramways's most profitable routes; up to 15,000 travelled to Giffnock <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> to visit Rouken Glen.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{remained a}} strong influence though, and when new breweries were set up, the outcry led to the Welsh Sunday Closing Act in 1881, an act that forced the closure of public houses in Wales <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday.</b> Wales' passion for beer remained; the Wrexham Lager Beer Company opened in 1881, as the first lager producer in Britain. The Felinfoel Brewery {{made a deal with}} the local tin works and became the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{along with}} Arsenal, {{were the first}} club to play with shirt numbers, on 25 August 1928 in their match against Swansea Town. They were the first English side to travel by {{aeroplane}} to a domestic away match, when they visited Newcastle United on 19 April 1957, and the first First Division side to play a match <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday,</b> when they faced Stoke City on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a Premier League match against Southampton.|$|E

When director Milan Luthria became ill with a virus, shooting was postponed for three days. To make up the lost time Luthria persuaded Kumar to work on two consecutive Sundays, {{the first time he had}} worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> since Priyadarshan's 2006 Bhagam Bhag. The remainder {{of the film}} was shot on location in Khala, on the Sassoon Docks and at Mukesh Mills in Mumbai. The shoot was wrapped up by January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to ever have been sworn into a second term. Because January 20 fell <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday,</b> a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer, Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|The Games {{took place}} on the Thursday and Friday of the week of Whitsun, {{normally}} between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century Puritans disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> or a church holiday such as Whitsun. By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday.</b> Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main {{business}} of the council was the debate {{on a number of}} canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted with amusement, as the council members felt that all clergy should already know that marriage was forbidden to them.|$|E
5|$|When Queen Beatrix succeeded {{her mother}} Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen {{decided to keep}} the holiday on 30 April {{as a tribute to}} her mother. (If 30 April fell <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sunday,</b> Koninginnedag was {{observed}} the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.) The reason was practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for Koninginnedag celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in.|$|E
