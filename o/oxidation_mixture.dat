40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{electrochemical}} oxidation mechanisms of three typical fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs), and investigated residual antibacterial activity and toxicity changes after oxidation processes. Electrochemistry coupled to mass spectrometry (EC-MS) {{was used to}} study the oxidation processes of ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NOR) and ofloxacin (OFL). Eight oxidation products for each parent compound were identified and their chemical structures were elucidated. The transformation trend of each product, with the continuous increase of voltage from 0 to 3000 mV, was recorded by online EC-MS. The oxidation pathways were proposed based on the structural information and transformation trends of oxidation products. We found the oxidation mechanisms of FQs consisted of the hydroxylation and cleavage of piperazinyl ring via reactions with hydroxyl radicals, while the fluoroquinolone core remained intact. The antibacterial activity of the parent compounds and their <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixtures</b> was estimated using zone inhibition tests for gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium. It {{was found that the}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixtures</b> of CIP and NOR retained the antibacterial properties with lower activity compared to their parent compounds, while the antibacterial activity of OFL was almost eliminated after oxidation. Furthermore, the toxicity of the three FQs and their <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixtures</b> were evaluated using algal growth inhibition test (Desmodesmus subspicatus). The median effective concentration (EC 50) values for the algal inhibition tests were calculated for the end point of growth rate. The toxicity of CIP and NOR to green algae after electrochemical oxidation, remained unchanged, while that of OFL significantly increased.

Although the non-oxidized R-(+) -limonene itself is not allergenic, it easily forms allergenic products due to autoxidation during handling and storage. 2273 patients at 4 dermatological clinics in Europe were patch tested between 1997 and 1999 in 2 steps. First, the <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixture</b> of R-(+) -limonene and 1 selected allergen fraction of the mixture, the limonene hydroperoxides, were tested in 2 different vehicles in consecutive patients. A diverging frequency of positive patch test reactions was observed in the 4 clinics. 3. 8 % of the consecutive patients tested reacted to oxidized R-(+) -limonene in 2 clinics, 6. 5 % in the 3 rd, whereas 0. 3 % in the 4 th clinic. In 2 of the centres, different but significant concomitant positive response rates to other allergens were observed; e. g. to fragrance materials and to colophonium. However, in the total test population, 57 % of the limonene-allergic subjects did not react to any of the fragrance allergy markers used in the standard series. In the 2 nd step, patients showing positive reactions were retested, also including additional separate allergens of the limonene <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixture</b> (carvone and limonene oxide). 60 % of the limonene-allergic patients showed positive results at retesting. The limonene hydroperoxide fraction was proved to be the most important allergen of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixture,</b> showing positive reactions in around 60 % of the limonene-allergic patients at both test sessions. Testing limonene oxide and carvone separately resulted in very few positive reactions. 3 % oxidized R-(+) -limonene in non-stabilized petrolatum is most suitable when using only 1 test preparation for diagnosis of contact allergy to oxidized limonene.

Controlled oxidation of the chromatophores with Ir(IV) or with Zn(II) and ferricyanide preferentially destroys the more strongly absorbing pigment (abs. max. 880 mu) but brings about only a slight decrease in {{the magnitude of the}} photoinduced absorption changes at 810 and 792 mu.

This pigment is formed irreversibly and is therefore different from the material formed by photooxidation of chromatophores. Its visible spectrum and the spectrum of the material formed from it by acidification suggest that it is a chlorophyll-like substance, possibly derived from bacteriochlorophyll by (two-electron) oxidation of one of the dihydropyrrole rings to a pyrrole ring.

Both oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool {{have recently been}} patch tested in an international setting, showing contact allergy in 5. 2 % and 6. 9 % of dermatitis patients, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To investigate concomitant reactions between oxidized R-limonene and oxidized linalool in consecutive dermatitis patients. METHODS: Oxidized R-limonene 3. 0 % (containing limonene hydroperoxides 0. 33 %) and oxidized linalool 6 % (linalool hydroperoxides 1 %) in petrolatum were tested in 2900 consecutive dermatitis patients in Australia, Denmark, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 281 patients reacted to either oxidized R-limonene or oxidized linalool. Of these, 25 % had concomitant reactions to both compounds, whereas 29 % reacted only to oxidized R-limonene and 46 % only to oxidized linalool. Of the 152 patients reacting to oxidized R-limonene, 46 % reacted to oxidized linalool, whereas 35 % of the 200 patients reacting to oxidized linalool also reacted to oxidized R-limonene. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the patients (75 %) reacted to {{only one of the}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixtures,</b> thus supporting the specificity of the reactions. The concomitant reactions to the two fragrance allergens suggest multiple sensitizations, which most likely reflect the exposure to the different fragrance materials in various types of consumer products.

The direct extraction made the extractive step easy and gave reproducible data. 5 -Iodovanillin was selected as a new internal standard. The reason for this selection was that 5 -iodovanillin {{did not exist in}} the nitrobenzene oxidation products from any plant species and had an aldehyde group whose peak did not overlap with the other aldehyde peaks on an 1 H-NMR spectrum. Thus, the use of 5 -iodovanillin enabled us to quantifyp-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde in oxidation products on the basis of 1 H-NMR analysis as well as GC. Furthermore, more information about the condensed structure of lignin was derived by comparing the 1 H-NMR and GC analyses.|$|E

Periodical HPLC analysis of the <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixture</b> showed that, in the presence of DHI, the rate of substrate consumption is markedly reduced. The inhibitory potency was significantly increased either by preincubation of DHI with the enzyme or by increasing the time of residence of the indole in aerated buffer solutions prior to contact with the enzyme. Addition of catalase to the incubation mixture resulted in a partial removal of DHI inhibition. From these and other experiments, an inhibition mechanism is proposed which involves inactivation of the enzyme by reactive species, expecially hydrogen peroxide, arising from DHI autoxidation...|$|E

The objective {{of the study was to}} develop a dry method that would be easy to apply and allow the complete conversion of organic S to sulfate in soil samples and later detection by turbidimetry. The effectiveness of organic S oxidation to sulfate was evaluated by means of three alkaline oxidation mixtures: NaHCO 3 + Ag 2 O, Eschka mixture (17 % Na 2 CO 3, 66 % MgO, and 17 % K 2 CO 3), and NaHCO 3 + CuO. The procedure to quantify the sulfate concentration was based on the reaction with barium chloride and turbidimetric detection. Sulfur quantification in the standard sample by the wet method proved adequate, precise and accurate. It should also be pointed out that no significant differences were found (95 % reliability) between the wet and dry processes (NaHCO 3 and Ag 2 O <b>oxidation</b> <b>mixture)</b> in six different Brazilian soils. The proposed dry method can therefore be used in the preparation of soil samples for total S determination...|$|E
40|$|Total <b>oxidation</b> of <b>mixture</b> of dilute {{volatile}} organic compounds {{was carried out in}} a dielectric barrier discharge reactor with various transition metal oxide catalysts integrated in-plasma. The experimental results indicated the best removal efficiencies in the presence of metal oxide catalysts, especially MnOx, whose activity was further improved with AgOx deposition. It was confirmed water vapor improves the efficiency of the plasma reactor, probably due to the formation of hydroxyl species, whereas, in situ decomposition of ozone on the catalyst surface may lead to nascent oxygen. It may be concluded that non-thermal plasma approach is beneficial for the removal of mixture of {{volatile organic}} compounds than individual VOCs, probably due to the formation of reactive intermediates like aldehydes, peroxides, etc...|$|R
40|$|The method {{described}} here {{is based on}} a brief report by Harley-Mason and Archer. It involves the use of p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA), a vinylogue of Ehrlich's reagent, as a color reagent for indoles. Colorimetric analyses of indoleacetic acid (IAA) <b>oxidation</b> reaction <b>mixtures</b> were made with the DMACA reagent as a solution rather than a spray. DMACA reagent will yield a wine-red color with IAA oxidation products in solution. Under similar conditions DMACA reacts with authentic IAA to yield only slight coloration at best. In comparison with other indoles, DMACA is more relative with IAA oxidation reaction products than either Salkowski or Ehrlich's reagents. Data discussed support a concept that the color produced with DMACA is due to the presence of tautomeric oxidation product(s) of IAA...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple oxidation experiment that presents the student with a puzzle and is a good exercise in 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The experiment, which illustrates the important concept of selectivity in organic synthesis, involves selective <b>oxidation</b> of a <b>mixture</b> of 1 -heptanol and 2 -heptanol using commercial swimming pool chlorine. 1 H NMR analysis of the product mixture allows the student to determine the selectivity exhibited by the reagent...|$|R
