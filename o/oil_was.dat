5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. <b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> used throughout {{the country as a}} light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard <b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|Grapefruit seed oil, {{extracted}} from the seeds of grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi). Grapefruit seed <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> extracted experimentally in 1930 and was shown to be suitable for making soap.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) {{was formed}} as a joint venture by British Petroleum and Gulf. Both British Petroleum and Gulf held equal shares in the venture. KOC pioneered the {{exploration}} for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. <b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> discovered at Burgan in 1938 {{but it was not}} until 1946 that the first crude <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and gas being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1.|$|E
50|$|Engine <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{filtered}} {{to remove}} impurities. Filtration of <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> normally done with volume filtration. Filter papers for lubrication <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> impregnated to resist high temperatures.|$|R
25|$|One {{limiting}} factor in industrial uses of vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>is</b> that all such <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to becoming rancid. <b>Oils</b> that <b>are</b> more stable, such as ben oil or mineral <b>oil,</b> <b>are</b> thus preferred for industrial uses. Castor oil has numerous industrial uses, {{owing to the}} presence of hydroxyl group on the fatty acid. Castor <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> a precursor to Nylon 11.|$|R
50|$|Perilla <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{a rich source}} of fatty acids, and contains both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids in perilla <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> mainly palmitic (5-7%) and stearic (1-3%). Monounsaturated fatty acids in perilla <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> oleic (12-22%), while polyunsaturated fatty acids in perilla <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> linoleic (13-20%), gamma-linolenic (0-1%), alpha-linolenic (54-64%), and arachidic (0-1%).|$|R

5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs boilers. Black smoke from burning <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of fireboxes and sudden backdrafts. For {{three and a}} half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard <b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Tung oil: The {{tung oil}} tree {{originates}} in southern China and was cultivated there for tung oil, but the date of cultivation remains unknown. During the Song Dynasty, tung <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> used for waterproofing on ships. Tung oil is etymologically derived from the Chinese tongyou.|$|E
50|$|Refined {{sunflower}} <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} low-to-extremely-high-temperature cooking. As a frying oil, it behaves {{as a typical}} vegetable triglyceride. Unrefined sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> a traditional salad dressing in Eastern European cuisines. Sunflower <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> also an ingredient in sunflower butter.|$|R
50|$|The {{higher the}} {{temperature}} {{to which the}} olive <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> heated, the higher the risk of compromising its taste. When extra virgin olive <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> heated above 210 - 216 C, depending on its free fatty acid content, the unrefined particles within the <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> burned. This leads to deteriorated taste. Also, the pronounced taste of extra virgin olive <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> not a taste most people like to associate with their deep fried foods. Refined olive <b>oils</b> <b>are</b> perfectly suited for deep frying foods and should be replaced after several uses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> bubblers <b>are</b> {{filled with}} mineral or {{silicone}} <b>oil.</b> These <b>are</b> both quite resistant to chemical attack. <b>Oil</b> bubblers <b>are</b> predominantly used; the <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> inexpensive and not toxic.|$|R
5|$|A fifth {{generating}} unit fueled by {{natural gas and}} <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> added to the Turkey Point generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed {{as the site of}} two new 1117MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.|$|E
5000|$|Sour crude <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> crude <b>oil</b> {{containing}} a high {{amount of the}} impurity sulfur. It is common to find crude oil containing some impurities. When the total sulfur level in the <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> more than 0.5% the <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> called [...] "sour".|$|R
5000|$|Linseed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> a triglyceride, {{like other}} fats. Linseed <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{distinctive}} for its unusually {{large amount of}} α-linolenic acid, which has a distinctive reaction with oxygen in air. Specifically, the fatty acids in a typical linseed <b>oil</b> <b>are</b> of the following types: ...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, peanut <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{recommended}} as {{the preferred}} oil to deep fry a turkey in. Aside from its delicious taste, peanut <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} healthiest <b>oils.</b> It <b>is</b> a vegetable <b>oil</b> that <b>is</b> naturally trans fat-free, cholesterol free, and low in saturated fats. Peanut <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> high in unsaturated fats, especially monounsaturated fat, like olive <b>oil.</b> It <b>is</b> also a source of the antioxidant, vitamin E and phytosterols, which benefit heart-health. Peanut <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> also a perfect choice for healthier frying {{because it can be}} heated to a higher temperature than other oils, and this results in lower oil pick up in the food.|$|R
5|$|Betelgeuse {{first put}} in at Vigo, Spain, to change {{some of her}} crew, and then sailed for Whiddy Island on 30 December 1978. During the passage, the vessel {{encountered}} heavy weather in the Bay of Biscay, and after reporting a leakage of <b>oil,</b> <b>was</b> instructed to head towards Brest, France, at reduced speed. However, {{the origin of the}} leak was discovered and stopped. The vessel proceeded on its original planned course, arriving in Bantry Bay on 4 January 1979.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the United States entered World War II in 1941, <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> a vital part of {{military}} operations around the world. The United States produced 60 percent of the world's crude oil, with the state of Texas in the south-west leading this production, producing {{more than twice as much}} crude as any other state. The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3,500 smaller operators.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009, Continental Airlines used a {{sustainable}} biofuel to power a commercial aircraft {{for the first}} time in North America. This demonstration flight marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants. The algae <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> provided by Sapphire Energy, and the jatropha oil by Terasol Energy.|$|E

50|$|Sesame <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> {{traded in}} any of the forms {{described}} above: Cold-pressed sesame <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> available in Western health shops. Unroasted (but not necessarily cold pressed) sesame <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> commonly used for cooking in South India, the Middle East, halal markets and East Asian countries.|$|R
5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> processed and sold in Canadian health stores.|$|E
5|$|Texas's large population, {{abundance}} of natural resources, thriving cities and leading centers {{of higher education}} have contributed to a large and diverse economy. Since <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> discovered, the state's economy has reflected {{the state of the}} petroleum industry. In recent times, urban centers of the state have increased in size, containing two-thirds of the population in 2005. The state's economic growth has led to urban sprawl and its associated symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The United States is {{the largest}} {{importer}} of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion. Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners. In 2010, <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest export. Japan {{is the largest}} foreign holder of U.S. public debt. The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold {{the majority of the}} debt.|$|E
50|$|Taramira oil or jamba <b>oil,</b> <b>is</b> a seed <b>oil,</b> pressed {{from the}} seeds of the arugula (Eruca sativa). Because the plant is highly drought resistant, the <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> popular in regions of poor rainfall, {{particularly}} in West Asia, Pakistan and Northern India. The <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> highly pungent and, upon extraction, acrid. The pungency differs from that of mustard oil, although taramira <b>oil</b> can <b>be</b> used to make a sort of mustard. In India, the <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> used for pickling, after aging to reduce the acridity, as a salad or cooking <b>oil.</b> The <b>oil</b> <b>is</b> also used as a massage oil and to soothe the skin. The seed cake, a byproduct of <b>oil</b> production, <b>is</b> also of use as animal feed.|$|R

5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard <b>Oil</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African Americans {{at the expense of the}} white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human {{use of oil}} reaches to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|While {{classified}} as generally recognized as {{safe in the}} US, juniper berries may have various side effects that have not been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper berries were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential <b>oil</b> <b>was</b> studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.|$|E
