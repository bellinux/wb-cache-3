5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable <b>oxidant.</b> Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an <b>oxidant</b> in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
5|$|Selenium deficiency, {{defined by}} low (<60% of normal) {{selenoenzyme}} activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues, occurs {{only when a}} low selenium level is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or increased <b>oxidant</b> stress from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Uranium hexfluoride is {{a highly}} {{corrosive}} substance. It is an <b>oxidant</b> and a Lewis acid which is able to bind to fluoride. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and {{is very difficult to}} handle on an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} begins when {{approximately}} 1,000Å of silicon dioxide has been grown on the silicon substrate. At this point, the silicon atoms {{are no longer}} exposed to the <b>oxidants</b> and the <b>oxidants</b> begin to diffuse through the silicon dioxide {{in order to reach}} the silicon. The oxidation of silicon during this stage occurs at the silicon/silicon dioxide interface. As oxidation continues, the silicon dioxide layer thickens, and the distance the <b>oxidants</b> must travel to reach the silicon increases. The oxide growth rate is limited by the diffusion of the <b>oxidants</b> through silicon dioxide.|$|R
40|$|Reproductive process {{leads to}} dynamic changes in {{metabolism}} and energy consumption, {{which may be}} responsible for the excessive production of free radicals (<b>oxidants)</b> that are generated during the physiological process of oxygen consumption. As the ovary is a metabolically active organ, it produces <b>oxidants.</b> Growing follicles, granulose cells of Graffian follicles and ovulated follicles all produce both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants to preserve themselves from the oxidative damage of <b>oxidants.</b> <b>Oxidants</b> and antioxidants are involved in several reproductive functions such as the regulation of follicular fluid environment, folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, corpus luteum function, and luteolysis. In this article, the currently available literature is reviewed in relation to the roles of <b>oxidants</b> and oxidative stress in both normal and abnormal reproductive physiological processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oxidants</b> {{and iron}} in chronic kidney disease. <b>Oxidants</b> derived either from leukocytes in proliferative glomerular nephritis or from {{resident}} glomerular cells in nonproliferative glomerulonephritis {{have been shown}} to have several biologic effects relevant to chronic kidney disease. These include: the ability of <b>oxidants</b> to damage glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and to directly induce proteinuria; effects that would lead to a fall in the glomerular filtration rate; and effects that would account for the morphologic changes observed in chronic kidney disease. In experimental models the role of <b>oxidants</b> has been demonstrated in both proliferative glomerulonephritis (e. g., anti-GBM antibody disease) as well as experimental models of minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy. <b>Oxidants</b> have also been shown to be an important mediator of the various pathways that have been implicated in diabetic nephropathy. Antioxidants and iron chelators have also been shown to retard functional and morphologic changes observed in progressive kidney disease. Taken together, these experimental studies suggest an important role of <b>oxidants</b> in chronic kidney disease...|$|R
5|$|Highly {{concentrated}} {{sources of}} oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, {{is needed to}} trigger combustion. Oxygen is the <b>oxidant,</b> not the fuel, but nevertheless the source {{of most of the}} chemical energy released in combustion.|$|E
5|$|In organic chemistry, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} used as an <b>oxidant,</b> for example as an {{alternative}} to the Sommelet reaction for oxidation of benzylic halides to aldehydes. It has also found use in the preparation of isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamates. Because of its toxicity it has largely fallen out of favour, but it still finds occasional use, for example as a bromide scavenger during SN1 substitution.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong <b>oxidant,</b> it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
50|$|Common <b>oxidants</b> used in {{this process}} are {{permanganate}} (both sodium permanganate and potassium permanganate), Fenton's Reagent, persulfate, and ozone. Other <b>oxidants</b> can be used, but these four are the most commonly used.|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV, λ = 172 nm) patterning of alkyl monolayer on silicon surface {{has been}} demonstrated with emphasis on the diffusion of VUV induced oxygen-derived active species, which are accountable for the pattern broadening. The VUV photons photo-dissociates the atmospheric oxygen and water molecules into the oxygen-derived active species (<b>oxidants).</b> These <b>oxidants</b> photo-oxidize the hexadecyl (HD) monolayer in VUV irradiated regions (Khatri et al., Langmuir. 24 (2008) 12077), {{as well as the}} little concentration of <b>oxidants</b> diffuses towards the masked areas. In this study, we performed VUV patterning at a vacuum pressure of 10 Pa to track the diffusion pathways for the <b>oxidants</b> with help of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs; = 10 nm) immobilization. At VUV irradiated sites AuNPs are found as uniformly distributed, but adjacent to the pattern boundary we observed quasi-linear arrays of AuNPs, which are determined by diffusion pathways of the <b>oxidants.</b> The diffusion of <b>oxidants</b> plays vital role in pattern broadening. The site selective anchoring of AuNPs demonstrates the utility of VUV photons for the construction of functional materials with microstructural architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{bronchial}} epithelium {{is exposed}} to <b>oxidants</b> from external environment. The main sources of exogenous oxidantsis the cigarette smoke (CS). Aldehydes and <b>oxidants</b> are main components of CS and induce apoptosis on lung cells. In asthmatic disease, the bronchial epithelium is susceptible to <b>oxidants</b> that cause apoptosis also in primary bronchial epithelial cultures. Caspases {{play a key role}} in apoptotic pathway and in particular Caspase- 3 is involved in apoptotic pathway. Then, it is possible that caspases are implicated in <b>oxidants</b> induced apoptosis of the bronchial epithelial cells? In the present review, we discuss the most recent molecular studies on this topic; their results can be also useful for therapeutic purpose...|$|R
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an <b>oxidant</b> mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an <b>oxidant</b> because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
25|$|Liquid oxygen {{is already}} {{used as an}} <b>oxidant</b> in rockets, {{and it has been}} speculated that red oxygen could make an even better <b>oxidant,</b> because of its higher energy density.|$|E
40|$|Mouse hindlimb {{ischemia}} {{has been}} widely used as a model to study peripheral artery disease. Genetic modulation of the enzymatic source of <b>oxidants</b> or components of the antioxidant system reveal that physiological levels of <b>oxidants</b> are essential to promote the process of arteriogenesis and angiogenesis after femoral artery occlusion, although mice with diabetes or atherosclerosis may have higher deleterious levels of <b>oxidants.</b> Therefore, fine control of <b>oxidants</b> is required to stimulate vascularization in the limb muscle. <b>Oxidants</b> transduce cellular signaling through oxidative modifications of redox sensitive cysteine thiols. Of particular importance, the reversible modification with abundant glutathione, called S-glutathionylation (or GSH adducts), is relatively stable and alters protein function including signaling, transcription, and cytoskeletal arrangement. Glutaredoxin- 1 (Glrx) is an enzyme which catalyzes reversal of GSH adducts, and does not scavenge <b>oxidants</b> itself. Glrx may control redox signaling under fluctuation of <b>oxidants</b> levels. In ischemic muscle increased GSH adducts through Glrx deletion improves in vivo limb revascularization, indicating endogenous Glrx has anti-angiogenic roles. In accordance, Glrx overexpression attenuates VEGF signaling in vitro and ischemic vascularization in vivo. There are several Glrx targets including HIF- 1 α which may contribute to inhibition of vascularization by reducing GSH adducts. These animal studies provide a caution that excess antioxidants may be counter-productive for treatment of ischemic limbs, and highlights Glrx as a potential therapeutic target to improve ischemic limb vascularization...|$|R

40|$|Exposure of Escherichia coli to H 2 O 2 {{leads to}} two kinetically {{distinguishable}} modes of killing: mode I killing occurs maximally near 2 mM H 2 O 2, whereas mode II killing is essentially independent of H 2 O 2 concentrations up to 20 mM. A {{major portion of}} H 2 O 2 toxicity is attributed to DNA damage caused by the iron-mediated Fenton reaction. By studying DNA damage during Fenton reactions in vitro, the same complex kinetics were observed and three types of <b>oxidants</b> were distinguished based upon their reactivities toward H 2 O 2 and alcohols and upon iron-chelator effects. Type I <b>oxidants</b> are sensitive to H 2 O 2 but moderately resistant to ethanol; type II <b>oxidants</b> are resistant to both H 2 O 2 and ethanol; type III <b>oxidants</b> are sensitive to H 2 O 2, ethanol, and t-butanol. To explain these results, we hypothesize that type I <b>oxidants</b> are generated upon Fe 2 + associated with DNA only through electrostatic interactions and cause mode I killing of E. coli; type II <b>oxidants</b> arise upon Fe 2 +, which is at least partially base-associated, and cause mode II killing; type III <b>oxidants</b> arise on Fe 2 + free in solution and probably do not cause killing. Therefore, particular interactions of DNA with transition metals should {{be considered to be}} an integral part of the chemistry and toxicity of H 2 O 2...|$|R
25|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} peroxide as an <b>oxidant</b> would be advantageous, making the reaction more environmentally friendly {{as the sole}} byproduct is water.

25|$|The atom or {{molecule}} which loses electrons {{is known}} as the reducing agent, or reductant, and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the oxidizing agent, or <b>oxidant.</b> Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an <b>oxidant</b> other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger <b>oxidant</b> (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.|$|E
40|$|Objective. We quantitatively {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} <b>oxidants</b> on antigen-antibody-binding activity. Methods. We used several immunological detection methods, including precipitation reactions, agglutination reactions, and enzyme immunoassays, to determine antibody activity. The oxidation-reduction potential was measured {{in order to determine}} total serum antioxidant capacity. Results. Certain concentrations of <b>oxidants</b> resulted in significant inhibition of antibody activity but had little influence on total serum antioxidant capacity. Conclusions. <b>Oxidants</b> had a significant influence on interactions between antigen and antibody, but minimal effect on the peptide of the antibody molecule...|$|R

30|$|In the {{oxidation}} duration, oxidation {{occurs at}} the edges of flake graphite first and then <b>oxidants</b> entered the interlayers. Oxide radicals induced cutting along the edges and surface defects of graphite [14]. Under the irradiation of microwave, expansible graphite expanded rapidly because of the decomposing of the <b>oxidants</b> between the layers. Compared with conventional expansion method, microwave irradiation is more economic and efficient. It could be confirmed that mild <b>oxidants</b> and microwave irradiation contributed to the expansion of the graphite flakes and ultrasonication helped to peel them into the thin graphene-like nanosheets.|$|R
30|$|Oxidative {{desulfurization}} {{has also}} been considered as a promising alternative to deep desulfurization of fuel [21, 26]. This process involves two steps, which are oxidation of sulfur compounds to sulfones or sulfoxides followed by extraction or purification. Usually, it is operated at ambient pressure and low temperatures (0 – 30  °C) using <b>oxidants</b> and any polar solvent. The widely used <b>oxidants</b> are hydrogen peroxide and peroxy-acids. However, the problem with using these <b>oxidants</b> is that they require to be added in high concentrations which then cause the loss of product quality and safety issues [27].|$|R

40|$|The {{neutrophil}} {{oxidative burst}} during inflammation is a {{main source of}} <b>oxidants</b> in vivo. As a result of neutrophil activation, the inflammatory <b>oxidants</b> produced include H 2 O 2 and chlorinated <b>oxidants</b> (HOCl and chloramines). These <b>oxidants</b> {{have been linked to}} endothelial dysfunction, a key component of various inflammatory diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis and obesity. The relevance of chloramines to inflammatory disease is an area of great interest. Some chloramines have been shown to traverse membranes and are cytotoxic, reacting with a number of cell components, with particular preference for Cys and Met residues. Understanding which cellular targets are preferentially oxidised by chloramines could provide important clues as to how endothelial dysfunction might be mediated in the context of inflammation. The aim of this thesis was to explore the cellular thiol targets HOCl and cell-permeable chloramines (glycine chloramine, GlyCl; and monochloramine, NH 2 Cl) in an endothelial cell model. Specifically, the focus was to investigate each <b>oxidant‘s</b> effects on cells grown in culture, with treatment exposure kept to a minimum in order to specifically identify early protein thiol modifications which coul...|$|R
