25|$|An {{oil spill}} near {{reactors}} 5 and 6 is detected at 8:00 am, {{as well as}} an explosion heard at 2:30 pm near reactor 4. TEPCO reports that the explosion was the bursting of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> damaged by unmanned machinery during debris removal.|$|E
25|$|The 827kg/1,823lb (normal) payload {{consisted}} of the fully equipped pilot (85kg/187lb), fuel (307kg/677lb), two Breda machine guns and two Mauser MG 151/20 cannon (60 and 84kg/130 and 185lb respectively), 740 rounds of 12.7mm (.5in) ammunition (76kg/168lb), 500 rounds of 20mm ammunition (100kg/220lb), and other sundry items such as oil (33kg/73lb), <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> (12kg/26lb) and radio equipment. Additionally, 100L (30US gal) fuel tanks or 160kg (350lb) of bombs could be carried on two underwing hardpoints. Due {{to a lack of}} passenger transport aircraft, modifications were made to a C.205 to enable it to carry eight passengers in the belly of the fuselage and, among others, three pilots of 51Â° Wing (including Adriano Visconti) made the journey from Sardinia to Italy after the Armistice in this manner.|$|E
25|$|The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, {{monoplane}} fighter, {{intended primarily}} as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, {{with the main}} fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The radiator was located under the centre section of the fuselage beneath the cockpit while the short rear section housed the radio equipment, <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> and an 80L (20US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. Veltros had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Manual {{material}} handling activities in {{long and short}} periods may lead to complications such as laceration, fracture, cardiovascular stress, muscle fatigue, and musculoskeletal disorders especially in the vertebrae column. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess manual handling of <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> by casting workers and to implement ergonomic intervention to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.. Material and Method: This is an interventional study conducted among 18 male workers of a steel casting unit. Assessment of manual handling of <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders,</b> was done using in order Snook tables. The manual handling of <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> was changed to mechanical handling and making a box with the capacity of 16 <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> which can be moved by crane.. Result: According to the results, lifting and lowering cylinders was not suitable for most of the workers. Moreover, caring, pulling and pushing was suitable for less than 10 percent of the workers. Condition of lifting cylinders by fire workers was suitable only 25 percent of them. According to the snook tables {{material handling}} activities must be suitable for at least 75 percent of workers.. Conclusion: With the implementation of ergonomic intervention is casting unit, the risk of exposure to musculoskeletal disorders caused by manual handling of <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> was eliminated and safety of employees against the risk of explosion of the cylinders in comparison with before the intervention was improved...|$|R

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} accident, the ATSB {{announced}} that air safety investigators {{found that an}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> which was located {{in the area of}} the explosion had not been accounted for, but that it was too early to say that an <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> could be the cause of the mid-air explosion on QF30. [...] Regardless, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority ordered Qantas to inspect all of its oxygen cylinders and brackets which hold the cylinders on its Boeing 747 fleet. The valve and mounting brackets were found, but not the bottle, number four of thirteen fitted in that bank. A senior investigator, Neville Blyth, reported that the cylinder valve was found inside the cabin, having punched a hole [...] "at least twenty centimetres in diameter" [...] through the cabin floor.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1961, in {{an attempt}} to extend the U-2's already {{considerable}} range, Lockheed modified six CIA U-2s and several USAF U-2s with aerial refueling equipment, which allowed the aircraft to receive fuel from either the KC-97 or from the KC-135. This extended the aircraft's range from approximately [...] and extended its endurance to more than 14 hours. The J57-powered U-2Bs were re-designated U-2E and the J75-powered U-2Cs were redesignated U-2F. Each modified U-2 also included an additional <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder.</b> However, pilot fatigue was not considered, and little use was made of the refueling capability. The only U-2H was both air refueling-capable and carrier-capable.|$|E
2500|$|... "After {{clearing}} the baggage and cargo from the forward aircraft hold, {{it was evident}} that one passenger <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> (number-4 from a bank of seven cylinders along {{the right side of the}} cargo hold) had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold, rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing-fuselage leading edge fairing. The cylinder had been propelled upward by the force of the discharge, puncturing the cabin floor and entering the cabin adjacent to the second main cabin door. The cylinder had subsequently impacted the door frame, door handle and overhead panelling, before falling to the cabin floor and exiting the aircraft through the ruptured fuselage." ...|$|E

5000|$|The British Royal Navy used it {{for many}} years. It was for {{underwater}} work rather than for combat diving. The main <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> are on the diver's back. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{at the front of}} the diver are for bailout. In its basic mode it was an oxygen rebreather; but some of the cylinders could be replaced by diluent cylinders for nitrox mode (which the Navy called [...] "mixture"), and then the set was sometimes called CDMBA. The Royal Navy was using nitrox from 1944, but did not reveal its nitrox techniques, and in the 1960s and afterwards civilian divers had to retread the same ground and develop nitrox diving independently. In later years it was called DSSCCD from [...] "Diving Set, Self-Contained, Clearance Diver".|$|R
2500|$|On 29 August, the ATSB gave {{an update}} {{confirming}} further {{aspects of the}} initial investigation. [...] They stated that these initial investigations had found that the aircraft took about {{five and a half}} minutes to descend from the decompression event at 29,000 feet to the altitude of 10,000 feet and that it appeared that part of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> and its valve had entered the passenger cabin, then impacted with the number 2 right door handle, turning it part way. [...] The ATSB noted that there was no risk of the door being opened by this movement, with the door systems performing as designed. [...] All three of the aircraft's instrument landing systems as well as the anti-skid braking system were unavailable for the landing; the pilots subsequently landed the aircraft without using those systems. Most of the oxygen masks deployed in the incident, with 426 out of the 476 deployed being activated by the 346 passengers, pulling them down to activate the flow of oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} B-58 {{design was}} the first [...] "true" [...] USAF supersonic bomber program. The Convair design {{was based on a}} delta wing with a leading-edge sweep of 60Â° with four General Electric J79-GE-1 turbojet engines, capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. Although its large wing made for relatively low wing loading, it proved to be surprisingly well suited for low-altitude, high-speed flight. It seated three (pilot, bombardier/navigator, and defensive systems operator) in separated tandem cockpits. Later versions gave each crew member a novel ejection capsule that made it possible to eject at an altitude of 70,000ft (21,000m) at speeds up to Mach 2 (1,320mph/2,450km/h). Unlike standard ejection seats of the period, a protective clamshell would enclose the seat and the control stick with an attached <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder,</b> allowing the pilot to continue to fly even [...] "turtled up" [...] and ready for immediate egress. The capsule would float, and the crewmember could open the clamshell, using it as a life raft. In an unusual test program, live bears and chimpanzees were successfully used to test the ejection system. The XB-70 would use a similar system (though using capsules of a different design).|$|E
