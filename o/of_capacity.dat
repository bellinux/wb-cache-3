40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the calculation method <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> for fire-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) beams, the reason of drop <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> was analyzed from material properties and transfer mechanisms of RC beams after fire. Formulas <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> were suggested for fire-damaged RC beams. Based on test analysis, the values of reduction factors <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> were proposed under concentrated load. The results show that suggested calculation method is capable <b>of</b> predicting shear <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> fire-damaged RC beams exactly. The values of reduction factors <b>of</b> shear <b>capacity</b> need further experiments research...|$|R

5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the faults lay in Siemen's 1992 take-over of MaK, in which {{a large number of}} veteran employees, who had the necessary competence to build diesel-locomotives, were retired. In 1998, Siemens sold the Kiel facilities to Vossloh. Following the return to Germany, the locomotives were modified to meet German standards and designed ME26. They were made narrower by removing outside stairs and railings, and moving lights to meet International Union of Railways standards. There were also changes to the cab walls, with internal railings added and the toilets removed. The speed was also reduced to , although this has later been reverted. Number 664 was rebuilt in Kiel, but because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> at MaK, the remaining units were rebuilt by DSB in Copenhagen. After the upgrades, ownership was transferred to Dispolok, a leasing pool originally owned by Siemens.|$|E
5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no automatic system to prevent the collision. The NTSB noted that had a positive train control system been in place on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: the system would have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. The NTSB argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E

40|$|We {{distinguish}} {{three classes}} <b>of</b> <b>capacities</b> on a C*-algebra: subadditive, additive and maxitive. A tightness notion for capacities, the vague and narrow topologies {{on the set}} <b>of</b> <b>capacities</b> are introduced. The vague space <b>of</b> additive <b>capacities</b> which are finite on compact projections is a non commutative version of the usual vague space of Radon measures on a locally compact Hausdorff space X. We give criterions of vague and narrow relative compactness in various classes <b>of</b> <b>capacities.</b> This allows us to extend most classical compactness theorems for Radon measures. The set of bounded (resp. tight) maxitive capacities is in bijection with the set of positive q-upper semicontinuous (resp. strongly q-upper semicontinuous) operators. This allows us to define a vague (resp. narrow) large deviation principle for a net <b>of</b> <b>capacities</b> as a vague (resp. narrow) convergence of this net towards a maxitive capacity, generalizing the classical notion for Radon probability measures on X. Next, we apply compactness theorems in order to extend some results in large deviations theory...|$|R
5|$|Operation of {{the system}} is {{subcontracted}} to Metro Service. Trains run continually, twenty-four hours a day, with the headway varying from two to four minutes, but with longer intervals (up to twenty minutes) during the night only. While a 6 train per hour (tph) service with 8-car trains, moves 48 cars per hour in each direction, Copenhagen Metro with 30 tph with 3 cars only, actually moves 90 cars per hour in each direction. So, in terms <b>of</b> <b>capacity,</b> the Copenhagen Metro is equivalent to a system with 8 cars and 12 tph (or a train every fifth minute).|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> reverse <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> a whole {{junction}} {{has been}} used extensively {{in the design of}} signal-controlled junctions. This concept, however, has not been applied to priority junctions and roundabouts, probably because of the complicated demand and supply relationship. When the demands on the approaches to the junction increase, the <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> those non-priority approaches reduce at different rates. This makes the calculation <b>of</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the whole junction not a straightforward task. Using the definition <b>of</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> a whole junction in Allsop (1972; Transpn Res. 6, 245 - 255), explicit formulae for the estimation <b>of</b> reserve <b>capacities</b> <b>of</b> priority junctions and roundabouts are derived in this paper.

5|$|The Taylor Report's {{requirement}} for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At {{the end of}} the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used {{for the first time on}} 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15percent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied. In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> by 255 to 75,957.

5|$|British Airways' {{main base}} is at London Heathrow Airport, {{but it also}} has a major {{presence}} at Gatwick Airport. It also has a base at London City Airport (LCY), where its subsidiary BA CityFlyer is the largest operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at Manchester Airport.

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie.

The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E
