Expressions are derived for the <b>OC</b> <b>curves</b> for several sets of general sets of three-stage chain sampling plans, with cumulative acceptance numbers of (c 1,c 2,c 3) = (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 4). In the original work of Dodge (1955) only acceptance numbers of 0, 1 were used and in the extension work of Dodge and Stephens (1966) acceptance numbers of (c 1,c 2) = (0,l), (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4) and (1, 4) were used with selected sets of values of k 1 and k 2 (the number of lots considered for cumulation in the first and second stage respectively).

Balasooriya & Saw (1998) present reliability sampling plans for the two-parameter exponential distribution, based on progressively censored samples. However, the operating characteristic (<b>OC)</b> <b>curve</b> derived in their paper {{does not depend on}} the sample size. This seems to be because, in their computations, they forget to consider the proportion of uncensored data, which also has an important influence on the subsequent developments.

40|$|An ‘operating characteristics’ (<b>OC)</b> <b>curve</b> is {{a simple}} tool {{that has been in}} use in quality control for many years but {{does not seem to be}} widely applied in the {{particulate}} sampling field. The <b>OC</b> <b>curve</b> provides the probability that a lot of material will be deemed to meet a specification (will be found to have an assay that falls above (or below) a specified level, given the true assay of the lot). In the application considered herein, it provides the probability that a grain shipment will be accepted, given the true value of the assay for the lot. It directly measures the probability of a type II error. To construct the <b>OC</b> <b>curve</b> for a given sampling protocol, it is necessary to know all the relevant components of variance and their distribution, as a function of the level of contamination in the shipment. This may be quite a challenge in many circumstances as the assumption of normality of distributions may be poor when dealing with substances such as mycotoxins. The paper introduces the method of <b>OC</b> <b>curve</b> construction and reviews the method developed by Whitaker for the construction of OC curves for mycotoxins in a wide range of commodities.

40|$|Background: Acceptance {{sampling}} is {{a statistical}} tool of quality control. Sampling plans and operating characteristic (<b>OC)</b> <b>curves</b> are very useful for conducting acceptance sampling {{and provide the}} quality manager with tools to evaluate {{the quality of a}} production run or shipment. There are developed different sampling plans, but common used in practise are single and double acceptance sampling plans. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to test if applying of single and double sampling plan can lead to statistically significant different conclusion about quality level of observed lot. Methods/Approach: Statistical tests of difference in proportions are used to test if there is some statistically significant difference in probabilities of lot fraction defectives between a single and a double sampling plan at the same levels of probability of acceptance. Results: The results of the analysis show that in some cases there is statistically significant difference. Namely, the quality manager should be careful when he chooses to use, instead of the first, the second sampling plan with different parameters because on that way he could make statistically significant different conclusion about quality level of observed lot. Conclusions: The paper shows that some intentional manipulations by using different sampling plans are possible...|$|R

In the manufacturing processes, this parameter in a production lot may not be precis ely known. Hence it is meaningful to treat such parameter as fuzzy quantities. In this paper we have argued for the acceptance double sampling plan when the proportion of defective items is a fuzzy number and it is being modeled based on the fuzzy Poisson distribution. The calculation of the Operating Characteristic (<b>OC)</b> <b>curves,</b> Average Sample Number (ASN) curves, Average Outgoing Quality (AOQ) curves and Average Total Inspection (ATI) curves of the plan will be presented for double plan by using the concept of fuzzy probability.

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{presented}} {{the results of}} the research of elements determining an operating characteristic (<b>OC)</b> <b>curve</b> of specified acceptance sampling plans and gave the evidence that certain relationships of direct or indirect proportionality among these elements existed. Relationships between sampling risks and other elements inbuilt in a single acceptance sampling plan were considered. Average Quality Level desired by the consumer (AQL), and quality level called Lot Tolerance Percent Defective (LTPD) or the worst level of quality that the consumer may tolerate, were both considered. The producer’s risk α was the risk that the sampling plan will fail to verify an acceptable lot’s quality set by AQL and, thus, reject it. The probability of acceptance a lot with LTPD quality was expressed as the consumer’s risk β. The <b>OC</b> <b>curve</b> pertained to a specific plan, i. e. to a combination of the sample size n and the acceptance criterion or level c.
