40|$|<b>The</b> {{multifaceted}} character <b>of</b> globalization constantly confuses {{our understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theoretical foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>legal</b> order. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common answers to <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> any such undertaking {{has been provided}} by international constitutionalists, who have advocated a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>legal</b> order that corresponds to a table of global values which echo the similar objective standards of domestic law. Liberals and neo-liberals have also floated value-based representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global order. This article {{is an attempt to}} challenge such Kantian or Grotian conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>legal</b> order with a view of laying out a neo Hobbesian understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common denominators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>legal</b> order, that is an international legal order based on (individual and common) interests rather than global values. Such a conception, as will be demonstrated, inevitably leads to relativism and entails an inextricable and continuous discussion about what constitutes the public good. Additionally, besides playing down <b>the</b> understandings <b>of</b> international law as a normative project, <b>the</b> interest-based conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>legal</b> order defended in this article fosters <b>the</b> transformation-capacity <b>of</b> international law, as it strips <b>the</b> latter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imperialistic and hegemonic overtones that are inherent to any value-based understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>legal</b> order...|$|R

5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city.

Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E
