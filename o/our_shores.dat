2500|$|Two {{days before}} the Republican {{convention}} in Chicago began its proceedings, Reese won a low-turnout senatorial closed primary victory over William Dane (1893-1966) of New Orleans. Reese received 762 votes; Dane, 278. Reese then attended the convention and thereafter campaigned across {{the state in the}} fall. In Lake Charles, he claimed that Senator Ellender had been lax in protecting military installations in Louisiana from being downsized or dismantled, with the impacted military services sent to bases in other states. [...] "There has been inadequate representation of the state in these matters," [...] Reese said. Ellender had been critical of the investigations into communist infiltration of the U.S. government waged in the 1950s by the late U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. Reese even accused Ellender of being [...] "soft on communism". The Democrat retorted that Reese's allegation came with [...] "ill grace for the spokesman for the member of a party (the Eisenhower administration) which has permitted the establishment of a Red-dominated beach head (Cuba) only ninety miles from <b>our</b> <b>shores</b> to attack my record against the spread of communism." ...|$|E

[...] From destructive fishing practices and exploitation of mineral resources to pollution and litter, evidence of human impact can be found in virtually all deep-sea ecosystems. [...] In response, the international community has set a series of ambitious goals aimed at protecting the marine environment and its resources for future generations. [...] Three of these initiatives, decided on by world leaders during the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg), are to achieve a significant reduction in biodiversity loss by 2010, to introduce an ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010, and to designate a network of marine protected areas by 2012. [...] A crucial requirement for implementing these is the availability of high-quality scientific data and knowledge, as well as effective science-policy interfaces to ensure the policy relevance of research and to enable the rapid translation of scientific information into science policy.|$|E

[...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. [...] We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. [...] So this is a just war [...] — [...] a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.″ ...|$|E
