5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|Persona was {{the first}} {{role-playing}} entry in the Megami Tensei series {{to be released in}} the west, with the first Megami Tensei release being action game Jack Bros. in 1995. While the main Megami Tensei series' use of Christian imagery made it unsuitable for localization at the time, Persona employed a different naming system to make it more acceptable. Persona was localized by Atlus' then-new North American branch Atlus USA. Persona was chosen as a series that could help define the company and compete with the likes of Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. The team that localized Persona was quite small, which made the process quite difficult: not only was there a large amount of text to translate, but the team needed to adjust <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> Japanese references as they feared it might alienate western players. Among the changes were altering the player character's hairstyle, the ethnic origins of multiple characters, the character and location names, and multiple pieces of dialogue. The entire Snow Queen route was also cut from the game, leaving only the SEBEC story route open for exploration.|$|E

Noise can block, distort, <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> meaning of a message in both human and electronic communication.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} {{parentheses}} in {{the definition}} {{is to ensure that}} any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition (in other words, there is a unique parse tree for each formula).

For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> places in which parentheses are inserted.

25|$|Towns {{are governed}} by Town Boards, with the board {{chairperson}} at its head. These boards normally consist of three supervisors, though towns with village powers or more than 2,500 people may have up to five supervisors. Town supervisors are elected every two years. Towns also have clerks, treasurers and assessors either elected or appointed by the board. In addition, every town must hold an annual town meeting {{in the beginning of}} April. At this town meeting, the electors may authorize the town board to take certain actions <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> make up or wages of town supervisors or officers.|$|E
25|$|Muslims {{believe that}} Gabriel brought {{the word of}} God to Muhammad verbatim, without any {{alteration}} <b>or</b> <b>change.</b> <b>The</b> Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text {{and that he had}} no authority to change it (10.15). It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. There is nothing in the Quran that suggests that Muhammad saw God during his revelations. For Muhammad, the revelations were real and he believed the context was objective, but he was only able to describe the experience through metaphorical terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{directional}} {{qualities of}} the radiogoniometer work in both directions; {{it can be used}} to determine the direction of an incoming signal, <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept the sky like a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific start signal, often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the start signal to the maximum in the continuous tone, and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle.|$|E

25|$|Politicizing Science: The Alchemy of Policymaking {{is a book}} by the George C. Marshall Institute, {{edited by}} Michael Gough. The book, {{published}} in 2003, encourages a disinterested objectivity {{on the part of}} scientists and policymakers: Ideally, the scientists or analysts who generate estimates of harm that may result from a risk would consider all the relevant facts and alternative interpretations of the data, and remain skeptical about tentative conclusions. Ideally, too, the agency officials and politicians, who have to enact a regulatory program, would consider its costs and benefits, ensure that it will do more good than harm, and remain open to options to stop <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> regulation in situations where the underlying science is tentative.|$|E
25|$|The first YDB-36H {{was flown}} on 3 July 1953. Six captive carry flights were flown between 31 July 1953 and 16 August 1953. The {{addition}} of the missile to the B-36 did not increase drag <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> handling characteristics of the bomber. An un-powered RASCAL was dropped from a YDB-36H on 25 August 1953. On 21 December 1954, a DB-36H was delivered to the Air Force {{for use in the}} RASCAL test program at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico in the United States. By June 1955, at least two missiles had been launched from the B-36 and Convair had completed manufacturing modification kits for the 12 planned aircraft. Two kits had been installed on B-36 aircraft when the USAF decided to carry the RASCAL only on the B-47 bomber.|$|E
25|$|Crushers {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} the size, <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> form, of waste {{materials}} so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or {{to reduce the size of}} a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by mechanical advantage through a material made of molecules that bond together more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or tangent solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil. Querns and mortars are types of these crushing devices.|$|E
