50|$|Over {{the active}} dynamic range of most films, {{the density of}} the {{developed}} film is proportional to the logarithm of the total amount of light to which the film was exposed, so the transmission coefficient of the developed film is proportional to a power of the reciprocal of the brightness of the <b>original</b> <b>exposure.</b> The plot of {{the density of the}} film image against the log of the exposure is known as an H&D curve. This effect is due to the statistics of grain activation: as the film becomes progressively more exposed, each incident photon is less likely to impact a still-unexposed grain, yielding the logarithmic behavior. A simple, idealized statistical model yields the equation , where light is proportional to the number of photons hitting a unit area of film, k is the probability of a single photon striking a grain (based {{on the size of the}} grains and how closely spaced they are), and density is the proportion of grains that have been hit by at least one photon. The relationship between density and log exposure is linear for photographic films except at the extreme ranges of maximum exposure (D-max) and minimum exposure (D-min) on an H&D curve, so the curve is characteristically S-shaped (as opposed to digital camera sensors which have a linear response through the effective exposure range. The sensitivity (i.e., the ISO speed) of a film can be affected by changing the length or temperature of development, which would move the H&D curve to the left or right (see figure).|$|E

International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether a refined assessment {{of exposure to}} bitumen fume among workers in the European asphalt industry within a nested case-control study resulted in a different interpretation pertaining to risk of lung cancer mortality compared with the cohort study. METHODS: Pearson correlation coefficients between refined and original estimates were calculated. Logistic regression and generalised additive models (penalised splines) were fitted to estimate ORs for exposure to bitumen fume using the refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates, respectively, while adjusting for potential confounding. RESULTS: 1555 subjects included in the nested case-control study had both refined and original estimates for exposure to bitumen fume. Exposure assessment in the nested case-control study (compared with the cohort phase) {{increased the number of}} subjects never-exposed to bitumen fume from 18 % to 32 %. From the 1282 subjects originally considered exposed in the cohort phase, 309 (24 %) became unexposed after the nested case-control exposure assessment. From the 273 subjects originally considered non-exposed in the cohort phase, 87 (32 %) became exposed in the nested case-control study. The majority (75 %) of subjects however did not change exposure status and changes were similar among cases and controls. Correlation coefficients between refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates were moderate overall (range 0. 42 - 0. 46), but varied considerably among countries. The ORs and exposure-response curves for exposure to bitumen fume were not meaningfully different between analyses that used refined and <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates. Adjustment for tobacco smoking and exposure to coal tar did not change these patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that more detailed data collection and exposure assessment in the nested case-control study compared with the cohort study did change exposure status of many subjects, but did not alter results of the exposure-response analysis.

First, we show that theoretically a stereo pair of parallelperspective mosaics is a good representation for an extended scene, and the adaptive baseline inherent to the geometry permits depth accuracy independent of absolute depth. Second, in practice, we have proposed a 3 D mosaicing technique PRISM (parallel-ray interpolation for stereo mosaicing) that uses interframe match to interpolate the camera position between the <b>original</b> <b>exposure</b> centers of video frames taken at discrete spatial steps. By analyzing the errors introduced by a 2 D mosaicing method, we explain why the &quot; 3 D mosaicing&quot; solution is important to the problem of generating smooth and accurate mosaics while preserving stereoscopic information. We further examine whether this ray interpolation step introduces extra errors in depth recover from stereo mosaics by comparing to the typical perspective stereo formulation. Third, the error characteristics of parallel stereo mosaics from cameras with different configurations of focal lengths and image resolutions are analyzed. Results for mosaic construction from aerial video data of real scenes are shown and for 3 D reconstruction from these mosaics are given. We conclude that (1) stereo mosaics generated with the PRISM method have significantly less errors in 3 D recovery (even if not depth independent) due to the adaptive baseline geometry; and (2) longer focal length is better since stereo matching becomes more accurate. 1...|$|E

The food consumption data covered 2, 038 adults (25 - 74 years old) and 1, 514 children of one, three, and six years of age, with the data on foods' acrylamide content obtained from published Finnish studies. We found that acrylamide exposure was highest among the three-year-old children (median: 1. 01 µg / kg bw / day, 97. 5 th percentile: 1. 95 µg / kg bw/ day) and lowest among 65 - 74 -year-old women (median: 0. 31 µg / kg bw/ day, 97. 5 th percentile: 0. 69 µg / kg bw/day). Among adults, the most important source of acrylamide exposure was coffee, followed by casseroles rich in starch, then rye bread.

In cultured myocytes, transitions in ATP synthase capacity (with no detectable change in cellular ATP concentration) accompany a change to anoxia or electrically stimulated contraction (rise of 70 %). These changes are reversed on returning to the <b>original</b> conditions. <b>Exposure</b> of myocytes to low pH has little effect on basal ATP synthase capacity (down to values less than pH 6), but markedly affects cellular ATP levels and the response of the cells to anoxia and reoxygenation, possibly mimicking changes seen in ischaemic heart. Similar effects are seen in suspensions of freshly prepared myocytes, but these preparations are less stable and more pH-sensitive than are cells in culture. It is proposed that mitochondria in vivo are directly regulated {{at the level of the}} ATP synthase, and that a regulator protein, the naturally occurring inhibitor protein from mitochondria, may be responsible for this regulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{delineate}} {{the impact of}} derivatives trading on asset risk for Canadian banks over the period starting 1997 till the fallout of the bank crisis in 2007. In light of the remarkable resilience of Canadian banks in dodging the current financial turmoil, we investigate whether such bank stability is attributable to effective risk management through derivatives use. After imputing asset risk from bank stock prices based on the option-theoretic model of Merton (1974), we ascertain the links between the implied asset risk and derivatives use for trading and hedging purposes. Our findings reveal that not only bank risk increases with trading in derivatives, but increases also with derivatives reportedly used for hedging. This puzzling evidence is robust to different model specifications and alternative methods of estimations. Our new evidence is important in two ways. First, it casts doubt {{on the effectiveness of}} hedge accounting. Second, it shows that the use of derivatives by Canadian banks does not explain their envied soundness. We therefore conclude that prudent practices limiting <b>original</b> risk <b>exposures</b> remain fundamental for safeguarding a healthy financial system. This lesson from Canada is particularly relevant for China, given its developing financial infrastructure and extreme reliance on banks in providing financing to its economy...|$|R
