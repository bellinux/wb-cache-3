25|$|Cast iron {{development}} lagged in Europe, as the smelters {{could only}} achieve temperatures of about 1000 C; <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> {{did not want}} hotter temperatures, as they were seeking to produce blooms as a precursor of wrought iron, not cast iron. Through {{a good portion of}} the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of iron blooms into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in Sweden, in two sites, Lapphyttan and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350. Some scholars have speculated the practice followed the Mongols across Russia to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis, and it would certainly not explain the pre-Mongol datings of many of these iron-production centres. In any event, by the late 14th century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the making}} of the pyramid itself there passed a period of 20years; and the pyramid is square, each side {{measuring}} 800feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than 30feet in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call 'rows' and others 'bases': When they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with devices made of short pieces of timber, lifting them first from the ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However, that may be, the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges.|$|E

500|$|Former {{president}} of the Czech Republic and writer Václav Havel characterized the phrase among [...] "commonly canonized demagogical tricks." [...] The Economist popularized the term whataboutism in a 2008 article, for the repeated usage of this rhetorical tactic by the Soviet Union. The magazine wrote that the tactic became overused, {{and by the time}} of the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, it had become a figure of speech referring to the entirety of Soviet propaganda. The book Exit from Communism edited by Stephen Richards Graubard made a similar point, that the term encapsulated an overall divorce from reality: [...] "Perhaps there are and perhaps there are not prison camps in Siberia, perhaps in the United States they do <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> do not lynch blacks... Ultimately it does not matter whether we are for real or just pretending: it is all just part of the story." [...] With the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president in 2008, The New York Times reported that the tactic could see decreased usage: [...] "In Russia, for example, where Soviet leaders used to respond to any American criticism of human rights violation with 'But you hang Negroes,' analysts note that the election of Mr. Obama removes a stain." [...] Journalist George Feifer recounted in a 2009 article how when he traveled to Moscow in 1959 to cover the American National Exhibition, he faced those using the phrase against him. Feifer wrote: [...] "Skilled propagandists stationed among the listeners regularly interrupted to repeat questions intended to discredit me. Why did America tolerate shameful poverty and lynch Negroes?" [...] In 2011, author Michael Dobson wrote that the phrase was a form of the pot calling the kettle black, and a [...] "famous example" [...] of the tu quoque reasoning derived from a [...] "famous 1960s era Russian joke." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{company did}} not give up, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> {{did not get the}} message from the council. A fresh {{proposal}} of extensions was drawn up [...] and put to the council on 13 November 1882. These included lines from Market Place to St. Ann's Well Road, Bridge Street Radford, Woodborough Road, Carlton Road, and across Trent Bridge - a length of 8 miles 6 furlongs, which would have taken the total network to 14 miles 8 furlongs 6 chains. On 4 December the Council was asked to support this application by unnamed promoters to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order to extend tramways but they refused. The tramways were the subject of debate at the next meeting on 8 January 1883 and it was resolved that the Corporation should purchase on equitable terms the tramway lines of the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited and should make all further extensions themselves, and lease the lines to a Company. The motivation for this was probably less to do with the series of disagreements between company and corporation that had been experienced since the lines opened, and {{more to do with the}} profitability of the company.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1840s {{a typical}} Merthyr {{family would be}} {{anything}} of up to four or five people; this was mainly due to more children surviving infancy, people living longer, immigration, and in particular large numbers of immigrants coming from Ireland fleeing the potato famine and unemployment that plagued their own country. In itself, the slum China saw at least 1,500 people congregated in its streets; stereotypically {{all of whom were}} [...] "unhappy and lawless". The slum's inhabitants were the poorest of society and had a bad reputation. Their living conditions were some of the most squalid in Britain. The slum was based around narrow streets, badly ventilated and full of crowded houses that led to festering diseases. China became known as [...] "Little Hell"’ and was notorious for having no toilets but open sewers which caused diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Lice were common, especially amongst workers who worked and slept {{side by side in the}} cramped conditions of the slum. These conditions were a concern for the health visitors and housing inspectors who visited its dirty streets. Some of the most memorable and detested dwellings in the slum were the cellars, which were mere one or two roomed houses close together, and often with an outrageous number of inhabitants. In the 19th century, people lived in cellars only if could not afford anything better; <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> preferred being within four cell walls as they had proper shelter and were fed daily.|$|E
2500|$|Chakraverti's public {{declaration}} {{that she was}} a [...] witch came at a time, when India still considered the word [...] "witch", taboo. Author Kumkum Bhandari said that [...] "Ipsita was a pioneer. Remember, call someone a 'witch' and you could be in for slander. Legally. But she was easily accepted. Partly because of her packaging and presentation—she is elegant, articulate and poised. People listen when she speaks. [...] Life and magic course through and around her. Being a witch is about ripping away layers of social conditioning, gender limitations and protective shields. It is, in a sense about moving towards being the complete and total woman. There is intensity, conviction and passion in the way Ipsita talks about witchcraft, or Wicca—the Craft of the Wise—and its relevance throughout history." [...] Chakraverti also observes that [...] "If I had come from a different rung of society, or was illiterate, the reaction wouldn't be the same. I have observed that it is always the person they will accept, and then the word Wicca. Witches are not born, they are made. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> sculpt themselves." [...] According to her, every strong woman can be considered a witch. [...] "A witch is the total woman. Strong daring women who have dared to live their own life, whatever it is. Jacqueline Kennedy, Indira Gandhi, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, Namita Gokhale, Kiran Bedi—all of them could count as witches." [...] Chakraverti has argued that Wicca is the first feminist movement in history and the oldest women-oriented branch of learning.|$|E
