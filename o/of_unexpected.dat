Stories <b>of</b> <b>unexpected</b> billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.|$|E

50|$|Tales <b>of</b> the <b>Unexpected</b> (Roald Dahl's Tales <b>of</b> the <b>Unexpected)</b> is a British {{television}} series which aired between 1979 and 1988. Each episode told a story, often with sinister and wryly comedic undertones, with an unexpected twist ending. Every episode of Series 1, eight episodes of Series 2 and one episode of Series 3 {{were based on}} short stories by Roald Dahl collected in the books Tales <b>of</b> the <b>Unexpected,</b> Kiss Kiss and Someone Like You.|$|R

5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance <b>of</b> <b>unexpected</b> visitors.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film is full <b>of</b> <b>unexpected</b> pleasures set to a surprisingly retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|When first {{proposed}} in the 2000s, the substation project was estimated to cost up to $150 million because of space limits and mitigation. The price rose to $174 million by 2014 after integration of public benefits and open space, {{as well as the}} relocation of the Amazon.com headquarters to nearby Denny Triangle. After the completion of design work and environmental cleanup in 2015, the substation's cost was revised to $210 million because <b>of</b> <b>unexpected</b> soil contamination and the need for newer electrical equipment.|$|E

5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences <b>of</b> <b>unexpected</b> shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they can contact AppleCare.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports <b>of</b> <b>unexpected</b> outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
