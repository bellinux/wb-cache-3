25|$|When Benaud won the toss on a {{pitch that}} looked rather inanimate most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thought</b> that Australia would {{probably}} get about 500 runs against an English attack {{which for the}} most part was devoid of fire, venom and guile. Previous matches had shown that the off-spinners might toil and spin but that they could not turn. Knight, always short of a length, should not on a good pitch worry any batsmen of even average class. Statham had seemed rather lethargic: certainly not the Statham of other years... Thinking over the game later on, one wondered how this bowling on a dead pitch succeeded in dismissing Australia for 404 runs.|$|E
500|$|Concerned {{about the}} plight of fellow ex-servicemen, whose {{businesses}} were often failing, Gellibrand banded together with like-minded individuals to form the Hobart Remembrance Club. This organisation aimed to support ex-servicemen by providing employment and support for their businesses. The Hobart Club inspired the formation of Legacy Australia in Melbourne, which over time became a national movement, expanding its scope to the care of ex-servicemen's widows and their families. The Hobart Club did not join Legacy until 1940, but Charles Bean wrote in 1944 that [...] "coming back to the great and good man from whose original work it all sprang—there was a time when some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thought</b> that the best monument to John Gellibrand might be the story of Second Bullecourt. Now I feel there will be an even better—the record of Legacy." ...|$|E

To celebrate the album's 10 year anniversary in 2016, the band went on tour performing the album in full. Hacikyan said: [...] "Growing up, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thought</b> we'd ever release a full length album, let alone have the chance to fly across the earth to headline a ten-year anniversary tour." [...] The band initially went on an Australian tour in August, which they hoped would lead to interest in a U.S. tour. Following contact with promoter Chris Ring, the band was hired by him as the first partner for his company Fanbassador. Fanbassador allowed the band to map out cities they could play based on audience demand. Eventually, they performed the album in 33 cities across the U.S. in October.|$|E

500|$|The {{paper has}} been {{questioned}} by palaeontologists such as Andrea Cau and Thomas Holtz, who point out that feathers in theropod dinosaurs can grow in the same {{parts of the body}} as scales (as seen in Juravenator), and thus the presence of scales does not actually eliminate the presence of feathers from that part of the body. Furthermore, feathers are delicate structures which can be very easily lost due to taphonomic factors. Paleontologist Mark Witton was warmer to the study, suggesting [...] "we have to concede a scalier appearance than many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thought</b> likely", while also highlighting that much remains to be determined about tyrannosaurid life appearance. Though acknowledging the role that taphonomy plays in interpreting dinosaur skin, Witton points out that the scale impressions are high quality, consistent in form across all patches, and show no obvious evidence of fibre impressions or spaces for filament attachment, despite the preservation of submillimeter scales. More variation and evidence of deformation might be expected if taphonomy had distorted the specimens in a significant way.|$|E
500|$|Robin Oliver of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Davies {{for taking}} [...] "an adult {{approach}} {{to one of}} television's most famous characters" [...] that children would appreciate, and that he reinvented {{it in a way}} that would be [...] "competitive in a high-tech market". Oliver also wrote that older viewers would find Eccleston [...] "easily the best time lord since Tom Baker". Reviewing the first episode, The Stages Harry Venning hailed it as a [...] "fabulous, imaginative, funny and sometimes frightening reinvention" [...] and particularly praised Rose for being an improvement upon previous female companions who were [...] "fit only to scream or be captured". However, he found Eccleston to be [...] "the show’s biggest disappointment" [...] as he looked [...] "uncomfortable playing fantasy". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan found the final episode anticlimactic, but overall said that the series was [...] "excellent Saturday night telly of the kind that many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>thought</b> the BBC had forgotten how to make". He praised Eccleston's performance and named [...] "The Empty Child" [...] and [...] "The Doctor Dances" [...] as the best episodes. Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the series a grade of A-, praising its variety. However, he was critical of Davies' [...] "annoying tendency to play to the lowest common denominator with toilet humor", but felt that from [...] "Dalek" [...] on the series was more dramatic and sophisticated.|$|E

The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating.
