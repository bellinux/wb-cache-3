25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of a duct due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other game modes, SSE has a team {{system for}} the {{characters}}, with a limited choice of characters {{at the beginning of}} the mode. Others join the team as the game progresses, while some characters may leave the team temporarily. Most characters start off with their own teams, but the teams merge occasionally until they become a unified team by the end of the game. In cooperative multi-player, once one player loses a life, an ally can take his or her place until the number of lives run <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> are no lives left and player one is defeated, the game is interrupted, with the choice of starting again from the previous [...] "door" [...] the player passed through or quitting.|$|E
500|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is tested {{by examining the}} tongue and its movements. At rest, if the nerve is injured a tongue may appear to have {{the appearance of a}} [...] "bag of worms" [...] (fasciculations) or wasting (atrophy). The nerve is then tested by sticking the tongue <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> is damage to the nerve or its pathways, the tongue will usually but not always deviate to one side. [...] When the nerve is damaged, the tongue may feel [...] "thick", [...] "heavy", or [...] "clumsy." [...] Weakness of tongue muscles can result in slurred speech, affecting sounds particularly dependent on the tongue for generation (i.e., lateral approximants, dental stops, alveolar stops, velar nasals, rhotic consonants etc.). Tongue strength may be tested by poking the tongue against the inside of their cheek, while an examiner feels or presses from the cheek.|$|E

500|$|Director John Woo has {{described}} The Killer as being about [...] "honour and friendship", [...] "trying to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is something common between two people" [...] {{and as a}} [...] "romantic poem". The structure of the film follows two men {{on opposite sides of}} the law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine. Woo recalled [...] "When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, but deep in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that." [...] Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo's film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating [...] "People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege. It's certainly not intentional." ...|$|E
500|$|Awaking {{from his}} nap, Brian decides {{to drink a}} bottle of scotch that he had stored in his safety deposit box. He offers Stewie a sip, and they both become so drunk that Brian agrees to pierce Stewie's ear with a pin from his sweater, leaving Stewie with a bloody ear {{for the rest of}} the episode. Stewie and Brian discuss The Dog Whisperer and Cesar Millan, and Brian {{explains}} that he is inspired by the philosophy about dogs' instinctive ability to live in the present and with purpose. Stewie, however, points out that Brian himself does not appear to live with any specific purpose. Angered at the implication, Brian begins insulting Stewie, who bitterly retaliates by revealing that he could have gone all day without having his diaper changed, and only thinks of Brian as a passing amusement and [...] "the best of a bad situation". Stewie dares Brian to shoot him with the revolver in the deposit, which Brian earlier said to be bullet-free. It is revealed that Brian lied, and he attempts to shoot Stewie. The two then find a security camera hanging on a wall of the vault. Brian tries to use it to call for help, but Stewie points <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was someone out there, they would have been saved. Brian then realizes that the camera has recorded him cleaning Stewie, which amuses the infant, but Brian is upset about gaining a laughingstock reputation. Stewie then prematurely causes the gun to discharge, causing the bullet to randomly ricochet off the vault walls, smashing Stewie's already-broken phone and the bottle of Scotch, and forcing the two under the table.|$|E

2500|$|While {{waiting for}} equipment, the divers began {{knocking}} {{the bottom of}} the pusher to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was anyone trapped inside the capsized vessel and shortly afterwards established contact with the chief engineer and the chief officer. Shouting through the bottom, the divers told the trapped crew members that they were attempting to dive into the engine room from outside, after which those inside asked if it was possible to cut a hole to the bottom. When they were told that the rescuers were not sure yet if it was safe, the crewmen informed the divers that they were not in immediate danger although the air was becoming hard to breadth due to oil fumes. After diving inside the vessel was deemed to be impossible due to the heavy seas and the slight movement between the pusher and the barge indicated that the vessel was grounded and thus not in danger of sinking, it was decided to make a hole to the bottom to rescue the trapped crew members.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Psylocke {{appears as}} a member of Magneto's X-Men branch to protect mutantkind at all costs after Terrigen mixes with the {{atmosphere}} and changes its structure, becoming toxic to mutants as a result. Psylocke has complete telepathic control over Archangel, who is now mentally a blank slate, and utilizes him as a heavy hitter for the X-Men on various missions. Although she does not fully trust Magneto or agree with his methods, she remains with him for the sake of finding <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is any trace of Warren left inside of Archangel. The more she probes Archangel's blank mind in order to find out what is wrong with him, the more she begins to worry that his Dark Angel persona may resurface as she begins to see visions of destruction in his head. After considering her vision as a warning from Warren about what is to come she and Magneto travel to a Green Ridge, Colorado where her vision took place and she finds Warren preaching to a church group. After following him around town, she and Magneto end up caught in a trap created by the Clan Akkaba who seek to create clones of Archangel. Psylocke then battles the clones to protect the citizens of Green Ridge and watches as Warren merges with them to create a brand new Angel.|$|E
2500|$|The Decision Review System has {{generally}} received positive response from {{players and coaches}} since its launch, however {{there have been some}} criticisms as well. West Indies legend Joel Garner labelled the system a [...] "gimmick". Another West Indian Ramnaresh Sarwan said that he was not a supporter of the experimental referral system. Former umpire Dickie Bird also criticised the system, saying it undermines the authority of on-field umpires. The cricketing board of India has expressed a skeptical view on the adoption of the system if it is near perfect. Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal expressed dissatisfaction over the Decision Review System after a semi-final of the 2011 Cricket World Cup against India. He said that DRS showed the line of the ball deviating more than it actually did. Hawk-Eye officials admitted in December 2014 that their review technology made an error in a decision to give Pakistan opener Shan Masood out in the second Test against New Zealand in Dubai (17-21 November 2014). At a meeting held at the ICC office in Dubai two weeks later, Hawk-Eye is understood to have conceded to Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq and team manager Moin Khan that the projection used by their technology for the Leg before wicket decision was incorrect. Also, a challenge can only be made by the captain within a 15-second window from when an initial decision is made, but it can be lengthened if no clear decision is made, especially they are assumed not <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is no reaction by the umpire.|$|E

2500|$|Indirect discrimination, after {{a neutral}} {{practice}} puts {{a member of}} a group at a particular disadvantage, is not made <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is an [...] "objective justification". In most cases, this will be a justification based on business necessity. The ECJ, mostly in cases concerning sex discrimination under TFEU art 157, has held that an employer must show a [...] "real need" [...] for the practice that has a disparate impact, and it must be [...] "unrelated" [...] to the protected characteristic. The justification should not involve [...] "generalisations" [...] rather than reasons specific to the workers in question, and budgetary considerations alone are not to be considered an [...] "aim". Many foundational judgments concerned employers who gave fewer benefits to part-time staff than full-time staff. Given the particular disadvantage this caused women it was hard to justify. In domestic equal pay claims based on gender, instead of [...] "objective justification", the old terminology still used is that there must be a [...] "genuine material factor", found in EA 2010 section 69. Despite different headings, the same underlying concepts are present as for objective justification, with the need to show a [...] "legitimate aim" [...] and that action is [...] "proportionate" [...] to such an aim. In Clay Cross (Quarry Services) Ltd v Fletcher Lord Denning MR held that an employer could not justify paying a young man a higher wage than an older lady (who in fact trained him) on the basis that this was what the employer had to pay given the state of the job market. However, in Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board the House of Lords held that women NHS prosthetists who were paid 40% less than men prosthetists, who had become contracted through private practices, had no claim because it was agreed that such higher prices were necessary to attract their services. Thus, the [...] "objective justification" [...] was said to be an organisational necessity. In Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority the ECJ held that although a speech therapist being paid less than a male counterpart could not be justified only on the ground that this resulted from different collective agreements, if a disparity came from market forces, this was an objective justification. It has, however, been emphasised that the legislation's purpose is to achieve equal pay, and not fair wages. So in Strathclyde RC v Wallace the House of Lords held that women teachers who had to fill in for an absent male head master were not entitled to be paid the same during that time. This was a different job. It has also been asserted that collective agreements designed to incrementally make a transition to equal pay between jobs rated as equivalent cannot be justified, and can even result in liability for the union that concluded them. Unlike other protected characteristics, under EA 2010 section 13(2), direct age discrimination is open to justification on the same principles, on the basis that everyone will go through the ageing process. This has meant, primarily, that older workers can reach a compulsory retirement age set either by the workplace or the government, on the basis that it is a legitimate way of sharing work between generations.|$|E
