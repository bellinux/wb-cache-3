50|$|Xak II, being {{a direct}} {{sequel to the}} first game in the series, it {{features}} the same high fantasy setting as Xak. The gods' division of the world into Xak, the world of men, <b>Oceanity,</b> the world faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons, as referenced in Xak, is depicted in this game's introduction. In this adventure, the main hero of the Xak series, Latok Kart is exploring a vast region situated around a single central village of Banuwa.|$|E
50|$|Xak {{features}} a typical high fantasy setting. According {{to the game}} world's legends, a great war was fought between the benevolent but weakening ancient gods and a demon race, {{which led to the}} collapse and eventual mortality of the gods. After this 'War of Sealing', the gods divided the world into three parts: Xak, the world of humans, <b>Oceanity,</b> the world of faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons. The demon world of Xexis was tightly sealed from the other two worlds as to prevent reentry of the warmongering demon race. Some demons were left behind in Xak, however, and others managed to discover a separate means to enter Xak from Xexis anyway.|$|E

40|$|Conceptually, the {{influence}} of oceans and continents plays key roles in the climate of any region. This study considers continentality and <b>oceanity</b> thermal climate index and focuses on the synoptic classification of Pakistan. The country has a diversified geographic relief which has profound influence on its climate from region to region. While its more than 990 km long coastal belt has wetter maritime condition, its interior belt is under {{the influence}} of arid and semi arid conditions and its higher altitude region has a hyper-arid climate. Marsz, also called Kerner <b>Oceanity</b> and Conrad Continentality Indices were calculated for Pakistan using the country’s temperature annual range data of the past fifty years (1961 - 2010) at 51 climate stations. When correlations between the two continental indices are compared, it indicates that a large area of Pakistan has continental climate. This comparison may be beneficial for Pakistan’s energy reforms and agricultural sectors...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasion}} {{process can}} be divided into several phases. We consider invasion patterns related to two aspects of the invasion process: the spread of a species in Germany as counted by the number of occupied grid cells, and the degree of naturalization in Germany (i. e. whether a plant species is exclusively naturalized in human-made habitats or also in (semi-) natural habitats). Although in Germany the area of natural habitats is smaller than that of human-made habitats, the area of occupancy of the respective alien plant species is the opposite. We tested whether both patterns could be explained by niche-breadth variables, namely the number of inhabited habitat types, and vegetation formations, the range of human impact levels, the number of inhabited continents, the number of inhabited floristic zones (climatic zones), and the amplitude of <b>oceanity.</b> Tests were conducted across species and across phylogenetically-independent contrasts, using generalized linear models, in particular, hierarchical partitioning. The number of occupied grid cells could be explained by niche-breadth variables, especially by number of habitats, number of formations, and amplitude of <b>oceanity.</b> Contrary to our expectations, none of these variables could explain the degree of naturalization in cross-species analyses, and amplitude of <b>oceanity</b> is the only stably significant variable that explains the degree of naturalization when analysing phylogenetically-independent contrasts. We conclude that the degree of naturalization is probably independent from niche breadth, and that properties of a larger area of occupancy, i. e. sample size (or propagule pressure), could be responsible for this pattern...|$|E
40|$|Five {{indices of}} thermal {{continentality}} {{were computed for}} 84 stations in Europe and shown in the maps. The thermal continentality in Europe is spatially variable and increases eastward and southward from the northwestern shores towards Asia. Continental features are distinct {{in the interior of}} the Iberian Peninsula and in the northeastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, despite their small distance from the Atlantic Ocean. Most continentality indices (Chromow’s, Ewert’s, Conrad’s, Johansson-Ringleb’s) reveal a similar spatial pattern of thermal continentality in Europe, and they allow the continent to be divided into a western and eastern part along meridian 20 – 25 °E. Marsz’s index, which takes into consideration the level of <b>oceanity,</b> indicates a narrow zone along the northwestern shore as oceanic and the remaining part of Europe as continental. 617118213 Badania Fizjograficzn...|$|E
30|$|In the {{publication}} by Kirschbaum and Wirth, {{an index of}} climate change, the climate index ‘KI’, was introduced[11]. It {{is a combination of}} both the indicator values for temperature and <b>oceanity</b> (the latter is complementary to the indicator value for continentality) and thus integrates the statements of both values. The climatic values are averaged and a climate index (KI) for every measuring unit is calculated. Since the heat indicators are still relatively rare and occur with less frequency on the trees, a weighting of the results in the calculation of the KI - according to the frequency of their occurrence - was omitted. (Because of their low frequency, their values would not influence the results in comparison to the other mostly common species.) Moreover, in this way it was possible to calculate an unweighted index for 1970; a calculation of a weighted index was not possible due to methodological reasons.|$|E
40|$|This thesis enquires {{into the}} spatial {{variability}} of precipitation annual cycles and its representation by regional climate models. Goal {{is to find}} suitable metrics that could describe spatial character of the precipitation field and consequently evaluate model results. For complete understanding the issue, there is an introduction to modeling with regional climate models and also parameters of the precipitation in the Czech Republic. The {{main part of the}} thesis is an application of different methods of descripiton on the results of the regional climate models (including the Czech model ALADIN) and CRU data. Results of the models are compared to observed data transferred into the regular grid. Each method is applied on the model results and assessed with regard to advantages and disadvantages. The metrics that were found useful are recommended for the further evaluation of the spatial variability of precipitation annual cycles. The ALADIN model seems to be quite successfull, weak points are only modelling of the precipitation in spring and the effect of the continentality and <b>oceanity</b> on the precipitation annual cycles.

40|$|A {{long-term}} (1960 - 2013) {{assessment of}} the variability of continentality and aridity conditions over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region was undertaken. Monthly gridded temperature and precipitation data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) (TS 3. 22 version) were used to compute the Johansson Continentality Index (JCI) and the Marsz <b>Oceanity</b> Index (MOI). In addition, the De Martonne index and the Pinna index were employed to assess recent changes in aridity conditions. All indices revealed a statistically significant increase in continental influences over the region, particularly in the Nile Basin and the Fertile Crescent. For aridity, the results suggested a generally statistically insignificant increase, with the most rapid changes occurring over the most humid regions (i. e. the Ethiopian Highlands and the Fertile Crescent). In order to explain the observed changes in the continentality and aridity conditions, we assessed the relationship between aridity and continentality indices and {{a wide range of}} large-scale circulation patterns. Results indicate that the spatial variability of continentality (as well as aridity) was closely coupled with the Atlantic modes of variability, e. g. the Eastern Atlantic pattern and the Atlantic Meridional Mode, compared to those of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. The results of this work highlight change processes in 2 important climate features in one of the hottest regions on Earth. Improving our understanding of the spatio-temporal characteristics of climate continentality and aridity has implications for a diversity of socio-political, economic, hydrological, and ecological activities in the MENA region...|$|E
