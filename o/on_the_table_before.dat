500|$|In the 2007 Super 14 season, seven Crusaders players {{missed the}} first seven rounds of the {{competition}} {{to participate in an}} All Black [...] "conditioning programme". The conditioning programme was part of the All Blacks' 2007 Rugby World Cup preparations; 22 players were selected for the programme. The Crusaders' seven players in the programme was more than any other New Zealand Super 14 franchise. The Crusaders players were Chris Jack, Richie McCaw, Greg Somerville, Reuben Thorne, Dan Carter, Leon MacDonald, and Aaron Mauger. All but one of the seven returned to play for the Crusaders in their eighth round match against the Stormers (Greg Somerville did not return due to injury). The Crusaders climbed to second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> defeating the Western Force 53–0 at Jade Stadium in the tenth round. The victory over the Force was the one hundredth Super rugby win for the Crusaders – the first franchise to reach the milestone.|$|E
2500|$|Crandon's [...] "teleplasmic hand" [...] that {{allegedly}} appeared in photographs {{was said to}} resemble animal tissue and trachea, cut and sewn together. Allegations were made by some conjuring historians of Houdini and mediumship that her surgeon husband had altered her genitalia and this was where she concealed her teleplasmic hand. The [...] "hand" [...] did not move after its appearance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> her. It lay still {{as if it were}} dead and then supposedly vanished. She refused to wear tights, or to be internally searched, but no proof that Crandon had been surgically altered has ever been published. The [...] "hand" [...] appeared only when Crandon sat next to her husband, who held or controlled her right hand.|$|E
6000|$|After {{preparing}} a new slate {{she put it}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> as <b>before,</b> saying to the air, [...] "Please don't be rough, father--Victor can't prevent his skepticism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never clapped eyes on him," [...] was the reply. [...] "But I {{read some}} of his poetry out of that book there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> just <b>before</b> you come in. How do you like his poetry?" ...|$|R
60|$|Our visitor's {{face had}} turned ashen gray {{as he listened}} to the words of his accuser. Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands. Then with a sudden {{impulsive}} gesture he plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rustic <b>table</b> <b>before</b> us.|$|R
2500|$|One motion, the {{so-called}} Hamilton-Proctor motion, involved the forensic ballistic evidence {{presented by the}} expert witnesses for the prosecution and defense. The prosecution's firearms expert, Charles Van Amburgh, had re-examined the evidence {{in preparation for the}} motion. By 1923, bullet comparison technology had improved somewhat, and Van Amburgh submitted photos of the bullets fired from Sacco's [...]32 Colt in support of the argument that they matched the bullet that killed Berardelli. In response, the controversial self-proclaimed [...] "firearms expert" [...] for the defense, Albert H. Hamilton, conducted an in-court demonstration involving two brand new Colt [...]32-caliber automatic pistols belonging to Hamilton, along with Sacco's [...]32 Colt of the same make and caliber. In front of Judge Thayer and the lawyers for both sides, Hamilton disassembled all three pistols and placed the major component parts – barrel, barrel bushing, recoil spring, frame, slide, and magazine – into three piles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> him. He explained the functions of each part and began to demonstrate how each was interchangeable, in the process intermingling the parts of all three pistols. Judge Thayer stopped Hamilton and demanded that he reassemble Sacco's pistol with its proper parts.|$|E

60|$|I obeyed him; {{then he put}} <b>the</b> glass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> stood <b>before</b> me, {{and looked}} at me attentively. Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden. I turned my face away and put his aside.|$|R
40|$|She {{took out}} the jar of cold cream and set it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{dressing}} <b>table</b> <b>before</b> her and looked in the mirror. She had looked good tonight. She had meant to look good. It was her husband 2 ̆ 7 s first night home. Not her husband [...] . Not her husband. She wished she would look old. She took the shades off the lamps. That was better. She looked worse...|$|R
5000|$|Towards the end, Michaels hit Sweet Chin Music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside, leaving Undertaker lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{broadcast}} <b>table,</b> <b>before</b> {{performing a}} top-rope moonsault, breaking <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> At <b>the</b> {{end of a}} 24-minute match, after kicking out of a Tombstone Piledriver, Michaels slapped The Undertaker, leading to Undertaker executing a jumping Tombstone Piledriver on Michaels. As {{a result of the}} loss per the pre-match stipulations, Michaels retired from professional wrestling, a moment described as [...] "the end of an era".|$|R

6000|$|... 2. But {{they were}} a type of the true church, not of the false. For Ephraim, who {{was the head of}} the ten tribes in their apostacy, is rejected, as 'a cake not turned.' Indeed he is called a cake, as a false church may be called a church: but he is called 'a cake not turned,' as a false church is not {{prepared}} for God, nor fit to be set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> golden <b>table</b> <b>before</b> him (Hosea 7:8).|$|R
6000|$|The two men whispered together. The girl {{stole from}} her place {{and turned over}} rapidly {{the pages of a}} {{directory}} which was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> round <b>table</b> <b>before</b> her. She found the [...] "A's" [...] quickly. Her eye fell upon the name of Ashleigh. She repeated the address to herself and glanced around. The two men were still whispering. For the moment she was forgotten. She stole <b>on</b> tiptoe across <b>the</b> room, ran down the stone steps, and hastened into the street.|$|R
5000|$|When {{he arrived}} in her room, she shot him with a [...]22 caliber rifle, the bullet barely missing his heart. She {{immediately}} called the desk to report the shooting and was found cradling his head in her lap. [...] Waitkus nearly died several times <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operating <b>table</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> bullet was successfully removed. Steinhagen never stood trial but instead was briefly confined to a mental institution. The incident is discussed at length {{in one of the}} Fireside Book of Baseball entries.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ravenor took up {{some papers}} lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> him {{and began to}} sort them.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} the Sixth Form, as usual, went into the library to do their construing. Dr. Litter, {{according}} to his usual custom, {{walked up and down}} hearing them and asking questions, the form sitting at their desks, which ran round the room. The Doctor was a fidgety man, and was always either twirling his watch-chain or eye-glass, or rattling the keys, knife, and other articles in his trousers pockets. Being perfectly conscious of the habit, he often emptied the contents of his pocket <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> starting to walk about the room, and this he did <b>on</b> <b>the</b> present occasion.|$|R
50|$|The {{book ends}} {{a few weeks}} later, with Ning, Ryan, James and James' girlfriend Kerry Chang (also a major {{character}} in the first 12 books) sitting down to watch a preview of a BBC Panorama programme that is due to go out soon about the Crewdsons and the drug scandal surrounding them. The epilogue is also about Fay, as she sneaks into a luxury health resort where Hagar is staying, and kills him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> massage <b>table,</b> <b>before</b> heading back outside to join Warren, {{and the two of}} them ride away on a bike together.|$|R
50|$|Sailing <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> boat is washed into a canal, {{where the}} tin soldier is {{swallowed}} by a fish. When this fish is caught and cut open, the tin soldier finds himself once again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> top <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ballerina. Inexplicably, the boy throws the tin soldier into the fire, {{which is most}} likely a work of the goblin. A wind blows the ballerina into the fire with him; she is consumed by it. The maid cleans the fireplace {{in the morning and}} finds the soldier melted into a heart, along with the ballerina's spangle, which is now burned black as coal.|$|R
60|$|With that reply Mr. Delamayn took {{a written}} paper from his pocket, {{and spread it}} out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>before</b> him.|$|E

60|$|Seated at his ease in {{the warm}} tap-room of the Cauliflower, the {{stranger}} had been eating and drinking for some time, apparently unconscious {{of the presence of}} the withered ancient who, huddled up in that corner of the settle which was nearer to the fire, fidgeted restlessly with an empty mug and blew with pathetic insistence through a churchwarden pipe which had long been cold. The stranger finished his meal with a sigh of content and then, rising from his chair, crossed over to the settle and, placing his mug <b>on</b> <b>the</b> time-worn <b>table</b> <b>before</b> him, began to fill his pipe.|$|R
5000|$|On August 8, 2010, Britain's tabloid Sunday Express cited an {{unidentified}} [...] "source close to MI6" [...] as saying, [...] "There was a deal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> just <b>before</b> she caught her connecting flight to Moscow. The secret service intercepted {{her on her}} flight back from America to Vienna, where her plane landed to refuel. MI6 were keen to know about other ‘illegals’—Russian spy cells—hiding in Britain, so they made her an offer. In return they offered to give her back British citizenship and allow her to settle in London. Anna was having none of it though and told them {{in no uncertain terms}} that she wished to return to Russia." ...|$|R
50|$|The 2010 and 2011 campaigns {{took on a}} {{familiar}} path. With David Large taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coaching role from the departing McLaren the club finished both seasons in second position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> league <b>table</b> <b>before</b> going <b>on</b> to host <b>the</b> Grand Finals and losing each one by an identical scoreline, 1-0 to Sunshine Coast F.C.. The 2012 QSL {{proved to be a}} successful season for the club. The Strikers claimed their second QSL championship in five years in emphatic fashion, finishing eight points above second place Far North Queensland Bulls FC. However the Strikers finals curse struck yet again being eliminated in a home semi-final 2-0 to Whitsunday Miners FC.|$|R

60|$|It was {{a ghastly}} sight. There {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> long stone <b>table,</b> holding in his {{skeleton}} fingers a great white spear, sat Death himself, shaped {{in the form of a}} colossal human skeleton, fifteen feet or more in height. High above his head he held the spear, as though in the act to strike; one bony hand rested <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>table</b> <b>before</b> him, in <b>the</b> position a man assumes on rising from his seat, whilst his frame was bent forward so that the vertebræ of the neck and the grinning, gleaming skull projected towards us, and fixed its hollow eye-places upon us, the jaws a little open, as though it were about to speak.|$|R
50|$|The Ghost of Christmas Future showed her, Sam and Kieron {{three years}} from now. Maria and Sam were married, and {{living and working in}} a {{hospital}} in New York. Maria was also expecting a baby, but Kieron was devastated that Maria had married Sam. He was so hurt that Maria and Sam had lied to him about their relationship that he refused to play the violin again, smashing the instrument to pieces in front of her. When Maria told Kieron that she had only ever loved him as a son, he deliberately stepped out in front of a truck. Kieron was rushed into hospital, but died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operating <b>table</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> eyes of his father and stepmother.|$|R
