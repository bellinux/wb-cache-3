50|$|In the UK, {{technological}} {{improvements and}} economic pressure {{have made some}} trains lose their guards and become driver-only operated (DOO). British Rail first brought this in on some commuter services in London and Glasgow, {{as well as on}} almost all non-passenger trains. In 2003, a controversial amendment to the UK <b>operational</b> <b>rule</b> book moved part of the guard's safety and operational role to the Driver. With rail service privatisation, train operating companies (TOC) attempted to bring in DOO to other network areas—c2c operating from London Fenchurch Street is an example of this. Pressure after several fatal train crashes reversed this trend to the point that some TOCs have restored guards to services previously stripped of them, First Great Western did this to certain services it acquired when it took over operation of Thames Trains. Currently, several titles describe a guard: train manager, train host, conductor, and South West Trains and Merseyrail still use the term guard. The role of the guard is set out by a mixture of the Railway Rule Book and Train Operating Companies.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an innovative streamflow process model {{for use in}} reservoir <b>operational</b> <b>rule</b> design in stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Model features, which can be applied independently, are (1) a multiplicative process model for the forward phase and its linearized version for the backward phase; and (2) a nonuniform time-step length that is inversely proportional to seasonal variability. The advantages are (1) guaranteeing positive streamflow values still maintaining problem linearity, and (2) making system adaptation faster during high variable periods. Model identification is straightforward, as with the additive periodic autoregressive model generally used in SDDP. The proposed model is applied on the Senegal River system for the optimal operation of Manantali Reservoir and evaluated against the streamflow process model currently used in the water management literature...|$|E

Following Turi and Plotkin, our definition, suitably restricted, agrees with the notion of a set of $GSOS$-rules, allowing one to construct both an operational model and a canonical, internally fully abstract denotational model.

The present paper focuses on the first phase of this acquisition process, the normalization phase that aims at transforming NL statements into controlled language (CL), rather than on their formalization into an <b>operational</b> <b>rule</b> base. We show that turning a NL text into a set of self-sufficient and independent CL rules is itself a complex task that involves some lexical and syntactic normalizations but also the restoration of contextual information and of implicit semantic entities to get a set of self-sufficient and unambiguous rule statements.

Whereas previous studies have examined the rule's performance in the context of United States experience since World War II, the present paper is concerned with the period 1923 - 1941. Counterfactual historical simulations are conducted with the rule and a small model of nominal GNP determination, estimated with U. S. quarterly data for 1922 - 1941. Residuals from the estimated relationships serve as estimates of the behavioral shocks that occurred and accordingly are fed into the simulation process quarter by quarter. The simulation results indicate that nominal GNP would have been kept reasonably close to a steady 3 percent growth path over 1923 - 1941 if the rule had been in effect, in which case {{it is highly unlikely that}} real output and employment could have collapsed as they did during the 1930 s. ...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{integrating}} {{the understanding of}} the river geomorphic dynamic into planning of reservoir operation rules. The case study is a 112 km long reach of the Po river in Italy, from Piacenza to Boretto. The Isola Serafini (IS) gate serves a large run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plant since 1962. The dam blocks a relevant amount of sediments and is cause, together with intense sand mining, for the river bed incision immediately downstream that has made several navigation and irrigation devices unusable during low flow periods, leading to expensive and recurrent works to restore their functionality. The <b>operational</b> <b>rule</b> of IS gate was modelled using 4 parameters and a number of experiments were simulated adopting alternative operating policies over a 10 -years period. A 1 D hydraulic numerical model with mobile bed has been used to estimate bed degradation trends. The results show that there is space for a meaningful trade-off between the conflicting objectives of hydropower production and reduction of river bed degradation. The analysis provides operative rules able to effectively tackle river bed incision with moderate loss in hydropower production...|$|E

Low-level <b>operational</b> <b>rules</b> are then derived to manipulate concrete graphs. However, TGG rules may become unnecessarily verbose when el-ements {{have to be}} replicated from one graph to the other, and their actual derivation cannot exploit the presence of reoccurring patterns. Moreover they do not take ad-vantage from situations in which a normal creation grammar {{for one of the}} graphs exists, from which TGG <b>operational</b> <b>rules</b> can be derived to build the other graph. We present an approach to generating TGG <b>operational</b> <b>rules</b> from normal ones, reducing the information needed to derive them, through the definition of Triple Patterns, a high-level, compact, declarative, and visual notation for the description of admissible structures in a triple graph. Patterns can be expressed with respect to classes defined in a meta-model, and instantiated with derived classes at the model level, thus exploiting the inheritance hierarchies. The application of the generated rules results into the (synchronized or batch) creation of the structures specified in the patterns. We illustrate these concepts by showing their application to the synchronized incremental construction of visual models and of their semantics...|$|R

EVB produces and supplies energy and utilities to other production plants at the Botlek site. Due to the intertwined value chain and reuse of each other’s residual and waste products, the situation at the Botlek is complicated. This report describes the development of a decision support model that contributes to an improved economic efficiency of AkzoNobel’s EVB plant. The decision support model calculates the optimal production settings that minimize the variable costs and assure that at all times the critical operational conditions are met. By comparing the results of the optimization model with the base case model, it can be concluded that there is a savings potential of more than 6 % of the variable costs of the EVB plant. From the optimized production settings a pattern is distinguished. This pattern is translated into a set of <b>operational</b> <b>rules</b> that {{can be applied to the}} EVB plant to realize the savings potential.
