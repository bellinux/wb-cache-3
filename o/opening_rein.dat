25|$|Aids: To {{ask for a}} {{specific}} lead while in the air, the rider should look in the intended direction of travel, not down. The rider should lead the horse {{in the direction of}} the turn by applying the <b>opening</b> <b>rein</b> aid without pulling backward, while the other hand releases as usual. The outside leg is moved slightly back, and the rider adds slightly more weight to the inside knee. However, the rider should not shift weight so much that he or she becomes unbalanced or has the heels come up.|$|E
50|$|By {{weighting}} {{one seat}} bone or the other, one can encourage bend in that direction. This {{should always be}} used with the inside leg asking for the horse to bend around it, and the outside leg providing impulsion for the bend. The hands also ask the horse to bend, with a slight direct or indirect rein. A more advanced form of this set of aids {{is seen in the}} half-pass, where the outside leg asks the horse to step over, the inside <b>opening</b> <b>rein</b> encourages that movement, and the inside seatbone and leg maintain the bend in the direction of travel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{left hand}} holds the left bradoon rein below the fourth finger (pinkie), {{the left hand}} curb rein between {{the third and fourth}} fingers, and the right hand curb between the second and third fingers. It is held right over the pommel of the saddle. The right hand holds the bradoon as it would {{normally}} hold a snaffle (between the third and fourth fingers), and the hand is held very close to the left hand. This hold has several important consequences: it decreases the action of the curb, it prevents the rider from riding with their hands too wide or performing an overzealous <b>opening</b> <b>rein</b> with their left hand, and it shows when the horse is not properly straight, because the rider can no longer make the rein pressure {{on one side of the}} mouth any stronger than the other, since reins from both sides are held in the left hand. The rider must ride off the seat and legs to bend the horse, and the horse must therefore be properly [...] "through".|$|E
