25|$|There is a {{positive}} relationship between national wealth and good health. The rich and industrialized countries of the world, prominently Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, spend a large proportion of their wealthy budget <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. As, a result, their health care systems are very sophisticated, with many physicians, nurses, and other health care experts servicing the population. Thus, infant mortality is low. On the other hand, a country such as Mexico, which spends disproportionately less of its budget on healthcare, suffers from high mortality rates. This is because the general population is likely to be less healthy. In the U.S., infant mortality rates are especially high in minority groups. For instance, non-Hispanic black women have an infant mortality rate of 13.63 per 1000 live births whereas in non-Hispanic white women it was much lower at a rate of 5.76 per 1000 live births. The average infant mortality rate in the U.S. is 6.8 per 1000 live births.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate, it seems to take the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system." [...] In addition, Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode, [...] "and perhaps see some sponsors end support of the show."
