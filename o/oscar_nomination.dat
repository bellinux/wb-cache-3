5|$|Ran won several {{awards in}} Japan, {{but was not}} quite as honored there {{as many of the}} director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the {{selection}} of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 57th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an <b>Oscar</b> <b>nomination</b> for Best Directing that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Rans costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women.

After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder.
