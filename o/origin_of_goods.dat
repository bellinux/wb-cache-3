50|$|The “most {{important}} part of the manufacturing process” is that part of the process that results in a completely new product. The determining factor here is that the original characteristics of the goods are lost through the manufacturing process, and the possible application of the goods is {{different from that of the}} basic materials of foreign origin used in their manufacture. In addition, the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> is determined by the place where they are produced, not by where the idea for producing these goods was conceived. A product manufactured in Switzerland under a foreign license will still be Swiss in origin, while a product manufactured abroad using Swiss recipes or Swiss methods will still be foreign in origin.|$|E

Traditionally each of these has used all-or-nothing rules of origin. The paper proposes a new method of dealing with all three problems. This method substitutes a valuation based on the value added in different origins for the present methods of valuing goods at the gross price and attributing origin to only one country. The value added method would improve the efficiency of world production and consumption in a number of ways. ...|$|E
