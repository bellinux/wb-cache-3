2500|$|Walter Kaufmann (1905, 1906) was {{probably}} the first who referred to Einstein's work. He compared the theories of Lorentz and Einstein and, although he said Einstein's method is to be preferred, he argued that both theories are observationally equivalent. Therefore, {{he spoke of the}} relativity principle as the [...] "Lorentz-Einsteinian" [...] basic assumption. Shortly afterwards, Max Planck (1906a) was the first who publicly defended the theory and interested his students, Max von Laue and Kurd von Mosengeil, in this formulation. He described Einstein's theory as a [...] "generalization" [...] of Lorentz's theory and, to this [...] "Lorentz-Einstein-Theory", he gave the name [...] "relative theory"; while Alfred Bucherer changed Planck's nomenclature into the now common [...] "theory of relativity". On the other hand, Einstein himself and many others continued to refer simply to the new method as the [...] "relativity principle". And in an important <b>overview</b> <b>article</b> on the relativity principle (1908a), Einstein described SR as a [...] "union of Lorentz's theory and the relativity principle", including the fundamental assumption that Lorentz's local time can be described as real time. (Yet, Poincaré's contributions were rarely mentioned in the first years after 1905.) All of those expressions, (Lorentz-Einstein theory, relativity principle, relativity theory) were used by different physicists alternately in the next years.|$|E

2500|$|The first L. bulgaricus was {{discovered}} {{more than a}} century ago, the result of a study into the unusual longevity of mountain villagers in Bulgaria (thus called L. bulgaricus) by Dr. Stamen Grigorov in 1905. In 1912, the New York Times wrote an <b>overview</b> <b>article</b> about the new discovery and the use of fermented yogurts with L. bulgaricus in Bulgaria titled “Metchnikoff Confirmed in His Theory of Long Life,” highlighting villager baba Vasilka, age 126, as the longest living person in the world. In fact, in these Bulgarian communities there were 3,000 centenarians from a population of 3 million – six times higher than the number of centenarians per capita in the United States today. [...] the author described the discovery as follows: [...] "In Bulgaria, the home of this bacillus, the majority of the natives live to age considerably in excess of what is recognized as the term of life among Western nations, an inquiry has shown that in the Eastern part of Southern Europe, among a population of about 3,000,000, there were more than 3,000 centenarians found performing duties which would not be assigned to a man of 65 years of age elsewhere. It is quite common to find among the peasants who live to such a large extent upon soured milk individuals of 110 and 120 years of age." ...|$|E

50|$|In an <b>overview</b> <b>article</b> on the Greek economy {{written in}} the mid-1930s, the author, an American economist, cited very little data about the Cyclades.

His chapter devoted to industry cited basketry workshops on Santorini and for Syros, activity in basketry and tannery. However, the Cyclades did appear for their mineral resources. The emery of Naxos, mined consistently since prehistory, was exploited chiefly for export. Sifnos, Serifos, Kythnos and Milos provided iron ore. Santorini provided pozzolana (volcanic ash); Milos, sulphur; and Antiparos and Sifnos, zinc {{in the form of}} calamine. Syros remained one of the country’s export-oriented ports.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} Sneeuwvlokken ("Snow flakes", 1888) was published, she had gained a {{reputation}} for a poetry of love and suffering. By this time she had moved to Mechelen. A review in De Gids compared her work favorably to [...] "sweet, homely poetry", which he likened to a sweet little tune on a fiddle, whereas Swarth's [...] "deep, full poetry" [...] was like hearing Beethoven played by a full orchestra. Again, especially her sonnets were praised. An <b>overview</b> <b>article</b> in Vlaamsche School (1889) pointed at the influence of Pol de Mont, who had advised her to forgo reading narrative and epic, and instead focus on lyrical poetry, sonnets. The origin of the sadness in her poetry was located in a [...] "loss of faith and bitter disappointments".|$|E
