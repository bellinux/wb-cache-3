5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of {{the sex industry}} argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In these communities, {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} know <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> and matrifocal ancient societies, {{very little}} {{can be said}} about a society of a species, which is as remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E

5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element {{is the theme of}} loss in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E

25|$|When the {{organisation}} started, empowering women {{to assert their}} right to remain celibate, particularly in marriage, was a prime factor in the controversy that arose in 1930s Sind, as it directly challenged the dominance of men over women in patriarchal India.

25|$|Patriarchal exarch is {{appointed}} in those Eastern Catholic churches whose head is styled as patriarch.

25|$|Globally, younger {{children}} are {{at greater risk}} from physical violence while older children are more likely to suffer from sexual violence. Boys are more at risk from physical violence than girls, while girls may face neglect and sexual violence. Patriarchal attitudes perpetuate women's inferior status and increase violence against women. Many of Ethiopia's different ethnic groups share a culture <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> norms and values. Girls are socialized to be shy and obedient and not to speak in front of adults, particularly in front of men. The focus is on her future role as obedient wife and good mother.|$|E
25|$|On June 29, 2010 the {{government}} of Turkey {{made a decision to}} reject the request of the Armenian community of Turkey to allow co-patriarch elections. The Turkish Government said that they did not find the elections of either patriarch or co-patriarch reasonable and allowed carrying out only the elections <b>of</b> <b>Patriarchal</b> Locum Tenens. Hours later Archbishop Shahan Svajian – the that time Locum Tenens, resigned and the Spiritual council of the Patriarchate elected Archbishop Aram Ateshian a new Patriarchal Locum Tenens. However, according to some experts, the Armenian Community of Turkey was inclined to elect Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian (citizen of Armenia) as their spiritual leader which was disallowed by the Turkish government after unsuccessful negotiations of Armenia-Turkey reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|Issei women's {{lives were}} {{somewhat}} similar, despite differences in context, {{because they were}} structured within interlocking webs <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and {{as a source of}} happiness. The Issei women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late Meiji Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. Substantive evidence of the working lives of Issei women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.|$|E

Changes in gender may be caused by a god or through the use of magic, in order to deceive others or to facilitate a romantic encounter. A change in gender may also occur spontaneously due to changes in a person's spiritual or moral character, either in a single life, or through reincarnation.|$|E

500|$|Cyprian Blamires {{states that}} {{although}} feminists {{were among those}} who opposed the rise of Adolf Hitler, feminism has a complicated relationship with the Nazi movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions <b>of</b> <b>patriarchal</b> society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment. However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism, and after the rise of Nazism in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period {{and to some extent}} during the 1920s. Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position. Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept [...] "their traditional roles".|$|E
