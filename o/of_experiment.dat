5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander <b>of</b> <b>Experiment,</b> had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|The officers' reports also commended Porter, {{stating that}} he had saved Experiment and her convoy by acting on his own {{initiative}} to ignore Maley's defeatism, urging the crew to fight. Other American officials, such as the American consul at Leonge who was aboard the Experiment during the action, disagreed with Porter's accusations and instead lauded Maley for his bravery. Threats of court-martial were made against Maley, but no formal charges regarding the incident were ever brought. On 16 July 1800 he was replaced as commander <b>of</b> <b>Experiment</b> by Charles Stewart. The incident haunted his career until his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose the}} {{framework}} of a Machine Translation (MT) bootstrapping method by using multilingual Wikipedia articles.

For the first type <b>of</b> <b>experiments,</b> we use JENAAD, which is a sentence-aligned corpus built by the conventional sentence alignment method. The second type <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> uses actual English and Japanese Wikipedia articles for sentence alignment. The result of the first type <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> shows that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the conventional sentence alignment method.

5|$|The entire {{flotilla}} of Haitians {{once more}} retired to Gonâve and replaced their wounded crewmembers with fresh ones. Seeing that Daniel and Mary and Washington had drifted {{away from the}} convoy, the Haitians set out to attack them. The two civilian vessels, having drifted {{too far from the}} protection <b>of</b> <b>Experiment</b> guns, were abandoned by their crews and passengers who fled to the American warship. The Haitians boarded and plundered these two vessels, carrying them further away from Experiment. Experiment managed to get close enough to the barges to attack them with her cannon but could not pursue them, as two barges had broken away from the main flotilla and were positioned to take Mary and Sea Flower if Experiment left them. Eventually the remnants of the convoy managed to make it to Léogâne, where they were looked after by the American consul.|$|E
5|$|They meet {{an old man}} who angrily {{tells them}} that there are no monsters and sends them to see his son, a {{geneticist}} named Francis Pollidori (John O'Hurley). Dr. Pollidori shows them his experiments studying the Hox gene using the fruit fly Drosophila. This presentation includes images of a fly with legs growing out of its mouth. He tells the agents that the same kind <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> could, in theory, be performed on humans. Afterward, Mulder tells Scully that he believes that Dr. Pollidori, acting as a modern-day Victor Frankenstein, has created The Great Mutato. Later, Dr. Pollidori's wife Elizabeth (Miriam Smith) is knocked unconscious and is attacked {{in the same manner as}} Shaineh. At the crime scene, Mulder and Scully find a chemical residue from an agricultural agent used to anesthetize animals, which leads them to suspect Dr. Pollidori's father, who is a farmer. Dr. Pollidori comes to his father's house, angrily confronts him, and murders him. Later, Mutato, who lives with Pollidori Sr., finds his dead body and tearfully buries it in a barn.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type <b>of</b> <b>experiment.</b> They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally {{in front of the}} handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E

Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort <b>of</b> <b>experiment.</b> Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E

30|$|The Taguchi {{method is}} a {{statistical}} technique of {{laying out the}} conditions <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> involving multiple factors to optimise the parameters and improve {{the performance of the}} system. The method is popularly known as the factorial design <b>of</b> <b>experiments.</b> A full factorial design will identify all possible combinations for a given set of factors and results in a large number <b>of</b> <b>experiments.</b> To reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>experiments,</b> Taguchi proposed an orthogonal array-based method to study the entire parameter space (matrix <b>of</b> <b>experiments)</b> with a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>experiments.</b> With the help of this matrix, one can get maximum information from a minimum number of trials and also the best level of each parameter can be obtained for an objective function. For the analysis of data, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios are used to calculate the response of the experimental trials. There are three types of analysis of the response results: lower is better, nominal is better, higher is better, and these can be expressed by the following equations (Inc 2015, 2016).|$|R

Design <b>of</b> <b>Experiments</b> determines the pattern of observations to be made with a minimum of experimental efforts. DOE process is implemented to FDM process to optimize the processing time. In this study three process parameters at three levels are selected. Using full factorial design totally 27 experiments are required. Using design <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> and orthogonal array the total number <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> are reduced to 9. Therefore the optimum processing time will be obtained in these 9 experiments. Thus 9 experiments are conducted and the experimental data obtained from the experimental trails are analyzed using S/N ratio and ANOVA analysis...|$|R

25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind <b>of</b> <b>experiment,</b> regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E
25|$|Euclid's axioms: In his {{dissertation}} to Trinity College, Cambridge, Bertrand Russell summarized the changing role of Euclid's geometry {{in the minds}} of philosophers up to that time. It was a conflict between certain knowledge, independent <b>of</b> <b>experiment,</b> and empiricism, requiring experimental input. This issue became clear as it was discovered that the parallel postulate was not necessarily valid and its applicability was an empirical matter, deciding whether the applicable geometry was Euclidean or non-Euclidean.|$|E
