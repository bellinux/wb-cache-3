40|$|In this paper, the {{expressive}} power <b>of</b> disjunctive <b>rules</b> involving default negation is analyzed within a framework based on polynomial, faithful and modular (PFM) translations.

Moreover, there is no PFM translation for removing default negation from the bodies <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> Consequently, disjunctive logic programs with default negation in the bodies <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> are strictly more expressive than those without...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{investigation}} into the combination <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> for text categorization using Dempster’s <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> combination.

Our experimental results show that the performance of the best combination of the multiple sets <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> on the 10 groups of the benchmark data can achieve 80. 47 % classification accuracy, which is 3. 24 % better than that of the best single set <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Starting from {{research}} on relations between attachment {{and the development}} of self-regulation, the present study aimed to investigate research questions on relations among inhibitory control, internalization <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> conduct (i. e., behavior regulation, concern occasioned by others transgressions, confession, reparation after wrongdoing), and attachment security. Attachment security and internalization <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> conduct of German kindergarten children (N = 82) were assessed by maternal reports.

Regression analyses revealed that inhibitory control was positively related to attachment security and to internalization <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> conduct. Mediational analysis using a bootstrapping approach indicated an indirect effect of attachment security on internalization processes via inhibitory control.

40|$|After decades <b>of</b> neglect, the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is much on {{the minds}} of legal {{scholars}} today. In the United States, the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v.

Transition and developing economies have increasingly come to recognize the importance <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in establishing a framework for economic growth and individual liberty. This essay provides an overview of these debates over the concept and consequences <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. Although American scholars have criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v.

5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior <b>of</b> <b>Rule</b> 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps of the Rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of the Rule 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations <b>of</b> <b>Rule</b> 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
