40|$|Robot-discoverers {{and other}} {{intelligent}} systems should {{interact with the}} physical world in complex, yet purposeful and accurate ways. Knowledge representation which is internal to a computer lacks empirical meaning and thus it is insu cient for {{the investigation of the}} external world. We argue that <b>operational</b> <b>definitions</b> are necessary to provide empirical meaning of concepts, but they have been largely ignored by the research on automation of discovery. In this paper we reconstruct the scientific mechanism by which operational de nitions are created and we make several steps towards the implementation. Individual <b>operational</b> <b>definitions</b> can be viewed as algorithms that operate in the real world. They can and they should be improved in the course of interaction with the real world, so that their accuracy is improved. We explain why many <b>operational</b> <b>definitions</b> are needed for each concept and how different <b>operational</b> <b>definitions</b> of the same concept can be empirically and theoretically equivalent.

25|$|An <b>operational</b> <b>definition</b> is the {{application}} of operationalization used in defining {{the terms of a}} process (or set of validation tests) needed to determine the nature of an item or phenomenon (e.g. a variable, term, or object) and its properties such as duration, quantity, extension in space, chemical composition, etc. Since the degree of operationalization can vary itself, it can result in a more or less <b>operational</b> <b>definition.</b> The procedures included in definitions should be repeatable by anyone or at least by peers.|$|E

25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an <b>operational</b> <b>definition,</b> since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove {{that we are talking}} about the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being. They found that extraversion only {{served as a}} predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism. In addition {{to the importance of}} including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an <b>operational</b> <b>definition</b> of well-being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor.|$|E

Conceptual definitions and individual components of the <b>operational</b> <b>definitions</b> were categorized. Results indicated that withdrawal was not well-defined operationally or conceptually; only four studies (33 percent) included conceptual definitions and there was little inter-study agreement.

25|$|In the 20th century, the Newtonian {{concepts}} of absolute {{time and space}} were challenged by relativity. Einstein's principle of equivalence put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant {{by the force of}} gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an <b>operational</b> <b>definition</b> defined by the act of weighing.|$|E
25|$|Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is {{restricted}} to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points {{in each of the}} respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members. The <b>operational</b> <b>definition</b> of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; foodborne disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the farm-to-table continuum.|$|E
500|$|Experimental {{research}} on consciousness presents special difficulties, {{due to the}} lack of a universally accepted <b>operational</b> <b>definition.</b> In the majority of experiments that are specifically about consciousness, the subjects are human, and the criterion used is verbal report: [...] in other words, subjects are asked to describe their experiences, and their descriptions are treated as observations of the contents of consciousness. [...] For example, subjects who stare continuously at a Necker cube usually report that they experience it [...] "flipping" [...] between two 3D configurations, even though the stimulus itself remains the same. [...] The objective is to understand the relationship between the conscious awareness of stimuli (as indicated by verbal report) and the effects the stimuli have on brain activity and behavior. In several paradigms, such as the technique of response priming, the behavior of subjects is clearly influenced by stimuli for which they report no awareness, and suitable experimental manipulations can lead to increasing priming effects despite decreasing prime identification (double dissociation).|$|E
