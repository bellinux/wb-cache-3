5|$|After Marathon, {{probably}} in 489, Miltiades, {{the hero of}} the battle, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted. The Athenian aristocracy, and indeed Greek aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace. Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the Athenian people', but died weeks later {{as a result of his}} wound. In the wake of this prosecution, the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy, which had been part of Cleisthenes's reforms, but remained so far unused. This was 'ostracism'each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery (ostrakon) the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years. This may have been triggered by Miltiades's prosecution, and used by the Athenians to try and stop such power-games among the noble families. Certainly, in the years (487BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the Alcmaeonids, were exiled. The career <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the social}} circumstances, {{politically}} oriented social problem films ridiculed politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars. In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, {{this time to}} get an imbecile, who is accidentally in the running for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E

5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually acted like a rock star instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician.</b> She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E

He took refuge at Pigneau's seminary from September to October before both were forced to flee to the island of Pulo Panjang in the Gulf of Siam. The move was a political step taken by Pigneau to align himself with Nguyễn Ánh, allowing himself a foray into politics.

25|$|Wilson's {{popularity}} was not universal. Sir Sam Fay, {{a railway}} official {{who worked at}} the War Office 1917–19, enjoyed cordial face-to-face relations with Wilson but wrote that he could argue with total conviction that a horse chestnut was the same thing as a chestnut horse, and that an unnamed senior general said he suffered a “sexual disturbance” whenever he came within a mile <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> (Fay recorded that the general had in fact used “vulgar and obscene” language – Walter Reid simply writes that exposure to politicians gave Wilson an erection). Edward Spears – also a senior Anglo-French liaison officer, but junior to Wilson – loathed him and compared him to Quint, the sinister and evil valet in Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
500|$|Nixon's {{speech was}} {{seen or heard}} by about 60 million Americans, {{including}} the largest television audience to that time, and led to an outpouring of public support. [...] A huge majority {{of the millions of}} telegrams and phone calls received by the RNC and other political offices supported Nixon. He was retained on the ticket, which then swept to victory weeks later in November 1952. The Checkers speech was an early example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> using television to appeal directly to the electorate, but has since sometimes been mocked or denigrated. Checkers speech has come more generally to mean any emotional speech by a politician.|$|E

500|$|Seward's reputation, {{controversial}} in life, remained so in death, dividing his contemporaries. Former Navy Secretary Gideon Welles argued {{that not only}} did Seward lack principles, Gideon was unable to understand how Seward had fooled Lincoln into thinking that he did, gaining entry to the Cabinet thereby. Charles Francis Adams, minister in London during Seward's tenure as secretary, deemed him [...] "more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> than a statesman", but Charles Anderson Dana, former Assistant Secretary of War, disagreed, writing that Seward had [...] "the most cultivated and comprehensive intellect in the administration" [...] and [...] "what is very rare in a lawyer, a politician, or a statesman—imagination".|$|E
500|$|Disraeli's early [...] "silver fork" [...] novels Vivian Grey (1826) and The Young Duke (1831) {{featured}} romanticised {{depictions of}} aristocratic life (despite his ignorance of it) with character sketches of well-known public figures lightly disguised. [...] In {{some of his}} early fiction Disraeli also portrayed himself and what he felt to be his Byronic dual nature: the poet and the man of action. His most autobiographical novel was Contarini Fleming (1832), an avowedly serious work that did not sell well. The critic William Kuhn suggests that Disraeli's fiction {{can be read as}} [...] "the memoirs he never wrote", revealing the inner life <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket—particularly with regard to what Kuhn sees as the author's [...] "ambiguous sexuality".|$|E
500|$|Revisionist {{histories}} of the late 20th century have argued {{in favor of a}} more nuanced image of Las Casas, suggesting that he was neither a saint nor a fanatic, but a person with exceptional willpower and a sense of justice, which sometimes led him into arrogance, stubbornness and hypocrisy. Some historians such as [...] argue that he was more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> than a humanitarian, and that his liberation policies were always combined with schemes to make colonial extraction of resources from the natives more efficient. He also argues that Las Casas failed to realize that by seeking to replace indigenous spirituality with Christianity, he was undertaking a religious colonialism that was more intrusive than the physical one. This critique has been rejected by other historians as facile and anachronistic.|$|E

500|$|T. A. Frank of The New Republic {{says that}} in season 1 she is {{completely}} ignored {{by the president and}} dismissed by Congress as she endures repeated indignities {{with a high degree of}} cynicism. According to Frank, Meyer slowly gains some respect and power, but it is not without effort. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker, noted that the premise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> without influence striving for it suited itself well to a comedy and that her frequent cursing should not have been much of an issue given that it was an HBO production. Laura Bennett of The New Republic states that in season 1 Meyer is [...] "a hapless buffoon, fluffing her hair and running in circles", who endures marginalization and irrelevance, but in season 2, which is set during midterm elections, she is [...] "a player in the administration with concrete involvement in foreign policy".|$|E
500|$|Trenchard {{developed}} a negative view of Hankey whom {{he saw as}} being more interested in maintaining unanimity among the service heads than dealing with weaknesses in British defence arrangements. [...] Trenchard began to speak privately against Hankey who, for his part, had no liking for Trenchard. [...] By 1935, Trenchard privately lobbied for Hankey's removal {{on the grounds that}} the nation's security was at stake. Following his departure from the Metropolitan Police, Trenchard was free to speak publicly. [...] In December 1935 Trenchard wrote in The Times that the Committee of Imperial Defence should be placed under the chairmanship <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician.</b> [...] Hankey responded by accusing Trenchard of [...] "trying to stab him in the back." [...] By 1936, the idea of bolstering the Committee of Imperial Defence had become a popular point of debate and Trenchard presented his arguments in the House of Lords. [...] In the end the Government conceded and Sir Thomas Inskip was appointed as the Minister for Coordination of Defence.|$|E
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] to that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, {{who served as a}} budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend that when I could go on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E
