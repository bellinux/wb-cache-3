5|$|A series <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> in {{the summer}} of 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E

The most commonly injured body region is the head (66.8% to 78.0% <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> injuries) followed by the wrist/hand (6.0% to 12.0% <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> injuries), while the most frequent types of injury were laceration (36.7% to 59.4% <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> injuries), fracture (7.4% to 43.3% <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> injuries), and concussion (3.8% to 20.4% <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> injuries).|$|R
40|$|Context: Poorly written {{radiology}} {{reports are}} common among residents {{and are a}} significant challenge for radiology education. While training may improve report quality, a professionally developed reliable and valid scale to measure report quality does not exist. Objectives: To develop a measurement tool for report quality, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale, with rigorous validation through empirical data. Methods: A research team of an experienced psychometrician and six senior radiologists conducted qualitative and quantitative studies. Five items were identified for the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale, each measuring a distinct aspect <b>of</b> <b>report</b> quality. Two dedicated training sessions were designed and implemented to help residents generate high-quality reports. In a blinded fashion, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale was applied to 804 randomly selected reports issued before (n[*]=[*] 403) and after (n[*]=[*] 401) training. Full-scale psychometrical assessments were implemented onto the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale’s item- and scale-scores from the <b>reports.</b> The quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale scores were correlated with report professionalism and attendings’ preference and were compared pre-/post-training. Results: The quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale showed sound psychometrical properties, with high validity and reliability. Reports with higher quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale score were more professional and preferable by attendings. Training improved the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale score, empirically validating the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale further. Conclusion: While succinct and practitioner friendly, the quality <b>of</b> <b>report</b> scale is a reliable and valid measure <b>of</b> radiology <b>report</b> quality and {{has the potential to}} be easily adapted to other fields such as pathology, where similar training would be beneficial...|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E

These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.|$|E
40|$|Descriptive {{epidemiological}} studies documenting the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) and studies that report morbidity, mortality, and economic burden provide essential information for patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers. However, the quality <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> observational studies is often poor, limiting {{the ability to}} evaluate {{the validity of the}} findings. The Standards <b>of</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>of</b> Neurological Disorders (STROND) reporting guideline comprises recommendations and a 15 -item checklist <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> items to aid high-quality <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> incidence and prevalence studies of neurological disorders.

The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved {{nine years of}} research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

Over the next three months, he sent a series <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society {{in stark contrast to}} the corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang.

5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} what he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} scientific literature in terms of pre-clinical studies evaluating the influence of material, surface and design on the integration of an implant by hard and soft tissues. The included publications were analysed with regard to the frequency <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> criteria being derived from the ARRIVE guidelines. This served to trace elements within animal studies, where the quality <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> needs to improve. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature search was performed in Ovid Medline and included English literature from January 1990 to July 2011. A list of 24 criteria derived from the ARRIVE guidelines for animal research was adjusted to implant studies on osseointegration in pristine bone and was applied to all included study manuscripts. Each criteria was graded by " 0 " (not reported) or " 1 " (reported) and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> for each criteria was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 271 studies were included into this review. Generally the quality <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> increased with time. Low frequencies <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> were achieved for criteria like "randomisation of animals", "reasons for the animal model" and "relevance to humans". CONCLUSIONS: The frequency <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> showed high percentages for most criteria. However, the quality <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> in pre-clinical studies needs to improve in areas like the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> statistical information, study setup and the possible translation of the results to humans...|$|R
