40|$|The {{history of}} deglutology {{can be divided}} into three peri-ods: 1. before the 1980 ’s: {{attention}} was focused mainly on the <b>oral</b> <b>phases</b> and childhood; 2. from the eighties to the year 2000 : the fl ourishing pe-riod of deglutology characterised by the almost system-atic introduction of videofl uoroscopy and FEES (use of fi beroptics); almost only adulthood was taken into con-sideration; 3. after the year 2000 : – perfection of theoresis, – infants and children were included, – preparation of guidelines, – organisation of scientifi c societies, – attention focused on particular problems and situations. In the present report, only the latter period (from 2000 on-wards) is discussed. As far as concerns Scientifi c Societies, the following were founded...|$|R
500|$|The Court {{declined}} to accept Malaysia's {{argument that the}} Singapore Colonial Secretary's query {{about the status of}} Pedra Branca in 1953 indicated that the United Kingdom had no conviction that the island was part of its territory. It felt the letter of inquiry showed the Singapore authorities were not clear about events that had occurred over a century earlier and that they were unsure their records were complete, which was understandable in the circumstances. It also disagreed that the Acting State Secretary of Johor, who had stated in his letter of reply that Johor did not claim ownership of the island, had acted without authority. The Johor Agreement was irrelevant – as the Colonial Secretary was a representative of the United Kingdom government which was not a foreign state in relation to Johor at the time, there was no question of the United Kingdom having to consent to Johor issuing the reply. The Federation of Malaya Agreement also did not assist Malaysia because the action of responding to a request for information was not an [...] "exercise" [...] of [...] "executive authority". Further, since Malaysia had not invoked this argument in its negotiations with Singapore and in the ICJ proceedings until late in the <b>oral</b> <b>phase,</b> Singapore was entitled to presume that the Acting State Secretary had acted within his authority. The meaning of the reply was clear – as of 1953, Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, and thus the Singapore authorities had no reason to doubt that the island belonged to the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Irving Bieber and his colleagues, {{writing in}} [...] (1962), note that Bergler's {{view that the}} <b>oral</b> <b>phase</b> is the most determining factor {{in the development of}} homosexuality was also held by the analyst Melanie Klein. Bayer writes that Bieber's work received a negative response from the gay movement that [...] "followed a pattern" [...] set by the earlier critiques of works such as Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? The psychiatrist Daniel Cappon describes Bergler's division of homosexuality into different types as [...] "anecdotal and dynamic", adding that the types are [...] "partly descriptive and partly interpretative", and that Bergler's list is [...] "probably grossly incomplete." [...] Cappon criticized Bergler's approach to classification on the grounds that, [...] "There seems to be no logical scheme for deriving an argument or a design of homosexual configurations from the life history of individuals." [...] The psychoanalyst Charles W. Socarides cited Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? in his work, expressing agreement with Bergler's conclusion that homosexuality has a masochistic basis, as well as with Bergler's views on topics such as female homosexuality. He noted that Bergler was only one of numerous authors to report success in [...] "the psychoanalytic treatment of homosexual patients". Bayer noted Bergler's use of aggressive and intemperate language in Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?, writing that in his comments on homosexuals Bergler had gone beyond the conventional view of homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder.|$|E

30|$|The {{administration}} of progestogens {{for the treatment}} of anovulatory DUB was always a tempting alternative for physicians, in order to restore the natural cycle of endometrial growth and shedding.

50|$|Eating and {{swallowing}} {{are complex}} neuromuscular activities consisting essentially of three phases, an oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase. Each phase {{is controlled by}} a different neurological mechanism. The <b>oral</b> <b>phase,</b> which is entirely voluntary, is mainly controlled by the medial temporal lobes and limbic system of the cerebral cortex with contributions from the motor cortex and other cortical areas. The pharyngeal swallow is started by the <b>oral</b> <b>phase</b> and subsequently is co-ordinated by the swallowing center on the medulla oblongata and pons. The reflex is initiated by touch receptors in the pharynx as a bolus of food is pushed {{to the back of}} the mouth by the tongue, or by stimulation of the palate (palatal reflex).|$|E

Of note, no stabilization on AOM 400 was performed before the AOM 400 maintenance phase. De novo patients entered the study at screening and then proceeded to oral conversion or oral stabilization, depending on their current antipsychotic treatment regimen.|$|R

40|$|By {{following}} {{the path of}} a liquid bolus, from the <b>oral</b> preparatory <b>phase</b> to the esophagus, we show that a few fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics can be used to better understand and assess the importance of bolus viscosity during human swallowing, especially when considering dysfunctional swallowing (dysphagia) and how it can be mitigated. In particular, we highlight the important distinction between different flow regimes (i. e. viscosity controlled versus. inertia controlled flow). We also illustrate the difference between understanding bolus movements controlled by a constant force (or pressure) and those controlled by a constant displacement (or velocity). We limit our discussion to simple, Newtonian liquids where the viscosity does not depend on the speed of flow. Consideration of non-Newtonian effects (such as shear thinning or viscoelasticity), which we believe play an important part in human swallowing, requires a sound grasp of the fundamentals discussed here and warrants further consideration in its own right...|$|R
