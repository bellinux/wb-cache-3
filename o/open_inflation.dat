50|$|The {{economic}} malaise {{affecting the}} Comecon countries - low growth rates and diminishing returns on investment - led many domestic and Western economists to advocate market-based solutions and a sequenced programme of economic reform. It was recognized that micro-economic reform and macro-economic stabilization {{had to be}} combined carefully. Price liberalization without prior remedial measures to eliminate macro-economic imbalances, including an escalating fiscal deficit, a growing money supply due to {{a high level of}} borrowing by state-owned enterprises, and the accumulated savings of households (“monetary overhang”) could result in macro-economic destabilization instead of micro-economic efficiency. Unless entrepreneurs enjoyed secure property rights and farmers owned their farms the process of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” would limit the reallocation of resources and prevent profitable enterprises from expanding to absorb the workers displaced from the liquidation of non-viable enterprises. A hardening of the budget constraints at state-owned enterprises would halt the drain on the state budget from subsidization but would require additional expenditure to counteract the resulting unemployment and drop in aggregate household spending. Monetary overhang meant that price liberalization might convert “repressed inflation” into <b>open</b> <b>inflation,</b> increase the price level still further and generate a price spiral. The transition to a market economy would require state intervention alongside market liberalization, privatization and deregulation. Rationing of essential consumer goods, trade quotas and tariffs and an active monetary policy to ensure that there was sufficient liquidity to maintain commerce might be needed. In addition to tariff protection, measures to control capital flight were also considered necessary in some instances.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} several key features of mortgage markets for optimal policy for <b>open</b> economy <b>inflation</b> targeters. We show {{that the existence of}} fixed mortgage contracts shifts the transmission of monetary policy away from the standard interest rate transmission channel towards direct and indirect exchange rate channels. In addition, contracts that allow for higher loan-to-value ratios and duration allow greater consumption smoothing. To quantify the impact of these effects on <b>open</b> economy <b>inflation</b> targeting, we calibrate our DSGE model to the case of New Zealand and solve for optimal time-consistent policy. New Zealand is the earliest explicit inflation targeter and proves a useful test case since many of the institutional features of mortgage markets are shared with other countries and the strength of the global boom in housing has been at least as strong as other countries. We show that optimal time-consistent policy shifts towards responding more aggressively to inflation and that particular policy reforms would reduce volatility in the economy...|$|R

We show that optimal time-consistent policy is about ten percent less effective under fixed compared to flexible mortgage contracts.

40|$|We {{consider}} a multi-field <b>open</b> <b>inflation</b> model, {{in which one}} of the fields dominates quantum tunneling from a false vacuum while the other field governs slow-roll inflation within the bubble nucleated from false vacuum decay. We call the former the tunneling field and the latter the inflaton field. In the limit of a negligible interaction between the two fields, the false vacuum decay is described by a Coleman-De Luccia instanton. Here we take into account the coupling between the two fields and construct explicitly a multi-field instanton for a simple quartic potential model. We also solve the evolution of the scalar fields within the bubble. We find our model realizes <b>open</b> <b>inflation</b> successfully. This is the first concrete, viable model of <b>open</b> <b>inflation</b> realized with a simple potential. We then study the effect of the multi-field dynamics on the false vacuum decay, specifically on the tunneling rate.

40|$|Cosmologists {{have embraced}} a {{particular}} ad hoc formula for the primordial power spectrum from inflation for universes with Ω_ 0 < 1. However, the so-called "Open Inflation" models, which are attracting {{renewed interest in}} the context of the "string theory landscape" give a different result, and offer a more fully developed picture of the cosmology and fundamental physics basis for inflation with Ω_ 0 < 1. The <b>Open</b> <b>Inflation</b> power spectrum depends not only on Ω_ 0, but on the parameters of the effective fields that drive the universe before the Big Bang (in "another part of the landscape"). This paper considers the search for features in CMB temperature anisotropy data that might reflect a primordial spectrum of the <b>Open</b> <b>Inflation</b> form. We ask whether this search could teach us about high energy physics that described the universe before the onset of the Big Bang, and perhaps even account for the low CMB quadrupole.
