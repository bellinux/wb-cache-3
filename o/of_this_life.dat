5|$|Shortened forms <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> cycle are common, {{for example}} some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety}} of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hubbard {{described}} {{the belief that}} the Christian heaven is “the product of two implants dating back more than 43 trillion years.” He said further that heaven is a “false dream” that leads thetans to a goal that does not exist, and persuades them of the singularity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ten Commandments, and the {{beginnings}} of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism, are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life.</b> Luther's teaching of the Ten Commandments, therefore, has clear eschatological overtones, which, characteristically for Luther, do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common, daily vocations of this perishing world.|$|E
25|$|They {{believe that}} straying {{away from the}} {{community}} implies straying away from Ma'ad – the ultimate objective <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> {{and the meaning of}} the teachings of Islam, which is to return to where all souls comes from and re-unite with Allah. Besides, converting someone to Islam has high spiritual and religious significance as doctrines espouse that making someone a Muslim or Mu'min confers the Sawab (reward of good deeds) equivalent to that of 40 Hajjs and 40 Umrahs (visiting Mecca and the Kaaba during days other than that of Hajj).|$|E

25|$|C.S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity and elsewhere, {{raised the}} {{argument}} from desire. He posed that all natural desires {{have a natural}} object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies {{the existence of such}} things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.|$|E
25|$|Egyptians {{looked at}} the afterlife as a {{continuation}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life,</b> and believed {{that they would be}} able to enjoy many of the same activities. They also held the belief that {{they would be able to}} maintain the same social hierarchy. Egyptians, especially upper class Egyptians, were very preoccupied with making sure their life to come would be as comfortable, if not more comfortable, than their life on earth. They took every precautionary measure to ensure that they would enjoy the same comforts. Excavated tombs were found to contain food, painted murals, statues, jewelry, and various other items.|$|E
25|$|Asceticism is {{indigenous}} to the religions which posit as fundamental the wickedness <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> and the corruption under sin of the flesh. Buddhism, therefore, {{as well as}} Christianity, leads to ascetic practices. Monasteries are institutions of Buddhism no less than of Catholic Christianity. The assumption, found in {{the views of the}} Montanists and others, that concessions made to the natural appetites may be pardoned in those that are of a lower degree of holiness, while the perfectly holy will refuse to yield in the least to carnal needs and desires, is easily detected also in some of the teachings of Gautama Buddha. The ideal of holiness of both the Buddhist and the Christian saint culminates in poverty and chastity; i.e., celibacy. Fasting and other disciplinary methods are resorted to curb the flesh.|$|E

25|$|Having {{given up}} his first job—teaching—after just one day, Watson took a year's course in {{accounting}} and {{business at the}} Miller School of Commerce in Elmira. He left the school in 1891, taking a job at $6 a week as bookkeeper for Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post. One year later he joined a traveling salesman, George Cornwell, peddling organs and pianos around the farms for William Bronson's local hardware store, Watson's first sales job. When Cornwell left, Watson continued alone, earning $10 per week. After two years <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life,</b> he realized he would be earning $70 per week if he were on a commission. His indignation on making this discovery was such that he quit and moved from his familiar surroundings to the relative metropolis of Buffalo.|$|E
25|$|In direct {{contrast}} to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, {{we do not}} set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and {{on the basis of}} their real life process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.|$|E

500|$|Meeker became {{convinced}} that the Oregon Trail was being forgotten, and he determined to bring it publicity {{so it could be}} marked and monuments erected. In 1906–1908, although in his late 70s, he retraced his steps along the Oregon Trail by wagon, seeking to build monuments in communities along the way. His trek reached New York, and in Washington, D.C. he met President Theodore Roosevelt. He traveled the Trail again several times in the final two decades <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life,</b> including by oxcart in 1910–1912 and by airplane in 1924. [...] During another such trip, in 1928, Meeker fell ill but was succored by Henry Ford. [...] On his return to Washington state, Meeker became ill again and died there on December 3, 1928 at age 97. Meeker wrote several books; his work has continued through the activities of such groups as the Oregon-California Trails Association.|$|E

2500|$|As the Chan school grew in China, {{the monastic}} {{discipline}} also became distinct, focusing on practice through {{all aspects of}} life.

2500|$|As {{the first}} {{millennium}} came to an end, the fervor <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>life</b> began to wane, and the cathedral clergy began to live independently of one another. At {{the start of the}} second millennium, there was a revival in interest in the stricter form of clerical life. Several groups of canons were established under various disciplines, all with the Augustinian Rule as their basis. Examples of these were the Congregation of canons in Ravenna, founded by the Blessed Peter de Honestis about 1100, as well as the Norbertines. [...] The instructions contained in Augustine's Rule formed the basis of the Rule that, in accordance with the decree of the Lateran Synod of 1059, was adopted by canons who desired to practice a common apostolic life (Holstenius, Codex regularum, II, Rome, 1661, 120), hence the title of Canons Regular of Saint Augustine.|$|E
