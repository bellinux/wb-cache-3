5|$|Kulintang {{instrument}} has uses {{other than}} public performances. It also {{is used to}} accompany healing ceremonies/rituals (pagipat)/animistic religious ceremonies. Though this practice has died <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Maranao due to its non-Islamic nature, some areas in Mindanao, Sabah and Maluku still practice this ancient tradition.|$|E
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> rural German-speaking farmers who protested {{what they saw as}} a threat to their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990 electoral {{defeat of}} the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened, and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana, or TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August an open revolt broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia.|$|E

5|$|Aside from rubber collection, {{violence}} in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the Force Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused {{a great number of}} casualties.|$|E
5|$|Béla was crowned king {{at least}} {{two months after the}} death of Stephen II, {{implying}} that his accession to the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted Béla's suzerainty around 1136.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 1855, a mutiny broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the artillerymen at Fort San Cristóbal. They were protesting an {{extended}} {{two years of}} military service imposed by the island's Spanish governor, Garcia Cambia. The mutineers pointed their cannons towards San Juan, creating a state of panic among the population. Upon their surrender, the governor had the eight men arrested {{and sentenced to death}} by firing squad.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on {{the defeat of the}} Reds in the 1918 war and {{the fact that most of}} the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Finns.|$|E
5|$|A celebration broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the miners, {{who broke}} into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, {{some of the}} miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks implied by false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E

5|$|After the {{reinforcements}} {{had settled}} in, the Spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards the confederate positions. The first attack came on 26 October when Spanish guns {{opened fire on}} the confederate defences around the Round Tower, causing considerable damage. A French force carried out a simultaneous raid of Gibraltar's harbour, burning the bomb ship. Villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of the San Pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars, which managed to breach it. Among the casualties were the two feuding colonels, Fox and Nugent, who were killed on successive days. At the same time, an epidemic disease broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Gibraltar garrison, reducing their effective numbers to about 1,300 men.|$|E
5|$|Although HTC has {{developed}} several notable Android devices, {{such as the}} Dream—the first publicly released Android device, it failed {{to capitalize on the}} first-mover advantage, and has struggled financially in recent years due to the increasing market share captured by other vendors such as Samsung and Apple. In some markets, HTC released numerous carrier-specific phones and relied heavily on wireless providers to promote its products, a strategy that was unsuccessful in the face of Samsung and Apple’s strong marketing efforts. The company’s flagship phone in 2012, the One X, received critical acclaim from reviewers, but was commercially unsuccessful {{in the wake of the}} Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. In response, the company planned to take bigger risks with their next flagship device to make it stand <b>out</b> <b>among</b> its competitors, and also planned to take a more direct role in promoting its products—doubling its marketing budget for 2013.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{his formal}} education, Hašek stands <b>out</b> <b>among</b> Czech sportsmen. He earned a {{university}} degree after studying {{history and the}} Czech language in the Faculty of Education at the University of Hradec Králové, which qualified {{him to be a}} teacher, and led him to teach high school classes. Hašek also has a brand of sportswear named Dominator Clothing, which was launched shortly after the Nagano Olympics in 1998. It also had two locations in Michigan for a short time. Unfortunately, sales was short, and Dominator brand was forced to end in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands <b>out</b> <b>among</b> others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Following a mutiny in Kiel {{at the end}} of October, a wave of {{revolutions}} broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the German army. In occupied Belgium, {{soldiers of}} the Brussels garrison mutinied against their officers on 10 November 1918. The revolutionaries formed a Soldiers' Council (Soldatenrat) and flew the red flag over the Brussels Kommandantur while many officers, including the Governor-General, left the city for Germany. Fighting in the streets soon broke out between German loyalists and revolutionaries. With the German police no longer keeping order, anarchy broke out in the city which was only restored when Belgian troops arrived. The remaining German forces in Belgium began moving eastwards towards the German border, gradually evacuating more territory. The final German troops left the country on 23 November.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. The group {{returned}} to EMI Studios (now known as Abbey Road Studios) in May to commence recording sessions that lasted through to October. During these sessions, arguments broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the Beatles, and witnesses in the studio saw band members quarrel over creative differences. Another divisive element was the constant presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, whose attendance at the sessions broke with the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick quitting, Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year, leading to the eventual break-up of the Beatles in April 1970.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September, Siboney sailed from New York on {{her fifth}} {{crossing}} {{and arrived at}} Saint-Nazaire nine days later. On 15September, she embarked a number of wounded troops and left Saint-Nazaire the same day, but, due to heavy submarine activity, swung at anchor for several days before her convoy sailed. She arrived on 29September at New York. On her sixth eastward crossing, between 6 and 15October, an influenza epidemic broke <b>out</b> <b>among</b> the troops, killing a number of soldiers. Sailing from Brest on 16October, the transport returned to New York on 24October.|$|E
5|$|Tapestry {{production}} {{began with}} design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment, {{put together by}} qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed <b>out</b> <b>among</b> many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many of the villages.|$|E
