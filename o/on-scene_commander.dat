The AFRCC also formulates and manages SAR plans, agreements and policies throughout the continental United States. Additionally, it presents a mobile Search Management Course to Civil Air Patrol wings throughout the United States, to produce qualified incident commanders thus improving national SAR capability.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{potential}} {{contributions of the}} United States Air Force to stabilization and reconstruction operations. Specifically, the Air Force's <b>On-Scene</b> <b>Commanders</b> Course and Air Force Mission Support Group Commanders are assessed as potential Air Force assets that could be employed in stabilization and reconstruction operations. This research will determine the course's ability to satisfy key needs identified in the post-conflict literature and if the course would be useful for other U. S. agencies with responsibilities in post-conflict operations. Finally, this paper asks if Mission Support Group Commanders can provide critical skill-sets valuable in stability operations. This work will assess the applicability of these Air Force leaders' duties for possible use in post-conflict operations by reviewing the Air Force's Objective Wing Structure and duty histories of current and former Mission Support Group Commanders.

After the aborted pickup, Buzze moved approximately a kilometer {{out of the area}} while A-1s continued efforts to suppress the AAA fire. [...] Jollys 36 and 37 arrived on scene and the <b>on-scene</b> <b>commander</b> again authenticated Buzze's identity and new location.

After further suppression runs by the Sandys, Jolly Green 37 made a third attempt and successfully picked up Buzze more than four hours after his shoot-down.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{goal of the}} Management System for Heterogeneous Networks (MSHN) {{is to provide a}} resource management system (RMS) to enable adaptive applications to use multiple sets of shared resources while accounting for dynamically changing priorities and environments. This RMS must be capable of providing each subscriber process with its required Quality of Service (which might include security considerations, deadlines, user priorities, and preferences) in a heterogeneous computing environment in which many processes are competing for shared resources. Applying this RMS technology to C 4 I modeling and simulation applications would enable <b>on-scene</b> <b>Commanders</b> to simulate complex elements of the decision process in order to optimize the use of forces and materiel. The objective of this thesis was to transparently intercept operating system calls made by a robust, C 4 I modeling application, the Extended Air Defense Simulation (EADSIM), in order to weigh the resources required against the confidence level of the outcomes obtained. Specifically, the goal was to determine resource usage required to run the application using both Monte Carlo simulation and deterministic simulation.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to examine {{decision}} making in emergencies by industrial <b>on-scene</b> incident <b>commanders.</b>   The aim {{was to develop a}} better understanding of decision making strategies used in hazardous, dynamic situations, with ill-defined problems and complex organisational issues.   The project was set in the UK nuclear power generation industry.   The focus was {{on the role of the}} Access Controller (AC), who, as the operational level decision maker in a nuclear emergency response organisation (ERO), is particularly crucial when effective decisions must be made that may affect the potential escalation of the situation. The Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) approach (Zsambok and Klein, 1997), which focuses on the context of the decision making environment, expertise, and the holistic decision making process, provided the theoretical framework for the thesis.   Within this framework, the model of Decision Making Under Stress (DMUS) developed by Stokes, Kemper and Kite (1997) in the aviation domain was tested in this nuclear setting.   The thesis consisted of five studies conducted with participants from various fixed nuclear installations throughout the UK, culminating in the development of a computer-based decision making task. The main findings of the thesis were that the majority of AC decisions are rule-based (80 %). Written procedures did not appear to enhance decision making in emergencies, but prior experience of making a particular emergency decision was found to assist more competent decision making.   Duration of experience in the AC role was not in itself a good indicator of decision making expertise, which was found to be dependent on a corpus of problem solving strategies from normal operational role, along with recognition of critical cues (situation awareness) and recall of a schema or script stored in LTM. The conclusions presented in this thesis, for both the role of AC specifically and a nuclear ERO in general, should go some way towards improved understanding of decision making in complex, hazardous environments.   Moreover, these results may generalise to other industries and organisations where effective decision making during emergency response is essential.

2500|$|As {{the fires}} {{continued}} to burn, occupants {{trapped in the}} upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to 9-1-1 dispatchers. At 9:37am, an occupant on the 105th floor of the South Tower reported that floors beneath him [...] "in the 90-something floor" [...] had collapsed. The New York City Police Department aviation unit also relayed information about the deteriorating condition of the buildings to police commanders. Only 14 people escaped from above the impact zone of the South Tower after it was hit (including Stanley Praimnath, who saw the plane coming at him), and only four from the floors above it. They escaped via Stairwell A, the only stairwell which had been left intact after the impact. Numerous police hotline operators who received calls from individuals inside the South Tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded. Many operators told callers not to descend the tower on their own, {{even though it is}} now believed that Stairwell A was most likely passable at and above the point of impact. At 9:52am, the NYPD aviation unit reported over the radio that [...] "large pieces may be falling from the top of WTC 2. Large pieces are hanging up there". With the warnings, the NYPD issued orders for its officers to evacuate. During the emergency response, there was minimal communication between the NYPD and the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), and overwhelmed 9-1-1 dispatchers did not pass along information to FDNY <b>commanders</b> <b>on-scene.</b> At 9:59am, the South Tower collapsed, 56 minutes after being struck.|$|R
