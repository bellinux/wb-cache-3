Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal {{is not only to}} bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings to Eminem and Akon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.|$|E

[...] This strip was later retitled Birdseye Center, and became the longest-running strip in English Canadian history.

500|$|Consequently, {{there was}} a demand for bootleg {{recordings}} of the band. The most notorious of these was an LP entitled H Bomb, recorded at Aachen on 11 July 1970, {{which led to a}} subsequent court case when Virgin Records' Richard Branson was prosecuted for selling it. An article in Melody Maker that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that H Bomb was the best selling one at that time. This success, along with albums from other artists such as the Who's Live at Leeds and the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out convinced the band that an official live album would be commercially successful. [...] At the time, Glover told Sounds magazine that [...] "there are so many bootlegs of us going around, if we put <b>out</b> <b>our</b> own live set, it should kill their market." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards. Debra Messing (Grace) [...] "gasped loudly" [...] when {{it was revealed that}} the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would be up in a booth instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, [...] "It starts <b>out</b> <b>our</b> final season in a real special way." [...] Eric McCormack (Will) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened; [...] "It keeps it interesting for us. It stirs it up. It gives us a new way to do it." ...|$|E

Citing Mandela's speech in which he said, [...] "Let us use the universal language of music, to sing <b>out</b> <b>our</b> message around the world", Lennox wanted [...] "Sing" [...] to be an anthem and symbol of unity and empowerment, to help spread awareness in the world. [...] "Because the incidence of HIV AIDS {{is on the rise}} for women, especially in the pandemic across the whole of the African continent, I thought perhaps I could be of benefit by writing a song and empowering those women who do not have an international voice," [...] the singer clarified.|$|E

500|$|... "Lighters" [...] {{is mainly}} an {{alternative}} hip hop track. [...] It {{has also been}} described as a blend of rap/hip-hop and pop, further incorporating parts of a synth ballad. The record differs from the hardcore hip hop style used in other songs by Bad Meets Evil in the EP, as it takes influences from synthpop ballad and soul music, mainly on the track's chorus. The song opens with piano chords while Mars sings with his [...] "warm" [...] and [...] "pleasing" [...] vocals in a tenor tone on top of a pop and soul chorus, [...] "This one's for you and me living <b>out</b> <b>our</b> dreams". The singer finishes his verse saying, [...] "All I want to see is a sky full of lighters".

500|$|Texas {{was again}} {{considered}} a buffer province, this time between New Spain and the United States. In 1804, Spain planned to send thousands of colonists {{to increase the}} number of residents in Texas (then at 4,000Hispanic inhabitants). The plan was cancelled as the government did not have the money to relocate the settlers. The responsibility for defending Texas now rested with Nemesio Salcedo, who held the newly reopened position of Commandant General of the Internal Provinces. Salcedo promoted immigration to Texas, and a new town, Trinidad de Salcedo, was founded where the Trinity River intersected the road from San Antonio to Nacogdoches. For a brief time, Salcedo also allowed former Spanish subjects from Louisiana to come to Texas. A few Americans who had become naturalized Spaniards settled in Texas during that time. Salcedo warned, however, that [...] "'the foreigners are not and will not be anything but crows to pick <b>out</b> <b>our</b> eyes.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning <b>out</b> <b>our</b> records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E

The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs.
