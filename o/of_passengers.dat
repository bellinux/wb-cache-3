5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> away from the trains. The problem {{was not limited to}} the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface MDR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to a degree and the reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> {{decreased}} from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers switching from SIRT to city-operated buses {{due to a}} bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. Thirty percent of the company's personnel were laid off. On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one boatload <b>of</b> <b>passengers.</b> On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Study on search {{algorithm}} <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> {{travel route}} in railway transport network {{is of great}} importance in evaluation on railway operation benefit. Based on features of large-scale network and railway passenger transportation organization, the paper firstly innovatively puts forward the generation method of alternative route set in multiple constraint conditions. K short routes is proposed based on layering network to generate the alternative route set <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> flow and hybrid genetic algorithm to generate the alternative route set <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> flow in format of origin-destination matrix in order to overcome the shortage of traditional Dijkstra algorithm. Then reasonable routes <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> flow are selected from the alternative route set. Finally, the algorithm by MATLAB programming can search reasonable route set <b>of</b> 589 <b>passenger</b> flows within 2 minutes in the railway network constituted by 521 stations which verifies the convergence of the algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the current situation <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> transport competition among modes, the progress of increasing the competitive capacity of Chinese Railways (CR), mainly by raising the speed <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> trains, and possible future developments. The first part describes the past and current situation <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> transport in China, from the market in which the supply, dominated by rail, did not satisfied the demand to the market in which the supply which is becoming a little bit over the demand, due to the economic reform and open door policy adopted by Chinese Government. The situation <b>of</b> the <b>passenger</b> transport competition between different modes in different market segment in terms of tariff and service level (speed, frequency and comfortable) and change of market share, are then described. In the following section the key efforts that CR adopted to increase its competitive capacity in the passenger transport – upgrading the existing line and improving the rolling stocks to raise the running speed <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> trains, running diversified passenger trains, increasing the frequency <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> train, opening some passenger service market to private or non railway firm and so on – and its effects are then described. Finally, the possible future development <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> transport in CR, in the fields of competition, ownership and organization reform, and price deregulation, are considered...|$|R
