5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation <b>of</b> <b>opposing</b> continental shelves.|$|E

5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine, {{the navy}} of the German Empire, built {{a series of}} battlecruisers {{in the first half}} of the 20th century.

It marked the first time that the two managers <b>of</b> <b>opposing</b> sides were born outside the British Isles, and it was anticipated the final would receive a large overseas audience {{because of the}} inclusion of several international players.

5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number <b>of</b> <b>opposing</b> naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|At party {{meetings}} in late 1919 and early 1920, hecklers and protesters tried to disrupt Adolf Hitler's speeches, and fought with party members.

The basis for the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) had been formed. Heiden became an early member of the Nazi Party and the SA.

5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King.

No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members <b>of</b> <b>opposing</b> alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E
