5|$|Momoko is a {{childhood}} friend and classmate {{in junior high school}} of Chizuru; she is nicknamed Momo. She constantly hangs around Chizuru and is visibly annoyed when Chizuru socializes with others, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> someone simply sits too close to her. Momoko inevitably starts fighting Saori, who does not particularly respect Chizuru, when they talk.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel {{if he or she is}} not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.|$|E

25|$|In 1899 Lever bought Rockhaven (Castle or Manor) in Horwich. It {{was built}} in 1820 by Mr Richard Brownlow, a lawyer, who later became a recluse. It was {{acquired}} by Lever after Brownlow's death, {{although it is not}} clear when, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if,</b> he lived there on a regular basis. It was finally demolished in 1942.|$|E

25|$|The {{army had}} iron discipline, with the {{officers}} vigorously checking if everything was ready before a battle. For a horse that was undernourished or not properly taken care of, the punishment was death.

25|$|The Great Red Spot {{may have}} existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied {{only after a}} {{prominent}} apparition in 1879. A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.|$|E
25|$|On {{either side}} of the central edifice are located {{dwelling}} rooms, some of which have collapsed, leaving only their foundations visible. Consequently, for full functioning of madrasah only of classroom and some utility rooms is lacking. However, it was common practice that so-called madrasahs had no lecture rooms <b>or,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> they had, no lectures had been given in them. These madrasahs were employed as student hospices.|$|E

25|$|A private message, or PM for short, is {{a message}} sent in private from a member {{to one or more}} other members. The ability to send {{so-called}} blind carbon copies is sometimes available.

25|$|Every well-ordered set {{is uniquely}} order {{isomorphic}} to a unique ordinal number, called the order type of the well-ordered set. The well-ordering theorem, which {{is equivalent to}} the axiom of choice, states that every set can be well ordered. If a set is well ordered (<b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it merely admits a well-founded relation), the proof technique of transfinite induction can be used to prove that a given statement is true for all elements of the set.|$|E
25|$|Square Dancing in the UK {{has seen}} {{diminishing}} numbers of dancers since the 1990s as the activity {{has failed to}} attract sufficient numbers of younger dancers. There {{is a great deal}} of debate as to how to arrest this decline, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the decline should be addressed and accepted as inevitable. British dancers tend to be older people - this is in contrast to countries such as Denmark and Germany where there are flourishing numbers of teenage, student, and family dancers.|$|E

25|$|If {{the entries}} {{of the matrix}} A are all real numbers, then the {{coefficients}} of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have non-zero imaginary parts. The entries of the corresponding eigenvectors therefore may also have non-zero imaginary parts. Similarly, the eigenvalues may be irrational numbers even if all the entries of A are rational numbers <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> they are all integers. However, if the entries of A are all algebraic numbers, which include the rationals, the eigenvalues are complex algebraic numbers.|$|E
25|$|These {{arguments}} (and {{the robot}} or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology {{that would help}} create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test <b>or</b> (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> it did) {{it would not have}} conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of a year, special “season” event cards are {{randomly}} chosen from a deck. All players learn the modifiers these cards may have on the game. These four cards are then shuffled and placed face down on the season track. The first three seasons, a card is revealed and its modifiers applied to the game. During the last season (Winter), the modifiers are ignored, but a number on the card reveals the extent of grain shortage for that year. This element allows players a certain level of planning, but an uncertainty of when (<b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if)</b> the season event will happen.|$|E

25|$|The church holds Mass on Sunday {{mornings and}} weekday afternoons Tuesdays through Fridays.

Catholics seeking absolution can do so a half hour before Mass, by appointment, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the priest {{is available at the}} rectory. At Christmas the church holds a concert where carols are sung in the local First Nations language of Gwich'in and the Inuvialuktun dialect of Inuktitut, the Inuit language, as well as English. In recent years a choir made up of Filipino immigrants to the area has joined in, singing in Tagalog.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Joplin {{created an}} opera company of 30 people and {{produced}} his first opera A Guest of Honor {{for a national}} tour. It is not certain how many productions were staged, <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> this was an all-black show or a racially mixed production. During the tour, either in Springfield, Illinois, or Pittsburg, Kansas, someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts. Joplin could not meet the company's payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. It is believed that the score for A Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company's boarding house bill.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the signal}} boxes on the line bear {{original}} cast iron GWR name plates, with the sole exception being at Bridgnorth which has a replica. The SVR Kidderminster's name plate was recovered from another signal box that formerly stood on the up end of the down platform at Kidderminster station (Network Rail). The lever frame from the same signal box was reused at Arley, which has an LNWR signal box, originally from Yorton after the original was demolished. The replica name plate at Bridgnorth is made of fibre glass, {{although it is not}} known if it was moulded from the original <b>or</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the original still exists.|$|E
