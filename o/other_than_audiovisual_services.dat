The paper specifically examines motion pictures and broadcasting, and discusses what drives or hinders the sector's trade potential. Korean motion pictures have benefited greatly from the elimination of government censorship, substantial investment capital, especially from the 1990 s, and frequent invitations from prestigious international movie festivals. The trade potential of Korean <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> depends on whether Korean <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> providers create high quality content that can be shared locally and/or universally. As recently proven in Korea's film industry, Korean content does have trade potential. The most important prerequisite for high quality content is the generation of creative ideas, which would be hindered by strong government censorship and controls.

Among these <b>services,</b> object-based <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> are gaining importance. In 2014, we established the Software Defined Media (SDM) consortium to target new research areas and markets involving object-based digital media and Internet-by-design audiovisual environments. In this paper, we introduce the SDM architecture that virtualizes networked <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> {{along with the}} development of smart buildings and smart cities using Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart building facilities. Moreover, we design the SDM architecture as a layered architecture to promote the development of innovative applications on the basis of rapid advancements in software-defined networking (SDN). Then, we implement a prototype system based on the architecture, present the system at an exhibition, and provide it as an SDM API to application developers at hackathons. Various types of applications are developed using the API at these events. An evaluation of SDM API access shows that the prototype SDM platform effectively provides 3 D audio reproducibility and interactiveness for SDM applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{global market}} is a {{challenge}} which requires a certain attitude from its economic agents, a proactive behavior meant to ensure advantageous positions in certain domains of activity. In the audiovisual domain, major enterprises have a precise and competitive strategy. Marketing strategies represent “the path chosen by the enterprise {{in order to achieve}} certain goals” which are of two types: market strategies and mix strategies. Market strategies typical of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> have the following criteria for classification: the relation between the demand and the supply, the type of relation with the environment, the competitive relations, the attitude towards viewers. Regarding the <b>services</b> in the <b>audiovisual</b> domain, we’ll take into account, on the one hand, the classical components of mix marketing, namely the product, the price, the investment and the promotion, and, on the other hand, concepts from modern theories such as the personnel (and especially celebrities and the anchor of the respective TV station), the viewer and the relation with the audience. The success of a company of services depends on the quality of its staff; in the case of companies in the audiovisual domain this aspect is even more conspicuous. The quality of the staff’s activity determines the quality of the <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services.</b> <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services,</b> market share, viewers...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{emphasis}} on free trade in global media governance, which could rock the foundations of media regulation in western democracies. While the US government pushes for the further liberalization of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> {{under the umbrella of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), other countries are less enthusiastic. They see the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a threat to their media culture. This article discusses the implications of the GATS for societal regulation of the media and the role of UNESCO's new Convention on Cultural Diversity (CCD). The conclusion is that the liberalization of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>services</b> will prevent several media regulation measures: quota regulations, support programmes for the audiovisual industry and the funding of public service broadcasting are all potentially at risk. Additionally, UNESCO's efforts to promote and protect cultural diversity appear unlikely to stop this development...|$|R
