40|$|AbstractKnowledge {{of spatial}} {{distribution}} for the stopover habitats of migratory raptors is a prerequisite to understanding their stopover ecology and managing their habitats. East Belitung is the important stopover habitat of migratory raptors, <b>Oriental</b> <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> (OHBs Pernisptilorhynchus) based on satellite-tracking data taken in 2006 - 2009. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to analyze stopover habitats distribution of OHBs and their characteristics in East Belitung. Distribution and characteristics of OHBs stopover habitats in East Belitung could be determined by using geographic information systems (GIS) and satellite-tracking data. Logistic regression analysis wasused for analysing several environmental variables (i. e. slope, elevation, and distance to the several nearest land cover) for characterizing the landscape characteristics of OHBsâ€™ stopover habitats. Results showed that the distribution of stopover habitats covered 2, 453. 14 km 2 (94. 93 %) of East Belitung area. Habitat selection at stopover sites was highly influenced by availability of food. Identification of these landscape characteristics provide baseline information for ecological-based development of East Belitung and managing stopover habitats...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} the water-crossing behavior of Western Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus), mostly adults, and European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> (Pernis apivorus), mostly juveniles, {{in relation to}} wind conditions, time of the day, flocking and age classes, at a watchsite in central Italy during the autumn migration en route to Africa. Although European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> are less suited than Western Marsh Harriers to undertake long sea crossings, they were more in-clined to leave the coast when migrating in flocks. Few birds of both species chose to fly along the coast. Western Marsh Harriers, such as European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> migrating alone, under-took the water crossing rather than stopping migration (birds roosting at the site or flying back inland) during the absence of wind and vice versa during head winds. Conversely, European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> migrating in flocks were not affected in their decision (crossing or stopping migration) by wind direction. Both species undertook the water crossing rather than stopping migration during mornings and vice versa during afternoons. Finally, in both species, adults and juveniles showed the same behavior {{in front of a}} water barrier. This result was expected {{in the case of the}} Western Marsh Harrier but not from the European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard</b> since, in this spe-cies, the water-crossing tendency is age dependent with adults avoiding sea crossings.

40|$|Birds of prey {{are one of}} {{environmental}} changes indicators because of their position as top predator. Many of them are migratory species that migrate from northern hemisphere to southern hemisphere, and use Rupat Island (in Riau Province) as stopover habitat. One of them is <b>Oriental</b> <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard</b> (Pernis ptilorhynchus) whose s atellite tracking information (from 200 6 - 2009) are available. This study aimed at identifying distribution characteristics of stopover habitats of Oriental Honey-buzzard in Rupat Island based on satellite tracking data using geographic information system (GIS). Several environmental variables (i. e. slope, elevation, land cover) were processed into distance to the nearest map and analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The result showed that distribution of stopover habitats covered 1 276. 67 km 2 (8 7 %) of totally Rupat Island (1 461. 95 k m 2). This distribution was mostly influenced by food availability and thermal wind. Identification of these habitat characteristics provides a baseline data for managing their stopover habitats and ecologically-based development of Rupat Island.

40|$|The {{importance}} of olfaction for various avian behaviors {{has become increasingly}} evident. So far, the use of olfaction for food detection among raptors has only been demonstrated for Cathartes vultures. The <b>Oriental</b> <b>honey</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Pernis orientalis) is a resident and migrant in Taiwan and regularly forages in apiaries. One of its foods in apiaries is yellow pollen dough, a softball-sized mixture of pollen, soybeans, and sugar that beekeepers provide as a supplementary food for bees. Given that pollen dough is not similar to any naturally occurring food, we hypothesized that buzzards identify the dough's nutritious contents using olfaction, perhaps in combination with vision. Using a series of choice experiments in which individuals could choose between two doughs, we showed that (1) buzzards almost unerringly chose pollen-containing over pollen lacking doughs when otherwise the doughs were identical in size, shape, and yellow color; (2) buzzards always preferred yellow over black or green doughs if both doughs contained pollen; (3) buzzards still preferred pollen-containing over pollen-lacking doughs when both doughs were black, but at a lower rate than in (1). We statistically excluded the possible influences of the doughs' relative brightness or of repeat visits by the same individuals. Our experiments thus suggest {{the use of a}} 'multi-modal foraging strategy' among buzzards whereby olfaction and vision are likely to be both used in identifying food at close distances. We also estimated the olfactory receptor gene repertoire size in the buzzard's genome which is almost five times as large as that of three other raptor species. Therefore, olfaction is likely of far greater ecological importance to this species than to other raptor species. We suggest that olfaction should be considered in the design of behavioral and genetic studies to better understand the use of multiple senses in avian behaviors...|$|E
