The antiinflammatory activity of DM-COOK is comparable with that caused by 5 mg/kg indomethacin and 200 mg/kg phenylbutazone. However, DM-COOK, unlike indomethacin, causes an inhibition of leukocyte migration into the peritoneal cavity induced by casein treatment, thus indicating a different mechanism of action.

Similarly to DM-COOK, MM-COOK reduces metastasis formation and significantly prolongs the survival of mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma when given at a daily dose corresponding to one-half that of DM-COOK. Unlike DM-COOK, MM-COOK exhibits significant cytotoxicity to metastatic foci and pronounced inhibition of primary tumor development. MM-COOK also causes cytotoxic effects on TLX 5 lymphoma cell growing in the peritoneal cavity, even when used at low doses. The antimetastatic effects observed in mice bearing MCa mammary carcinoma are unrelated to the inhibition of primary tumor growth and are more likely due to the selection of clones endowed with lower metastatic ability. It appears that MM-COOK exhibits the same anti-neoplastic activity as DM-COOK, but the former does so at a lower daily dose and produces interesting cytotoxic effects other than those reflecting its antimetastatic properties. It thus seems to be a valid alternative to DM-COOK, in view of the possible introduction of newer aryltriazenes into clinical use...|$|R

40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} to optimize propagation {{of the southern}} China native Camptotheca acuminata Decaisne, source of the medicinal compound camptothecin that {{is used in the}} treatment of multiple forms of cancer and other diseases. The study focused on cutting propagation, micropropagation, and seed storage. Softwood cuttings of C. acuminata rooted readily in intermittent mist (4 sec on every 6 min.) in coarse vermiculite when treated with K-IBA (indolebutyric <b>acid,</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>salt)</b> quick dips ranging from 4. 14 mM to 37. 3 mM, with a 29. 0 mM quick dip (5 sec.) promoting 82 % rooting with little foliar damage. Actively growing shoot tip explants were tissue cultured on media containing Murashige and Skoog, Gamborg's B 5, and Woody Plant Medium (WPM) salts in factorial combinations with BA (benzyladenine). WPM containing 4. 44 ?M BA promoted excellent shoot proliferation; microcuttings were rooted, acclimated, and grown in the greenhouse. Seeds stored in polyethylene bags in a refrigerator (4 ?C) or freezer (- 20 ?C) maintained good germination (81 % and 80 %, respectively) while seeds stored at room temperature (25 ?C) in polyethylene bags lost germination ability quickly (58 %) after one year of storage. C. acuminata is readily adaptable to modern nursery techniques for either vegetative or seed propagation...|$|R
