5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E

5000|$|Stompboxes {{are small}} plastic or metal chassis which usually {{lie on the}} floor or in a pedalboard to be {{operated}} by the user's feet. Pedals are often rectangle-shaped, but there are a range of other shapes (e.g., the circle-shaped Fuzz Face). Typical simple stompboxes have a single footswitch, one to three potentiometers ("pots" [...] or [...] "knobs") for controlling <b>the</b> <b>effect,</b> and a single LED that indicates if <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> is on. A typical distortion or overdrive pedal's three potentiometers, for example, control the level or intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distortion <b>effect,</b> <b>the</b> tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effected</b> signal and <b>the</b> volume (level) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effected</b> signal. Depending on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> pedal, <b>the</b> potentiometers may control different parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect.</b> For a chorus <b>effect,</b> for example, <b>the</b> knobs may control the depth and speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect.</b> Complex stompboxes may have multiple footswitches, many knobs, additional switches or buttons that are operated with the fingers, and an alphanumeric LED display that indicates <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> with short acronyms (e.g., DIST for [...] "distortion"). Some pedals have two knobs stacked on top of each other, enabling the unit to provide two knobs per single knob space.|$|R

5|$|In the {{ten years}} after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al. The Spanish were {{attracted}} to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches from the mountains but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.|$|E
