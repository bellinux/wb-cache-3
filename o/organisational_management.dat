The study comprises four objectives as follows: The first objective of this study was to conduct an extensive literature review regarding the nature of the <b>organisational</b> change <b>management.</b> This entails the process through which the researcher consulted different sources such as books, journal articles, policies and programmes and others in order to conceptualize the issue of <b>organisational</b> change <b>management</b> in a detailed manner. <b>Organisational</b> change <b>management</b> is about an organised and systematic utilization of knowledge, skills, attitudes and other relevant resources for the improvement of the organisational business. <b>Organisational</b> change <b>management</b> is basically intended to enable organisations to adapt to their respective environments, failure of which can lead to their total loss of employees, competition, production and the clientele. <b>Organisational</b> change <b>management</b> has numerous features, namely; it tends to involve contradictions, it is continuous, it is interpreted through the perceptions and interactions of people and it is facilitated by a collaborative inquiry and team-work. <b>Organisational</b> change <b>management</b> is a process that must be treated like any other programme within organisations and as such, it is a responsibility of the human resource management of organisations. It is a programme that is mainly directed at improving the quality of productivity and service delivery. In this regard, <b>organisational</b> change <b>management</b> must be planned, implemented and evaluated within the parameters of the factors that influence change within organisations such as the following: the ever-demanding customers, globalization, new technology, innovation and people...|$|R

This study provides an exploratory approach to understanding the nature of <b>Organisational</b> Change <b>Management</b> in South Africa, by exploring the following key concepts: (1) An understanding of the nature of <b>Organisational</b> Change <b>Management</b> in South Africa (2) The Critical Success Factors needed for <b>Organisational</b> Change <b>Management</b> to succeed in South Africa (3) The provision of a practical <b>Organisational</b> Change <b>Management</b> Framework and Scorecard for the measurement of <b>Organisational</b> Change <b>Management</b> processes and initiatives (4) Recommendations towards a <b>Organisational</b> Change <b>Management</b> Scorecard The study which is largely qualitative in nature makes use of a multiple case study design methodology for the collection of empirical evidence as well as quantitative research data from a survey questionnaire to support the underlying constructs and research questions posed within the study. The use of data and methodological triangulation, namely research interviews, survey data, company and archival documentation as well as focus group discussion points has provided the research study with the necessary validity and reliability to support research results, findings and recommendations. This information should be utilized by Change Practitioners practicing organisational change within a rapidly transforming environment, where Mergers and Acquisitions are major force for change as it would help to provide the necessary change framework and change scorecard for the management and measurement of organisational change interventions. This study also highlights the Critical Success Factors for change by focusing on the Emotional side (Low impact) and Change Imperatives / Prerequisites (High impact) for the <b>management</b> of <b>organisational</b> change. In addition, the study also provides a first view of some change performance measures in the form of a Change Scorecard, which can be used to assess the overall impact of the current change intervention being implemented.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades in Australia and other {{developed}} nations, public sector management philosophies and how the public sector is organised have changed dramatically. At the same time, there have been many demands, and several attempts, to preserve and promote ethical behaviour within the public sector - though few go much beyond the publication of a Code. Both developments require an understanding of how public organisations operate in this new environment. <b>Organisational</b> and <b>management</b> theory are seen as providing important potential insights into the opportunities and pitfalls for building ethics into the practices, culture, and norms of public organisations. This book brings together the experience and research of a range of 'reflective practitioners' and 'engaged academics' in public sector <b>management,</b> <b>organisational</b> theory, <b>management</b> theory, public sector ethics and law. It addresses what management and organisation theory might suggest about the nature of public organisations and the institutionalisation of ethics...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{universities}} worldwide have created new courses and degrees or modified existing ones, {{as a response}} to the increasing interest by companies to hire sustainability literate graduates. However, many of such courses have been developed with a focus on ‘hard’ technocentric or managerial issues. The examples that have been published in academic journal have tended to be descriptive, and in only a limited number of cases have they been based on theories of teaching and learning. This paper presents the process of designing and delivering a new course on <b>organisational</b> change <b>management</b> for sustainability for the BA Environment and Business degree at the University of Leeds. The course was developed based on holism and a constructivist position to help deal with the complexities of sustainability and <b>organisational</b> change <b>management.</b> The course objective was to educate students as sustainability change agents by dealing with the complexities of sustainability and ‘soft’ issues in <b>organisational</b> change <b>management.</b> The process had three key elements: (1) the learning outcomes; (2) the course delivery; and (3) the course assessment (including feedback). During the process a number of challenges had to be overcome. The paper provides a more complete, systematic, robust, and focused approach to education for sustainable development, specifically on course design and delivery, by using theories of teaching and learning and linking the course aims, delivery, and assessment. The paper integrates education for sustainability development and corporate sustainability into a relatively new discipline, <b>organisational</b> change <b>management</b> for sustainability. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: higher {{education}} institutions are currently going through intensive reorganization processes that also have effect on university <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> structures. This {{is caused by the}} mismatch between traditional linear-functional structures of management and current situation in the market of educa¬tional services and by the inability to respond flexibly to changes in the external environment. The purpose of the article is to develop a conceptual model of the university management organisational structure as well as alternative scenarios for transition to the above model based on the analysis of domestic and foreign approaches pertaining to the development of university management structures formed due to the merging of separate universities, scientific organisations, institutions and colleges. Materials and Methods: the conceptual article is based on the analysis of works by domestic and foreign authors in the field of development of organisational design and management structure of a modern university. To achieve this goal, the authors made a comparative analysis between organizational management structures of domestic federal universities and international universities, reorganized in the process of merging. The scenario approach allowed to determine various versions of the <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> structure model that ensures positive results following the integration of vari ous scientific and educational organisations. Results: the analysis of approaches to designing <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> structures of an educational institution was made, including: <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> structures of federal universities, implemented approaches to development of management structures of leading foreign universities. The goals and tasks of the transition to the new organisational design of the university, the principles and requirements for the formation of an effective organisational structure of management are substantiated. Based on profilisation criteria, the provisional structure of the scientific and educational institutions of the merged university is proposed. The analysis of domestic and international approaches to the development of university management structures allowed to put forward alternative scenarios for the formation of the <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> structure model of a united university for the implementation of priority directions of its development. Discussion and Conclusions: the proposals and recommendations following the results of the research seek to create conditions for effective interaction between the subdivisions of the united university, optimisation of the managerial and organisational functions of the leadership of educational and research institutions. For universities originated after the merging of separate universities, scientific organisations, institutes, colleges, variants of the contour model of the <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> structure are proposed. Those proposals are universal during organisational merging of universities...|$|E
40|$|Objectives This {{literature}} review identifies and categorises, from an <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> perspective, {{barriers to the}} use of HIT or ICT for health. Based on the review, it offers policy interventions. Methods This systematic {{literature review}} was carried out during December 2009 and January 2010. Additional on-going reviews of updates through automated system alerts took place up until this paper was submitted. A total of thirty-one sources were searched including nine software platforms/databases, fifteen specialised websites/targeted databases, Google Scholar, ISI Science Citation Index and five journals hand-searched. Results The study covers seventy-nine articles on organisational barriers to ICT adoption by healthcare professionals. These are categorised under five main headings – (I) Structure of healthcare organisations; (II) Tasks; (III) People policies; (IV) Incentives; and (V) Information and decision processes. A total of ten subcategories are also identified. By adopting an <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> approach, some recommendations to remove <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> barriers are made. Conclusions Despite their apparent promise, health information technologies (HIT) have proved difficult to implement. This systematic review reveals the implementation barriers associated to <b>organisational</b> <b>management</b> and their interrelations. Several important future directions in the field are also suggested: (1) {{there is a need for}} further research providing evidence of HIT cost-effectiveness as well as the development of optimal HIT applications; (2) more information is needed regarding organisational change, incentives, liability issues, end-users HIT competences and skills, structure and work process issues involved in realising the benefits from HIT. Future policy interventions should consider the five dimensions identified when addressing the impact of HIT in healthcare organisational systems, and how the impact of an intervention aimed at a particular dimension would interrelate with others.
