5|$|According to Congressman Jim Himes' website, the {{demolition}} funding was appropriated in 2009 {{and consisted of}} more than $2 million through federal funding. The money was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009, and a Community Development Block Grant. According to the Connecticut Post, the State of Connecticut funded $1.2 million for {{the demolition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> and {{the first phase of}} the project was expected to cost $500,000. The contract for the demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> was given to S Corporation and the first task was to remove the eastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches. In 2010, the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Pequonnock River, Bridgeport, CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> due to its removal.|$|E
5|$|Brunel died in 1859, {{without seeing}} the {{completion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> His {{colleagues in the}} Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds. In 1860, Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished {{to make way for}} a new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station. Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton.|$|E
5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the pedestrianisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

5|$|Defences were {{in place}} at both bridges. On {{the west bank of}} the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an {{anti-tank}} gun. To their north were another three machine-guns and a concrete pillbox. An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> had a pillbox with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. To the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E

40|$|The Birchlog Run and Tumbling Rock Run bridges were {{constructed}} in <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1990 on <b>the</b> Monongahela Na-tional Forest in West Virginia. <b>The</b> <b>bridges</b> are simple span, single-lane, stress-laminated deck superstructures, and each bridge is approximately 30 ft long and 13 ft wide. <b>The</b> <b>bridges</b> are located approximately 1 / 2 mile apart and are nearly identical in design.

In addition, com-prehensive visual inspections were conducted to assess <b>the</b> overall condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> Based on 3 years <b>of</b> field monitoring, <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> are performing well with no structural or serviceability deficiencies...|$|R

5|$|The Commandos were {{involved}} in a number of minor skirmishes as they advanced towards the bridge, however, by 03:00 on 14 July the lead elements reached the north-east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> where Durnford-Slater halted the men to re-organise before launching the assault.
