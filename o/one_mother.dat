There were 284,115 Ontarians who declared French as their home language, which represents only 2.2% of the population.

She published an appeal in her magazine asking children {{to let her know}} if they heard such stories and, after <b>one</b> <b>mother</b> informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E

In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: [...] "I had rather rescue <b>one</b> <b>mother</b> from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried the disease." [...] He added, [...] "I beg to be heard in behalf of the women whose lives are at stake, until some stronger voice shall plead for them."

500|$|The {{belief that}} animals were {{intelligent}} enough {{to learn and}} reason, much like a human, was largely born from Darwin's assertion of the evolutionary link between humans and animals. Beginning in the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, the progression from the cause of animal welfare—due to the budding belief that animals could feel pain and suffering—to that of an animal's mental capacity was readily made in popular nature writing. Therefore, Long {{was not the first}} to write of the learned intelligence of animals. Seton often stressed in his stories the wit of the animals he witnessed, as well as {{the fact that most of}} them had been [...] "taught" [...] survival skills by either their mothers or their pack leaders. Other writers supported the idea of animal education: Ernest Ingersoll wrote of [...] "morning lessons" [...] in hunting for nuts, and respected bird watcher Olive Thorne Miller described several different teaching endeavors, such as a music lesson taught from <b>one</b> <b>mother</b> bird to her chicks. Miller would also suggest, although part in jest, that even some of the flowers were intelligent.|$|E
500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. <b>One</b> <b>mother</b> says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There {{is something wrong with}} us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E
