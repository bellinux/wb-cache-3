5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side,</b> and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side.</b> The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold {{on the left side of}} the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E

5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E

5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side,</b> accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
