5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus {{from the time}} of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, dysentery, enteritis, leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis, leucorrhea, fever, and <b>oliguria</b> (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, cough, hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E
25|$|Rare (<0.1% of patients): neutropenia, {{first degree}} heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, dysphagia, <b>oliguria,</b> rhabdomyolysis, suicidal {{thoughts}} or behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} is guarded in any dog developing symptoms of toxicosis. A negative prognosis {{has been associated}} with <b>oliguria</b> or anuria, weakness, difficulty walking, and severe hypercalcemia (increased blood calcium levels).|$|E
25|$|Acute kidney {{injury is}} {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of clinical history and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine, or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed <b>oliguria</b> (less than 400 mLs of urine per 24 hours).|$|E
25|$|Before the {{advancement}} of modern medicine, acute kidney injury {{was referred to as}} uremic poisoning while uremia was contamination of the blood with urine. Starting around 1847, uremia came to be used for reduced urine output, a condition now called <b>oliguria,</b> which was thought to be caused by the urine's mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (melena) and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (<b>oliguria),</b> and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|Average urine {{production}} in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine {{per person per}} day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L {{per person per day}}, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing {{too much or too little}} urine needs medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), <b>oliguria</b> when < 400 mL are produced, and anuria one of < 100 mL per day.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} are malaise and lethargy. Even earlier {{might be a}} pain in {{a section of the}} gums which interferes with digestion. After 1–3 months, patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production. Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness, easy bruising and petechiae, gum disease, loosening of teeth, poor wound healing, and emotional changes (which may appear before any physical changes). Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögren's syndrome may occur. In the late stages, jaundice, generalized edema, <b>oliguria,</b> neuropathy, fever, convulsions, and eventual death are frequently seen.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, melena, hemoptysis, hematuria and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop <b>oliguria</b> or anuria {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
25|$|STEC-HUS occurs after {{ingestion}} of {{a strain of}} bacteria expressing Shiga toxin(s), usually types of E. coli, that expresses verotoxin (also called Shiga-like toxin). E. coli can produce stx1 and/or stx2 Shiga toxins, the latter being more dangerous and {{a combination of both}} toxins in certain ratios is usually associated with HUS. These Shiga toxins bind GB3 receptors, globotriaosylceramide, which are present in renal tissue more than any other tissue and are also found in central nervous system neurons and other tissue. Children have more GB3 receptors than adults which may be why children are more susceptible to HUS. Cattle, swine, deer, and other mammals do not have GB3 receptors, but can be asymptomatic carriers of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria. Some humans can also be asymptomatic carriers. Once the bacteria colonizes, diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, typically follows. HUS develops about 5–10 days after onset of diarrhea, with decreased urine output (<b>oliguria),</b> blood in the urine (hematuria), kidney failure, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and destruction of red blood cells (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). Hypertension is common. In some cases, there are prominent neurologic changes.|$|E
500|$|Both {{types of}} hepatorenal {{syndrome}} share three major components: altered liver function, abnormalities in circulation, and kidney failure. [...] As these phenomena {{may not necessarily}} produce symptoms until late in their course, individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition {{on the basis of}} altered laboratory tests. [...] Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis, and may have signs and symptoms of the same, which can include jaundice, altered mental status, evidence of decreased nutrition, and the presence of ascites. [...] Specifically, the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of diuretic medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS. [...] <b>Oliguria,</b> which is a decrease in urine volume, may occur as a consequence of kidney failure; however, some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine. [...] As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS, they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition {{on the basis of the}} results of laboratory tests, and the exclusion of other causes.|$|E

2500|$|Emesis (induction of vomiting) is the {{generally}} recommended treatment if a dog has eaten grapes or raisins {{within the past}} two hours. A veterinarian may use an emetic such as [...] apomorphine to cause the dog to vomit. Further treatment may involve the use of activated charcoal to adsorb remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and intravenous fluid therapy in the first 48 hours following ingestion to induce diuresis and help to prevent acute renal failure. Vomiting is treated with antiemetics and the stomach is protected from uremic gastritis (damage to the stomach from increased BUN) with H2 receptor antagonists. BUN, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium levels are closely monitored. Dialysis of the blood (hemodialysis) and peritoneal dialysis {{can be used to}} support the kidneys if anuria develops. <b>Oliguria</b> (decreased urine production) can be treated with dopamine or furosemide to stimulate urine production.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{of kidney}} {{dysfunction}} (<b>oliguria,</b> elevated creatinine levels) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanisms}} causing <b>oliguria</b> can {{be categorized}} globally in three different categories: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oliguria</b> — low urine output, {{although}} excess urine {{output is}} more likely.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oliguria,</b> low urine output, usually due to {{a problem}} with the upper urinary tract ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oliguria,</b> when {{defined as}} less than 1 mL/kg/h, in infants is not {{attributed}} to kidney failure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oliguria</b> (low urine output) due to {{inadequate}} {{blood flow}} to the kidneys if the condition persists.|$|E
50|$|Beyond <b>oliguria</b> is anuria, which {{represents}} {{an absence of}} urine, clinically classified as below 80 or 100 ml/day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oliguria</b> {{is defined}} as a urine output that is less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children, and less than 400 mL or 500 mL per 24h in adults - this equals 17 or 21 mL/hour. For example, in an adult {{weighing}} 70 kg it equals 0.24 or 0.3 mL/hour/kg. Alternatively, however, the value of 0.5 mL/kg/h is commonly used to define <b>oliguria</b> in adults as well.|$|E
5000|$|Rare (<0.1% of patients): neutropenia, {{first degree}} heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, dysphagia, <b>oliguria,</b> rhabdomyolysis, suicidal {{thoughts}} or behavior.|$|E
50|$|Stage 1 {{the patient}} has {{increased}} volume requirements and mild respiratory alkalosis which is accompanied by <b>oliguria,</b> hyperglycemia and increased insulin requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Rare (<0.1% of patients): <b>oliguria,</b> hypokalaemia, paraesthesia, seizures, alopecia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia, other blood dyscrasias, serious {{hepatotoxicity}} including liver failure, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions ...|$|E
50|$|The main {{symptoms}} of a hypercalcaemic crisis are <b>oliguria</b> or anuria, as well as somnolence or coma. After recognition, primary hyperparathyroidism should be proved or excluded.|$|E
50|$|Killip class IV {{describes}} {{individuals in}} cardiogenic shock or hypotension (measured as {{systolic blood pressure}} lower than 90 mmHg), and evidence of peripheral vasoconstriction (<b>oliguria,</b> cyanosis or sweating).|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} is guarded in any dog developing symptoms of toxicosis. A negative prognosis {{has been associated}} with <b>oliguria</b> or anuria, weakness, difficulty walking, and severe hypercalcemia (increased blood calcium levels).|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of {{intoxication}} from overdose include drowsiness, insomnia, stupor, agitation, coma, transient confusion, increased anxiety, ataxia, convulsions, <b>oliguria,</b> anuria, tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, AV block, hypotension, shock, respiratory depression, and, rarely, cardiac arrest.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{patients}} may notice foamy or frothy urine, {{due to a}} lowering of the surface tension by the severe proteinuria. Actual urinary complaints such as haematuria or <b>oliguria</b> are uncommon, though these are seen commonly in nephritic syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|The {{syndrome}} {{was first}} described by Leland S. McKittrick and Frank C. Wheelock. In 1954 they reported {{a case of}} an 84-year-old woman with a large villous papilloma of the rectum, who presented with weakness, syncope and <b>oliguria.</b>|$|E
50|$|People {{who develop}} ischemic {{hepatitis}} may have weakness, fatigue, mental confusion, and low urine production (<b>oliguria).</b> A {{small percentage of}} affected people may develop hepatic coma. Jaundice can occur, but is rare and transient, as is actual loss of function of the liver.|$|E
5000|$|The {{woman should}} have {{intravenous}} fluids to maintain {{blood pressure and}} urine output (<b>Oliguria</b> or hypouresis both names from roots meaning [...] "not enough urine" [...] is the low output of urine). Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be given until the fever is gone.|$|E
50|$|Second phase: In one {{to three}} days after {{ingestion}} (and dependent on dose ingested), patients develop metabolic acidosis, which causes acute kidney failure, <b>oliguria,</b> increasing serum creatinine concentrations, and later anuria. Other symptoms reported and secondary to acidosis and/or renal failure are: hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmia, pancreatitis, hyperkalemia or mild hyponatremia.|$|E
50|$|Acute kidney {{injury is}} {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of clinical history and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine, or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed <b>oliguria</b> (less than 400 mLs of urine per 24 hours).|$|E
50|$|Nephritis {{can produce}} glomerular injury, by {{disturbing}} the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation. This {{can lead to}} reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output (<b>oliguria)</b> and retention of waste products (uremia). As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood {{to appear in the}} urine (hematuria).|$|E
