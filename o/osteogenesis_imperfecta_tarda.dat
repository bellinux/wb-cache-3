40|$|O F {{the group}} of {{diseases}} characterized as generalized 'heritable disorders of connective tissue ' osteogenesis imperfecta (01) is not rare. Ite incidence is Himilar to that of Marfan's syndrome, for whioh a figure of 1 - 5 cases per 100, 000 {{of the population is}} quoted (McKusick, 1966). I t was first described by Ekman in his doctorate thesis at Uppsala in 1788 as 'osteomalacia congenita ' involving three generations. Looser (1906) demonstrated that two clinical varieties of osteogenesis imperfeota could be distinguished. The severe form called osteo-genesis imperfecta congenita (OIC) is evident at birth; the infant exhibits numerous fractures acquired in utero, and is often born dead or survives only a short time. The second variety, <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>tarda</b> (OIT) is better known, its manifestations may be so mild that blue sclerae may be the only evidence of the condition. Fractures may occur; usually they are less frequent after puberty. Deafness is the least constant manifestation. Accumulating experience suggests that, in some cases, OIC may be a recessive disorder, different from OIT which is undoubtedly an autosomal dominant one (McKusick, 1966). The subject has been extensively reviewed by McKusick (1966) and also in two recent monographs (Seedorff, 1949; Caniggia, Stuart, and Guideri, 1958). These authors emphasized the wide spectrum of mesenohymal abnor-malities which can occur in OI; herniae are frequent (Freda, Vosburgh, and Di Liberti, 1961), hypertrophic scars result from trauma and surgery. Schmorl's nodes and codfish vertebrae are common and platybasia with its neurological sequelae has been described (Hurwitz and McSwiney, 1960; Taylor and Chak-ravorty, 1964). Marfan's syndrome may be simulated as kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum are not uncommon. Although brachydactyly and brachystenomelia occur as a rule in OI, arachnodactyly has been reporte...|$|E

Mean standing height was reduced in all groups of patients, to the greatest extent and variability in <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type III/IV and in those with qualitative collagen defects. The mean standing height of patients with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> was lower than that of their unaffected first degree family members. Truncal height of patients with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> was reduced; head size was increased, and this was more pronounced in patients with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type III/IV and qualitative collagen defects than in patients with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type I and quantitative collagen defects. Mean concentrations of IGF-I and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3) were low, but most values were within age specific reference values.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} death in patients with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> excluding infants with the perinatal lethal form (type II). METHODS: Seventy nine patients with known <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> were identified, 37 {{of whom had been}} seen clinically in life. Causes of death were identified from death certificates, postmortem reports, medical records, hospital consultants, relatives, and the Brittle Bone Society's records. RESULTS: Patients with the milder types of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> I and IV, often had a normal lifespan and died of unrelated illnesses such as myocardial infarction and malignancy. In some of these patients and in many patients with the more severe type III disease, it was clear that <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> contributed significantly to death, almost certainly to many of the respiratory deaths and to deaths from cardiac failure due to kyphoscoliosis. <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> also caused six deaths, directly or indirectly, due to basilar invagination of the skull. <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> may have contributed to deaths from intracranial bleeding.

40|$|Abstract Background Mutations in the FKBP 10 gene {{were first}} {{described}} {{in patients with}} <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type III.

40|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> is a {{heritable}} {{disorder of}} bone formation {{resulting in low}} bone mass and a propensity to fracture. It exhibits {{a broad range of}} clinical severity, ranging from multiple fracturing in utero and perinatal death to normal adult stature and a low fracture incidence. The disorder is currently classified into seven types based on differences in clinical presentation and bone architecture. Mutation in one of the type I collagen genes is commonly associated with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> but is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis. Indeed, the newer forms of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (types V, VI and VII) are not associated with type I collagen gene defects. Amongst the type I collagen gene mutations that can occur, missense base substitutions involving glycine codons in the exons encoding the central triple-helix forming domain predominate. Such mutations can occur in all the classical forms of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (types I-IV), but genotype/phenotype correlations are complex and often unpredictable.
