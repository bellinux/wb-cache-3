Barriers to <b>exercise</b> among stages <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> were also examined. Design: Insured employees of Sherman Health Systems that set an exercise goal and did not set an exercise goal were sent questionnaires. Subjects {{were asked to identify}} their stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise,</b> which included five statements <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> behaviors. They were also asked to identify personal barriers to exercise from a list of seventeen barriers. The sample size included 256 subjects, a response rate of 55 %. Results: A chi-square analysis was used to determine stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> between the group that set an exercise goal and the group that did not set an exercise goal. No significant differences were found in stages <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> between the two groups. Overall, the average number <b>of</b> barriers to <b>exercise</b> in both groups was 3. 62 with work obligations as the most frequently cited barrier. The average number of barriers cited for each group decreased as the stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> increased. An ANOVA was performed on both groups combined to determine if those in a higher stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> reported fewer barriers. A significant difference was found between the means <b>of</b> stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> and barriers reported across all groups. The precontemplation and contemplation stages reported a similar number of barriers, the preparation and action groups were similar, but the maintenance group cited fewer barriers than all other groups. An ANOVA was used to determine differences <b>of</b> stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> and barriers on each group separately. In both groups, differences were found among stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> and average number of barriers. Applications: Stages <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> may be better utilized if employees set voluntary goals to increase their level <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> As the stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> increases, barriers seem to decrease showing that barriers appear to hinder employees who are not exercising on a regular basis. Barriers within each stage <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> need to be addressed {{so that they can be}} overcome. Employers and health promoters should use tracking mechanisms, interventions such as time management strategies and motivation strategies, and stage specific messages to help employees increase and maintain exercise participation.

The dependent variable in this study was hypertension, while independent variables were the status <b>of</b> <b>exercise,</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> and duration <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> Data were analyzed by chi-square test.

The crosstabulation with chi-square test showed that there was a significant correlation between status <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> with hypertension incidence (p= 0, 001). Beside that, unsignificant correlations were shown between frequency <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> (p= 0, 068) and duration <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> (p= 0, 710) with hypertension in patients more than 45 years old.

The emergent {{grounded theory}}: The {{process of creating}} perceptions <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> was identified from the data. The ongoing creation <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> was influenced by four predominant categories: perceived benefits, striving for normalcy, exercise influences, and asthma's influence. Because process is an ongoing occurrence, the four predominant categories may influence the creation <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> perceptions simultaneously, or at different times and in various ways dependent upon {{the characteristics of the}} child and their unique situations and experiences (context). Perceived benefits, striving for normalcy, exercise influences, and asthma's influence were identified categories involved with the interactions, actions, and consequences interwoven throughout the creation <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> process.

The process of creating perceptions <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> is a continuous, circular, happening with the consequences leading to the development <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> perceptions.

Moreover, total Hb levels obtained after 50 minutes <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those obtained after 40 minutes <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> (p< 0. 05). However, total Hb levels obtained after 60 minutes <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> were not significantly higher than those obtained after 50 minutes <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> (p= 0. 30). Based on the findings of this study, it was concluded that the decline in SV was caused by increased blood flow in the skin and blood volume in exercising muscles during the first 40 minutes <b>of</b> <b>exercise,</b> and by increased blood volume in exercising muscles after 40 minutes <b>of</b> <b>exercise.</b> However, the rate of decline in SV was not equivalent to the rate of increase in peripheral blood flow...|$|R
