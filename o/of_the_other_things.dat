25|$|This {{literature}} is remarkable {{for being in}} the vernacular (Old English) in the early medieval period: almost all other written literature was in Latin at this time, but due to Alfred's programme of vernacular literacy, the oral traditions of Anglo-Saxon England ended up being converted into writing and preserved. We owe much of this preservation to the monks of the tenth century, who made – {{at the very least}} – the copies of most of the literary manuscripts that still exist. Manuscripts were not common items. They were expensive and hard to make. First, cows or sheep had to be slaughtered and their skins tanned. Then people had to decide to use this leather for manuscripts rather than for any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> leather can be used for. The leather was then scraped, stretched, and cut into sheets, which were sewn into books. Then inks had to be made from oak galls and other ingredients, and the books had to be hand written by monks using quill pens. Every manuscript is slightly different from every other one, even if they are copies of each other, because every scribe had different handwriting and made different errors. We can sometimes identify individual scribes from their handwriting, and we can often guess where manuscripts were written because different scriptoria (centres of manuscript production) wrote in different styles of hand.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Doig, a {{professor}} at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 millionpeople attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken {{a little less than}} 45minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. In spite of his crowd estimate, Doig stated that [...] "if I had to bet, I would say the [...] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [...] or any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things...</b> I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd."

Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be}} a sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do that in my life now." [...] Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Kazmir {{averaged}} 4.28 pitches per plate {{appearance on}} the season, the highest rate in the majors. [...] "He's an ace {{as far as his}} numbers go", Baseball Prospectus wrote, [...] "But he doesn't do many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> one expects from an ace. He regularly misses time here and there (in 2008 it was an early-season elbow strain), he's so inefficient that he often hits 100 pitches before he's made it to the fifth inning, and he can become a scheduled strain on the bullpen.

2500|$|On November 8, 2008, a non-televised reunion {{to commemorate}} the show's 30th anniversary was held at Southfork Ranch in Parker, Texas, reuniting {{original}} cast members Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Ken Kercheval, Steve Kanaly and Charlene Tilton; other cast members in attendance were Susan Howard, Audrey Landers, Mary Crosby and Sheree J. Wilson. The front and back lawn of the fictional Ewing family home played host to a massive barbecue filled with people from the Dallas area, across the U.S. {{and around the world}} (who paid as much as $1,000) to reminisce and celebrate the series, as well as meeting with cast members. During the festivities, Kercheval said he was shocked to see the continued support for the show 17 years after it last aired: [...] "I don't understand it. The staying power. Who knew?" [...] Linda Gray also fondly remembered her time on the show: [...] "I think it was a special time.

2500|$|Helena Mulkerns in Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a rich mood piece of broad proportions" [...] and [...] "a glorious aural mosaic". The title track [...] "sails the {{listener}} gently into an ebb-and-flow movement that permeates the album" [...] that contains multi-vocals she described as [...] "distinctive" [...] and [...] "striking". She thought Roma's lyrics were [...] "unornamented but compelling", but its mutli-lingual touches [...] "enrich" [...] the listening experience without becoming too dominating. Kristine McKenna, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote a critical review who described it as [...] "a portentous pastiche that's drawn comparisons to ecclesiastical choir and Gregorian chant, but in fact sounds like nothing more than unusually windy New Age music" [...] which [...] "makes for bland, bloodless music ideal for elevators; this is a record about sound rather than lyrics, melody, or any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that invest music with emotion and ideas." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett rated the album five stars out of five, writing that it [...] "established her as the unexpected queen of gentle, Celtic-tinged new age music" [...] with a subtlety that produced strong tracks as a result. Raggett concluded: [...] "It's a perfect combination of timelessness and technology, an appropriate end to this fine album".|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{interpret}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> “climate change” {{in relation to}} Heidegger's critics of metaphysics and its accomplishment, the technical era. We will show that such criticism is developed basically as a one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will, respectively, with <b>the</b> metaphysical understanding <b>of</b> man as “master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth”. With <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will not only nature is reduced to a mere source of resources, but also the reality in general is understood only as objectivity. Its counterpart is the serenity. We will see that the serenity {{is based on a}} phenomenological-ethical approach that aspires to be a rescue of things. That ethical dimension will be discovered as a rescue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> (<b>things,</b> nature and human beings) and even as love. Finally we will argue that climate change does not require an environmental ethics, but rather an ethics of letting be...|$|R
