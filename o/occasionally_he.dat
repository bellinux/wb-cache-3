5|$|In 1886, Charley Powers {{organized}} a baseball club in New Castle and persuaded Lowe's employer {{to allow him}} to play with the club <b>occasionally.</b> <b>He</b> played catcher and third base for New Castle in 1886 and led the team in batting and baserunning.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to the {{presentation}} of the Swords to his Knight's Cross, he was officially banned from operational flying. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>he</b> still flew combat missions and on 23 March 1944, flying in defense of the Reich, he claimed his 162nd and last aerial victory and was killed in action by United States Army Air Forces long-range P-51 Mustang fighters near Schöppenstedt, in Lower Saxony.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} November, Chopin {{returned}} to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>he</b> played, or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of {{the centre of the}} city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.|$|E
60|$|General Westley was in what Wetmore {{called the}} bloom of age. He might be {{depended}} upon for the unexpected, like fate. <b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> did it, <b>he</b> <b>occasionally</b> said it, from the passive hospitality that characterized him.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to illustrating, <b>he</b> <b>occasionally</b> writes comics. <b>He</b> wrote {{a number of}} scripts for Harry Hill's adventures in TV land which was drawn by Nigel Parkinson.|$|R
60|$|When {{he entered}} the library he looked so serious that she asked him whether he had neuralgia, from which <b>he</b> <b>occasionally</b> suffered. <b>He</b> replied with some indignation that he had not, {{and that he had}} a {{communication}} of importance to make to her.|$|R
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>he</b> displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, but <b>occasionally</b> <b>he</b> acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{decided to}} reject the offer of the young Kansan (who {{followed}} through with the plan and was later killed), and {{that he needed to}} leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and <b>occasionally</b> <b>he</b> delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E
60|$|ZOO. Oh, {{he is one}} of the {{thoroughly}} degenerate shortlivers whom we <b>occasionally</b> produce. <b>He</b> emigrates.|$|R
50|$|Kevin still plays several songs off {{the album}} {{regularly}} (and some <b>occasionally)</b> when <b>he</b> plays with Thin Buckle.|$|R
5000|$|Fonseka wrote {{essays on}} a variety of topics, {{including}} many on the culture and history of Ceylon. His essays also addressed aspects of Catholic belief and life. <b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> published verse. <b>He</b> contributed regularly to Chesterton's magazine G. K.'s Weekly.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>he</b> grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
25|$|Recently, Popper {{formed a}} rock/jazz/hip-hop fusion group the John Popper Project with DJ Logic, which {{released}} an album in 2006 and performs <b>occasionally.</b> <b>He</b> also performs {{on the album}} Global Noize by Jason Miles and DJ Logic (2008).|$|E
25|$|Concerning Goddard's {{religious}} views, he {{was raised}} as an Episcopalian, though he was not outwardly religious. The Goddards {{were associated with the}} Episcopal church in Roswell, and he attended <b>occasionally.</b> <b>He</b> once spoke to a young people's group on the relationship of science and religion.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> lectures at universities.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{comments}} that <b>he</b> {{was a great}} sportsman in his youth, with a very athletic lifestyle. He is a former practitioner of the French martial art savate, although a demonstration in Flight 714 to Sydney shows {{him to be a}} bit rusty.|$|R
50|$|Shonosuke (Shōnosuke): Shonosuke is Yaiba's friend vulture. He helps Yaiba {{with his}} {{training}} and lets Yaiba ride {{him when he}} needs to fly. Like Kagetora, <b>he</b> <b>occasionally</b> ups Yaiba. <b>He</b> was probably found on the same mountain Yaiba and his father lived.|$|R
25|$|At Ajax, De Cler {{played at}} {{first as a}} left winger, but {{eventually}} he was positioned as a left-back {{when he reached the}} A-level in youth football. He was offered his first professional contract and joined Ajax's second team. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>he</b> was added to the first team squad to train with the elite at the club.|$|E
25|$|Benson later {{appeared}} on several tracks of a Goodman album released as Seven Come Eleven. In general Goodman {{continued to play}} in the swing style he was best known for. He did, however, practice and perform classical clarinet pieces and commissioned compositions for clarinet. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>he</b> organized a new band to play at a jazz festival or go on an international tour.|$|E
25|$|However, Ventura {{would still}} {{occasionally}} give credit {{where it was}} due, praising the athleticism of wrestlers such as Ricky Steamboat and Randy Savage, who was championed by Ventura for years, {{even when he was}} a face, a point Ventura regularly made on-air to McMahon and Monsoon. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>he</b> would even acknowledge mistakes made by the heels, including those made by his personal favorites such as Savage or wrestlers managed by heels Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart.|$|E
50|$|Gabe {{retired in}} 1908, but still {{appeared}} <b>occasionally</b> for Cardiff. <b>He</b> {{was a fine}} club cricketer and played <b>occasionally</b> for Glamorgan. <b>He</b> also captained Radyr Golf Club, and played at Cardiff Golf Club well into his eighties. He died in Cardiff in 1967.|$|R
50|$|Kaplan is {{not related}} to {{journalist}} Lawrence Kaplan, with whom <b>he</b> is <b>occasionally</b> confused. <b>He</b> is also sometimes confused with neoconservative scholar Robert Kagan.|$|R
50|$|Winston Anthony John Waite (born 26 February 1951) is a {{presenter}} on British {{radio and}} <b>occasionally</b> television. <b>He</b> {{has worked at}} the BBC since 1973.|$|R
25|$|In retirement, Arnold stayed {{active in}} {{aviation}}, joining the Cubic Corporation Board of Directors, the Golden Eagles, the San Diego Aerospace Museum {{and various other}} naval aviation oriented groups. Ever the artist, he continued drawing and working in his garden. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>he</b> would put an entry into the Rancho Santa Fe Garden Club show, almost always gaining a ribbon or two. Towards {{the end of his}} life, Jack {{spent most of his time}} in his living room watching television. He loved to watch cavalry, western, and action movies. A particular favorite was Walker, Texas Ranger.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Paul {{went into}} semi-retirement, {{although}} he did return to the studio <b>occasionally.</b> <b>He</b> and Ford had divorced {{at the end of}} 1964 after she got tired of touring. Paul's most recognizable recordings from then through the mid-1970s were an album for London Records/Phase 4 Stereo, Les Paul Now (1968), on which he updated some of his earlier hits; and two albums comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins, backed by some of Nashville's celebrated studio musicians, Chester and Lester (1976) and Guitar Monsters (1978), for RCA Victor.|$|E
25|$|In Chambersburg, young Martin {{continued}} learning. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>he</b> {{left school}} {{to work when}} his family could not afford for his education to continue. In 1831, {{at the age of}} 19, he journeyed west to the growing city of Pittsburgh, where he became a barber and laborer. Having heard stories about his parents' ancestors, he wanted to visit Africa, which he considered his spiritual home. Delany and three other young black men were accepted into Harvard Medical School but African Americans were not accepted into the school after white students reportedly petitioned the school to exclude non-white applicants.|$|E
50|$|Hinwood played league cricket for Clydach, Llanelli and Swansea, {{the latter}} of whom <b>he</b> <b>occasionally</b> captained. However, <b>he</b> made just one {{first-class}} appearance for Glamorgan, and was unfortunate to score a pair in the two innings in which he batted, against Northamptonshire in 1923.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{appears on}} STVs rugby programme.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{contributed to}} Le Courrier français.|$|R
25|$|Oscar {{has his own}} niche. He {{makes the}} {{traditional}} Trees of Life with the traditional theme of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden, but he also makes trees with other themes such as the life of Christ, the love story of a couple, and trees covered with monarch butterflies. <b>Occasionally</b> <b>he</b> creates trees with multiple faces, usually three, which cover diverse themes. For example, a tree can have a scene depicting the birth of Christ, the Last Supper and the Crucifixion. Another example is the courtship, marriage and death of a couple. To decorate the trees, fine brushes and paints made himself from natural pigments are generally used. The final piece receives a coat of glue-based varnish. Attention is paid to the details.|$|E
25|$|After {{celebrating the}} birth of his son, the first child with Morgan Beck, Miller {{announced}} in October, that he would skip another season with the intention {{to spend more time with}} his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this might mean the end of his skiing career, Miller denied it in December stating that although he would never do the full circuit again, there's a likelihood that he'd return to racing <b>occasionally.</b> <b>He</b> terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction to not compete with other skis than HEAD in the World Cup circuit or World Alpine Ski Championships. He was then able to sign a deal with US-based ski manufacturer Bomber Ski, which also made Miller the brand's part owner.|$|E
25|$|Ajith did {{not speak}} Tamil as a child, and {{mastered}} it only after becoming an actor. He dropped out of Asan Memorial Senior Secondary School in 1986 before completing his higher secondary. During his childhood, {{he had been a}} fan of M. G. Ramachandran, Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna. In his teenage years, he became a fan of Tamil acting icons Rajnikanth and Kamal Haasan. At 18, Ajith had to take up a job to support his career in racing. Joining as an apprentice, he rose to be a merchandiser with a garment export company, doing small-time press ads and TV commercials <b>occasionally.</b> <b>He</b> had put a lot of money into racing and would borrow tyres from his friends who used to help when the treads wore out, as there was no money in racing at that time. Following an accident, several business agencies pushed him into modelling for advertisements in print media. He had to make a choice between films and racing, and as the films were happening and generating him some money, he began concentrating on it. He debuted in En Veedu En Kanavar (1990) in a minor role as a school student.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> spelled {{his first}} name 'Phillip'.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{writes for}} Doctor Who Magazine.|$|R

He was playing for the New York Yankees at the time.|$|R
