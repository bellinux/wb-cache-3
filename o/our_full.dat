500|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} {{reviewed by the}} contemporary trade publications that garnered almost universal acclaim.

500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute <b>our</b> <b>full</b> story plan for season four. [...] This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal... so, hold on to your hats. [...] Those of you waiting for the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy. [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.|$|E
