5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents,</b> which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> positive potentials.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn2+ often competes with Mg2+ in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly {{restricted to the}} unstable oxide Mn2O7, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO4−, and a few oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl), are powerful <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents.</b> Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E
5|$|The +3 {{oxidation}} state {{is known in}} compounds like manganese(III) acetate, but these are quite powerful <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> and also prone to disproportionation in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect.|$|E

5|$|Thallium(III) {{compounds}} {{resemble the}} corresponding aluminium(III) compounds. They are moderately strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> {{and are usually}} unstable, {{as illustrated by the}} positive reduction potential for the Tl3+/Tl couple. Some mixed-valence compounds are also known, such as Tl4O3 and TlCl2, which contain both thallium(I) and thallium(III). Thallium(III) oxide, Tl2O3, is a black solid which decomposes above 800°C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of vanadium is noteworthy for {{the accessibility of}} the four adjacent oxidation states 25. In aqueous solution, vanadium forms metal aquo complexes of which the colours are lilac 2+, green 3+, blue 2+, yellow VO3−. Vanadium(II) compounds are reducing agents, and vanadium(V) compounds are <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents.</b> Vanadium(IV) compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives, which contain the VO2+ center.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E

50|$|A {{free radical}} is formed from the {{carboxylic}} acid in an oxidative decarboxylation with silver salts and an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> The <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> reoxidizes the silver salt. The radical then reacts with the aromatic compound. The ultimate product is formed by rearomatization. The acylated product is formed from the acyl radical.|$|R
50|$|Redox titrations {{are based}} on a reduction-oxidation {{reaction}} between an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> and a reducing agent. A potentiometer or a redox indicator is usually used to determine the endpoint of the titration, as when one of the constituents is the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> potassium dichromate. The color change of the solution from orange to green is not definite, therefore an indicator such as sodium diphenylamine is used. Analysis of wines for sulfur dioxide requires iodine as an <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> In this case, starch is used as an indicator; a blue starch-iodine complex is formed in the presence of excess iodine, signalling the endpoint.|$|R
5|$|Indium metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} {{are characteristic}} of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), but are not reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat soluble in water, the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution, is then attempted.|$|E

25|$|It can be {{seen that}} the values of Ecello for these {{reactions}} are similar, but nitric acid is a more powerful <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Base on the fact that dilute nitrous acid can oxidize iodide into iodine, it can be deduced that nitrous is a faster, rather than a more powerful, <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> than dilute nitric acid.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} epoxide {{formation}} experiment for a second-semester organic chemistry laboratory. This oxidation utilizes Oxone, a commercially available <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> in the industrially relevant process of epoxide formation. The oxidant performing the oxidation is dimethyldioxirane, which is formed in situ. This experiment demonstrates a simple synthesis of an epoxide and {{formation of a}} secondary <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|R
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents,</b> alkylating agents and also high-energy {{electromagnetic}} radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|Livermorium is {{projected}} to be the fourth member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 16 in the periodic table, below polonium. While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements, its chemistry {{is expected to be}} quite similar to that of polonium. The group oxidation state of +6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which lacks available d-orbitals for expansion of its octet and is itself one of the strongest <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> among the chemical elements. Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum +2 state, exhibited in the fluoride OF2. The +4 state is known for sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium, undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur(IV) and selenium(IV) through being the most stable state for tellurium(IV) to being oxidizing in polonium(IV). This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects, especially the inert pair effect. The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be +2, with a rather unstable +4 state. The +2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium, and the +4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands, such as in livermorium(IV) fluoride (LvF4). The +6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons, making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons. The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a −2 state as oxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride, and polonide; due to the destabilization of livermorium's 7p3/2 subshell, the −2 state should be very unstable for livermorium, whose chemistry should be essentially cationic, though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should stabilize Lv2− slightly.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents.</b> Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.|$|E

5000|$|Electron acceptors {{participate}} in electron-transfer reactions. In this context, the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> is called an electron acceptor and the reducing agent is called an electron donor. A classic <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> is the ferrocenium ion , which accepts an electron to form Fe(C5H5)2. One {{of the strongest}} acceptors commercially available is [...] "Magic blue", the radical cation derived from N(C6H4-4-Br)3.|$|R
25|$|The atom or {{molecule}} which loses electrons {{is known}} as the reducing agent, or reductant, and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> or oxidant. Thus, the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent</b> is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agent,</b> but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a fire can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; fluorine fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher electronegativity and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.|$|R

It will violently react with interhalogens (e.g., bromine pentafluoride; chlorine trifluoride). Its reaction with hot sodium, potassium or lithium is incandescent.|$|E
25|$|Manganates, {{particularly}} the insoluble barium manganate, BaMnO4, {{have been used}} as <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> in organic synthesis: they will oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids, and secondary alcohols to ketones.

25|$|While rubber {{is still}} used in textile manufacturing, its low {{tenacity}} limits {{its use in}} lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents</b> and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to neoprene (polymer of chloroprene), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, spandex (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes are {{oxidized}} with a {{large number}} of <b>oxidizing</b> <b>agents.</b> In the presence of oxygen, alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce carbon dioxide and water. Catalytic oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with percarboxylic acids yields epoxides. Reaction with ozone in ozonolysis leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two aldehydes or ketones. Reaction with concentrated, hot KMnO4 (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield ketones or carboxylic acids.|$|E
