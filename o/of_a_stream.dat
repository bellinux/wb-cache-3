5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As other southern California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed both sides <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) {{was the first to}} support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming both sides <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before Spanish {{colonization}} in the 1770s, the San Juan Creek watershed was {{inhabited by}} the Acjachemen or Juañeno Native Americans. The Juañeno were named by Spanish missionaries who built Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on the banks}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> they named San Juan Creek. The watershed was used mainly for agriculture and ranching until the 1950s when residential suburban development began on a large scale. Since then, the human population has continued to encroach on floodplains of local streams. Flooding in the 20th and 21st centuries has caused considerable property damage in the San Juan watershed.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the 35th Infantry {{took up a}} hill {{position}} {{northwest of}} Hamch'ang and south of Mun'gyong {{on the south side}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> that flowed past Sangju to the Naktong. On {{the north side of the}} stream an ROK battalion held the front line. Brigadier General Vennard Wilson, the 25th's Assistant Division Commander, ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of the stream, and this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins. Wilson thought the American troops would strengthen the ROK defense but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement. Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range. Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel. In the meantime, the ROK 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near Tongkwanri, forcing it to withdraw.|$|E

Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} access {{networks}} for proper support of multimedia applications requires <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> how {{the conditions of}} the underlying network (packet loss and delays, for instance) affect the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> media <b>stream.</b> In particular, network congestion can affect the user-perceived quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> media <b>stream.</b> By choosing metrics that indicate and/or predict the quality ranking that a user would assign to <b>a</b> media <b>stream,</b> we can deduce the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> media <b>stream</b> without polling users directly. We describe a measurement mechanism utilizing objective measurements taken from a media player application that strongly correlate with user rankings of stream quality. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the chosen metrics as predictors or indicators of user quality rankings, and suggest a new mechanism for evaluating the present and future quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> media <b>stream.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{algorithms}} for presynthesis estimation of hardware cost <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> accelerator. Our proposed estimation method helps {{to accelerate the}} design-spaceexploration phase by orders of magnitude by eliminating the need to perform logic and physical synthesis in each iteration. We present algorithms to perform early cost estimation of resources that are specific to <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> accelerator, and we evaluate our techniques using an industrial tool flow and <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> <b>streaming</b> benchmarks. For the register-queue sizes, our estimations {{are in the range}} of 28 %- 9 % of actual synthesis results on average, depending on the given resource constraints, while the datapath area estimations are within 14 %. A typical estimation requires less than a minute, while generating the configuration bitstream <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> accelerator can take as much as 30 min according to our experiments.
