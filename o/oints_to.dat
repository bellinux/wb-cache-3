40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{discourse}} of adolescence is best described as emblematic of modernity, as colonial, as gendered, and as administrative (Lesko, 2001) working to maintain “progressive” school literacy practices that ignore adolescents’ new “cyber-techno subjectivity” (Luke & Luke, 2001) and creativity in the “new media age” (Kress, 2003). School curricula often do not acknowledge the range of skills adolescents acquire outside formal education. Youths’ new multimodal social and cultural practices—as they fashion themselves creatively in multiple modes as {{different kinds of people}} in “New Times” (Luke, 1998) — <b>oints</b> <b>to</b> the liberating power of new technologies that embrace their imagination and creativity. In two middle years classes, adolescents’ creativity was recognised and validated when they were encouraged to re-represent curricular knowledge through multimodal design (New London Group, 1996). The results suggest the changed classroom habitus (Bourdieu, 1980) produced new and emergent discursive and material practices where creativity, through imaginative collaboration, emerges as capital in an economy of practice (Bourdieu, 1996). The findings suggest schools should recognize adolescents’ creativity—that often manifests itself through their cultural and social capital resources—as they integrate and adapt to the new affordances acquired through their out-of-school literacy practices. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. The {{struggle}} {{to liberate the}} continent of Africa from colonialism {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century represented an important epoch and as such this history needs to be documented accurately in whatever form for the benefit of posterity. Liberation struggle archives are of differing types and status, which reflects the diverse nature of the struggle itself. R ecords on the liberat ion struggles in Africa were created from within and outside Africa to document this historic ep och from the 1950 s to the 1990 s. These records have to be made available to the public for research, scholarship and general interest as they are a treasured na tional asset. In view of the above, it is the mandate of archivists to provide a means f or future generations to access historical sources. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether liberat ion struggle archives are being offered the continuum of c are throughout their lifecycle in order to make such access possible. Considering that few records were created during the struggle for emancipation notwithstanding their neglect, it is therefore incumbent upon archivists to pres erve the legacy of the libe ration struggle that is contained in those few records that were created. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The study used methodological triangulation techniques in order to capture the phenomenon under study in detail. The study’s’ population were the twenty three archival institutions within east and southern Africa, both public and private that is, which generated a response rate of 39 %. Due to the fact that the study population was geographically di spersed, the study employed self - administered questionnaires for data gathering. U nstructured interviews and observations were also used in a limited manner. The researcher administ ered an interview schedule to h e a ds of archival institutions within the eas t and s outhern African region. To complement the iii interviewing, an observation schedule was also used to record phenomena at selected archival institutions. T he data collected using qualitative techniques was content analyzed whilst SPSS was used for quanti tative data. The study unearthed some interesting developments. Liberation struggle archives had been identified and the requisite documentation put in place. T h is was evidenced by the restitution of archives which was an ongoing process albeit a problemat ic one. This process gives the overall picture that the liberation struggle was a global event as records are scattered in different parts of the world. The records so created are of varied nature as the media used to capture the record exists in a variety of forms with photographs predominant. The study also discovered that the arrangement of records was being done by qualified personnel, both archivists and manuscript librarians. In their efforts to promote access, most archival institutions employed a co mbination of finding aids with inventories and summary lists mostly used. Furthermore, t he existence of mechanisms, policies and procedures facilitates archival management practices. The present research established that all archival institutions had missi on statements and that th ese explicitly spelt out the mandate of the organizations. F or some institutions, these existed in written format. Formal p olices were generally in existence but were calibrated at various levels depending on an institution’s colle ction priorities. In this instance, the policy pertaining to digitization of liberation struggle archives was held in high regard and this explains why the majority of archival institutions preferred electronic media for duplicate copies. This preference p <b>oints</b> <b>to</b> the increasingly pervasive influence of digital technology. Archival institutions were liberal in their publication requirements though users had to acknowledge the institution as the source. The major challenge in the management of liberation str uggle records was the processing of backlog s. In addition, the study sought to establish whether archival institutions were providing resources in order to promote a n environment conducive to iv prolong ing the useable life of liberation struggle archives. The infrastructure in terms of knowledgeable and skilled personnel was in existence as the need for an academic background from which archival skills could be developed was given priority. The expertise in preservation management was mostly invested i n disast er planning and recovery, holdings maintenance and preservation planning. The research also established that the majority of archival institutions had a visitors ’ register in place al though its administration lacked consistency. The majority of archival in stitutions had air conditioning though maintenance records were non - existent. It was also noted that fumigation was prevalent and that restorative work was being done by the majority of institutions with the traditional technique s being the most popular. Equally important was the need to establish the preservation needs of the surveyed archival institutions. The study reve ale d that digitization was the most wid ely used preservation strategy and the majority of archival institutions had purpose - built storag e. Fire was considered the biggest threat to archival collections and the disaster plan mostly covered records, the physical building and the evacuation of people. Fire detection systems were in place and archival institutions were making use of their resp ective local fire departments to raise fire precautionary awareness and readiness. Security measures were generally in place though the use of Close Circuit Television (CCTV), cameras and alarm systems was not pronounced. Furthermore, the study identified that information communication technologies had a transformative influence on the management of liberation struggle archives. The majority of the institutions were digitizing their collections though there was no written policy for managing these digital records. It was also established that most archival institutions were not migrating their records. Technological obsolescence and lack of resources were considered by most institutions as constituting the major threats to the survival of digital records an d this could be the reason why donor assistance v was sought as evidenced by the state of the art equipment on digitization infrastructure observed in some institutions visited. Equally significant was the revelation that inherent semantic ambiguities existe d in the legislative apparatus of the majority of archival institutions which partly explains why there was much passivity when it came to managing private records. The study further established that the management of private records was not satisfactory a nd areas noted for concern pertained to the arrangement, storage and custody, finding aids and access relating to these records. Finally, the study put forward a number of recommendations that had to be considered in an attempt to help archival institutio ns professionally manage liberation struggle archives, and two are cited here simply because they encapsulat e others. Firstly, the legislative apparatus had to be modernized in order for liberation struggle archives to be taken care of at national and not organizational level as is presently the case. The implication is that the laws that govern the national archives of countries within ESARBICA are wholly inadequate when it comes to the management of the private record. Lastly, the records continuum model formed the theoretical foundation of the study not only because of its holist ic approach, pragmatism and the fact that it is technologically driven but because it dovetailed with the records keeping issues which the study investigated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} topology optimization of both geometrically and materially nonlinear structures for energy absorption. The optimization problem is formulated by using the element as design variables. The element sensitivity number is derived from using the adj <b>oint</b> method <b>to</b> address two principal design parameters, namely absorbed energy per unit volume and absorbed energy ratio. Filter techniques are used to smooth sensitivities in space and to eliminate unnecessary structural details below a certain length-scale. The bi-directional evolutionary optimization (BESO) technique is used {{to search for the}} optimal design in the whole design domain by gradually removing and adding material.

40|$|In this article, we analize {{an aspect}} of the worker world that is still unexplored: {{collective}} bargaining. We understand it as one of the multiple ways of class struggle. To reflect about this facet of the worker’s conflict, we approach the collective negotiation experience driven by the ‘fileterxs’ between 1969 - 1970. At least two reasons motivate us to realize this approach.   First, the labour agreement from that period, give us a privileged <b>oint</b> of view <b>to</b> come close to the origins of a new fraction of fish workers, which found its top in the collective negotiation process  in 1975 and in the strikes procedures that the negotiation produced. Since that moment, the identity of male and female fish workers, mimetized with the fileterxs identity. Second, a detailed analysis of the labour agreement, allows us to see, the reconstruction of the correlations of forces between the Union and the Chamber in its several dimensions: process of work, organizational resources, politict horizon...|$|R
40|$|The highly {{populated}} and industrialised {{areas of}} New South Wales are the 2 ̆ 2 have nots 2 ̆ 2 {{with respect to}} natural gas reserves but {{are one of the}} largest markets for natural gas in Australia. Natural gas supplies are brought to these areas by a 1300 km long pipeline from the Cooper Basin in the northeast corner of South Australia. The expanding natural gas market in New South Wales will require, in the next decades, guaranteed supplies even in the event of insufficient deliverability through the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline or cut-off of the pipeline. Subsurface storage of natural gas in natural reservoirs near the market area offers one solution for guaranteeing supplies to this increasing market. Petroleum exploration wells drilled between 1910 and 1973 in the Sydney Basin near Sydney tested the petroleum potential of the Permian Nowra Sandstone, Muree Sandstone and Snapper Point Formation. The present petrological, wireline log, structural and reservoir engineering study of water-bearing arenites in these formations resulted in the delineation of seven potential natural reservoirs near Sydney, suitable for storage and retrieval of natural gas. The structures of these reservoirs include both faulted and unfaulted gently folded anticlines, and an irregular dome. The areal extent and vertical closure range from 1 to 45 km 2 and 15 to 225 m respectively. The cap rocks to the seven reservoirs are Permian impermeable arenites, siltstone, claystone and shale beds of the Berry Formation, Mulbring Siltstone, Wandrawandian Siltstone, and Snapper Point Formation. In spite of the growth of authigenic quartz, calcite, and siderite which has considerably reduced the primary intergranular porosity, the quantitative evaluation of wireline logs indicates the remaining average porosity for potential reservoirs in the Nowra and Muree Sandstone to be from 5. 5 - 12. 2 percent and from 5. 4 - 6. 8 percent in the Snapper <b>oint</b> Formation. Permeabilities <b>to</b> dry nitrogen gas for the Nowra and Muree Sandstone range from 1. 0 to 23. 4 millidarcies and for the Snapper Point Formation from 1. 5 to 98. 5 millidarcies. A total potential storage capacity for the seven reservoirs is estimated to be 21 342 x 106 m 3 of natural gas. Dural South Nowra Sandstone reservoir 8 878 x 10 6 m 3 of natural gas East Maitland Muree Sandstone reservoir 4 994 x 10 6 m 3 of natural gas Kurrajong Heights Snapper Point Formation reservoir 4 730 x 106 m 3 of natural gas Kurrajong Heights Berry Formation - Nowra Sandstone 1 546 x 106 m 3 of natural gas reservoir Mulgoa Nowra Sandstone reservoir 922 x 106 m 3 of natural gas Stockyard Mountain Snapper Point Formation reservoir 180 x 106 m 3 of natural gas Woronora Nowra Sandstone reservoir 92 x 106 m 3 of natural gas Their respective deliverability potential ranges from 0. 041 0. 256 x 106 m 3 of natural gas per day per well. The potential storage reservoirs delineated in this study are favourably situated to the New South Wales gas markets of Sydney Metropolitan Area (Dural South, Mulgoa and Kurrajong, Heights); Wollongong - Port Kembla and the South Coast (Woronora and Stockyard Mountain); and Newcastle - Hunter Valley (East Maitland). These reservoirs are also favourably situated relative to the existing pipelines: Moomba - Sydney (Wilton, 2 ̆ 7 City Gate 2 ̆ 7); Wilton, 2 ̆ 7 City Gate 2 ̆ 7 - Wollongong, {{as well as to the}} proposed gas pipeline from Wilton, 2 ̆ 7 City Gate 2 ̆ 7 to Newcastle. Apart from their primary function as natural gas storage reservoirs for peak shaving and security of supply, they could also be used for storing gas manufactured. from coal. Of the three alternatives (duplication of Moomba - Sydney gas pipeline, building of liquid natural gas plants or development of subsurface gas storage) for adequate supply of gas to the New South Wales market, it would appear that the development of subsurface storage in natural reservoirs would be by far the most economically viable...|$|R
