5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result in the perception <b>of</b> <b>vertigo.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause <b>of</b> <b>vertigo,</b> a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) is a disorder arising from {{a problem in}} the inner ear. Symptoms are repeated, brief periods <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> with movement, that is, of a spinning sensation upon changes in the position of the head. This can occur with turning in bed or changing position. Each episode <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> typically lasts less than one minute. Nausea is commonly associated. BPPV {{is one of the most}} common causes <b>of</b> <b>vertigo.</b>|$|E

25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} {{is more likely}} in someone who gets repeated episodes <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E

40|$|Dizziness can be {{classified}} mainly into 4 types: vertigo, disequilibrium, presyncope, and lightheadedness. Among these types, vertigo is a sensation of movement or motion due to various causes. The main causes <b>of</b> peripheral <b>vertigo</b> are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), acute vestibular neuritis (AVN), and Meniere’s disease. BPPV {{is one of the most}} common causes <b>of</b> peripheral <b>vertigo.</b> It is characterized by brief episodes of mild to intense vertigo, which are triggered by specific changes in the position of the head. BPPV is diagnosed from the characteristic symptoms and by observing the nystagmus such as in the Dix-Hallpike test. BPPV is treated with several canalith repositioning procedures. AVN is the second most common cause <b>of</b> peripheral <b>vertigo.</b> Its key symptom is the acute onset <b>of</b> sustained rotatory <b>vertigo</b> without hearing loss. It is treated with symptomatic therapy with antihistamines, anticholinergic agents, anti-dopaminergic agents, and gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing agents that are used for symptoms <b>of</b> acute <b>vertigo.</b> Meniere’s disease is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus. It is traditionally relieved with life-style modification, a low-salt diet, and prescription of diuretics. However, diag-nosis and treatment <b>of</b> the peripheral <b>vertigo</b> can be difficult without knowledge of BPPV, AVN, and Meniere’s disease. This article provides information on the differential diagnosis <b>of</b> peripheral <b>vertigo</b> in BPPV, AVN...|$|R

25|$|Motion {{sickness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent symptoms <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> and develops most often in persons with inner ear problems. The feeling of dizziness and lightheadedness is often accompanied by nystagmus (an involuntary movement of the eye characterized by a smooth pursuit eye movement followed by a rapid saccade in the opposite direction of the smooth pursuit eye movement). During a single episode <b>of</b> <b>vertigo,</b> this action will occur repeatedly. Symptoms can fade while sitting still with the eyes closed.|$|E

Confirmation <b>of</b> a peripheral <b>vertigo</b> syndrome substantially lowers the likelihood of cerebellar infarction, as do indicators of a peripheral disorder such as an abnormal head impulse test. Approximately 10 % of patients with cerebellar infarction present with vertigo and no localizing neurologic deficits. The majority of these may have other signs <b>of</b> central <b>vertigo,</b> specifically direction-changing nystagmus and severe ataxia. [West J Emerg Med. 2009; 10 (4) : 273 - 277. ...|$|R

25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) {{is the most}} common vestibular disorder and occurs when loose calcium carbonate debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion.

25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms <b>of</b> <b>vertigo,</b> and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction <b>of</b> <b>vertigo</b> and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
25|$|The HINTS test, {{which is}} a {{combination}} of three physical exam tests that may be performed by physicians at the bedside has been deemed helpful in differentiating between central and peripheral causes <b>of</b> <b>vertigo.</b> The HINTS test involves: the horizontal head impulse test, observation of nystagmus on primary gaze, and the test of skew. CT scans or MRIs are sometimes used by physicians when diagnosing vertigo.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels {{as if they are}} moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it {{has little to do with}} the pathophysiology or treatment <b>of</b> <b>vertigo.</b>|$|E
