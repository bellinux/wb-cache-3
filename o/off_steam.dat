With these weekly gatherings for energetic dancing to let <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> and meet new friends, homosexuals felt the first bonds of a relatively cohesive community- a warm feeling of being welcomed into a new brotherhood, in contradistinction to erstwhile isolation, alienation and loneliness for many.|$|E
25|$|Allow {{time to let}} <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> - It is {{possible}} that one party may feel angry or frustrated {{at some point during}} the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback to the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|The Aggro Dome was {{conceived}} {{as a way for}} frustrated citizens to let <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> without endangering their fellow Meggers. Within the domes, citizens can vent their anger on robots, mock storefronts, and parked vehicles. Aggro Limited, the owners of the Aggro Dome franchise, petitioned for Judge replicoids to be added to a number of their buildings as a target for client retaliation. The request was promptly refused. After problems on opening day Dredd did his best to close the place for good but failed. Eventually the dome closed in the mid 2120s after visitor numbers fell too low to turn a profit.|$|E

25|$|A team of Vatican-sponsored vampire hunters led by Jack Crow rids an {{abandoned}} house of vampires {{in the middle}} of New Mexico during a daylight raid. The team uses a coordinated method of using battle pikes as harpoons, spearing vampires within the house so that a mechanical winch can pull them outside into the daylight. After clearing the house, the team celebrates at a local motel with drinking and prostitutes, to the disapproval of the Priest assigned to the team. Jack Crow defends the celebration, stating that given the horrors the team witnesses on a daily basis, this is an effective way to blow <b>off</b> <b>steam.</b> During the height of the party, with most of the team drunk, they are attacked swiftly by a master vampire called Valek, who kills most of the team and their priest. Only two members of the team survive, Jack Crow and Tony Montoya, as well as a prostitute named Katrina who was bitten by Valek. Crow later meets his boss, Cardinal Alba, who introduces him to Father Adam Guiteau.|$|E

500|$|On {{the boat}} deck, as the crew began {{preparing}} the lifeboats, {{it was difficult}} to hear anything over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. Lawrence Beesley described the sound as [...] "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck." [...] The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E
500|$|Farnborough stopped, blew <b>off</b> <b>steam,</b> and {{launched}} a boat to simulate a surrender. As U-68 closed to , Farnborough raised the White Ensign, uncovered her guns and opened fire with three of her five 12 pounder (76mm) guns. The British gunners scored several hits on the U-boat out of 21 rapidly fired rounds. As U-68 began to sink, Campbell steered Farnborough over U-68s location and dropped a depth charge that blew {{the bow of the}} submarine out of the water. As U-68 began going down by the stern, Farnboroughs gunners scored another five hits on the U-boat's conning tower. U-68 sank with the loss of all 38 men at position [...] off Dingle in southern Ireland. U-68 sank no ships during her brief service career.|$|E
500|$|After leaving university, Hubbard {{is said to}} {{have carried}} out a further {{expedition}} to Puerto Rico. It is described by a 1959 biography as having been undertaken to [...] "blow <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> by leading an expedition into Central America [...] ". An account published in Mission into Time states [...] "Conducting the West Indies Minerals Survey, he made the first complete mineralogical survey of Puerto Rico. This was pioneer exploration in the great tradition, opening up a predictable, accurate body of data for the benefit of others. Later, in other, less materialistic fields, this was to be his way many, many times over." [...] The Church of Scientology claims that Hubbard's father [...] "had long dreamed of augmenting his Lieutenant's pay with a mining venture and a bit of investment capital from like-minded officers" [...] and dispatched Hubbard to the Puerto Rican hinterland where he [...] "sluiced inland rivers and crisscrossed the island in search of elusive gold." [...] While there, Hubbard [...] "conducted much ethnological work amongst the interior villages and native hillsmen".|$|E

500|$|Steam's {{predominance}} in {{the gaming}} market {{has led to}} Valve becoming involved in various legal cases involving Steam. The lack of a formal refund policy led the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to sue Valve in September 2014 for violating Australian consumer laws that required stores to offer refunds for faulty or broken products. The Commission won the lawsuit in March 2016, though recognizing Valve changed its policy in the interim. The ACCC argued to the court that Valve should be fined 3 million Australian dollars [...] "in order to achieve both specific and general deterrents, and {{also because of the}} serious nature of the conduct" [...] prior to their policy changes. Valve argued that from the previous court case that [...] "no finding that Valve's conduct was intended to mislead or deceive consumers", and argued for only a [...] fine. In December 2016, the court ruled with the ACCC and fined Valve , as well as requiring Valve to include proper language for Australian consumers outlining their rights when purchasing games <b>off</b> <b>Steam.</b>|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally mixed to positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 19 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". [...] Some writers noted and praised the heavy use of electronic, bass and funk beats, while others suggest The Neptunes {{were unable to}} blend R and rock. Anthony Henriques of PopMatters lauded the production, saying that [...] "their signature drums and spaced-out samples sound as good as ever here", going on to say [...] "he overall balance between live and electronic instrumentation is also the best they have managed {{on any of the}} N.E.R.D. albums". He compared the album to M.I.A.'s Kala as [...] "one of the best genre-blurring club records". However, Andy Kellman of Allmusic felt the songs [...] "still have a way of seeming as easy and carefree as the moments when N.E.R.D. are simply bashing away…blowing <b>off</b> <b>steam,</b> and talking ridiculous nonsense". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian pointed out that the songs were [...] "largely about sex", calling it [...] "wearisome". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media called the album a [...] "baffling, obnoxious mess". Adrian Ruhi of Okayplayer gave the album a score of 88 out of 100 and called some of the songs [...] "a dynamic mess", but noted it was [...] "a good thing".|$|E

Otherwise, 'it amounted {{to no more than}} a protest, an escape valve through which the legislators blew <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> to relieve their tensions.'…However solemn or spirited, interposition resolutions have no legal efficacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Doullens Conference (26 March), Haig {{accepted}} {{the appointment of}} Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed {{much of the credit}} for Foch's appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Petain than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. However, the typed version of Haig's diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and {{it has been suggested that}} Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply letting <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. Wilson recorded that Haig seemed [...] "10 years younger" [...] that evening after Doullens.|$|E
2500|$|The Senator explosion, as {{with the}} Gazelle 21 years before, was blamed on her engineer's having allowed low water in her boilers, so that when her engines were shut <b>off,</b> <b>steam</b> {{pressure}} built up too quickly, causing boiler failure. [...] Low water in the boiler was a situation where flames and hot gases from the firebox were allowed to have {{direct contact with the}} metal boiler tubes and other critical components when there should have been a barrier of water preventing this. [...] The result would be either weakening of the metal over time or too quick a buildup in steam pressure, either one causing failure of the boiler jacket, that is, an explosion. [...] Hunter, in his thorough survey on the subject, cautions however that low boiler water, while often a cause of an explosion, was not always a good enough explanation, and that it had been shown by experiments as early as 1836 that a well-filled boiler could still explode, and that overheating caused by low water in the boiler frequently but not always led to an explosion.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were three}} {{conferences}} at Doullens on 26 March. The first was between Haig and his Army Commanders (except Gough). There {{was then a}} second with them and Wilson and Milner, {{who was able to}} bring assurances of French help from Clemenceau and Foch. The main conference was attended by Poincare, Clemenceau, Petain and Foch, as well as Haig, Wilson and Milner. Haig accepted the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed much of the credit for Foch’s appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Petain across the whole front, not just the Amiens sector, than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. The typed diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and Sheffield's view is that Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply letting <b>off</b> <b>steam</b> and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. In his diary for that day Haig accused Petain of [...] "funk". He was later to make the same accusation against the King on 29 March and Lloyd George on 3 April; Harris suggests that he was attributing to others an emotion of which he felt ashamed in himself. After the conference Haig went riding (his main form of relaxation) {{for the first time in}} days, and Wilson recorded that he seemed “10 years younger” that evening.|$|E
