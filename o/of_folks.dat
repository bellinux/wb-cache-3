40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three main chapters which investigate folk religion in Chinese societies (mainland and Taiwan). Field research performed in many parts China has documented the revival <b>of</b> <b>folk</b> religious practices and beliefs, but until now few rigorous quantitative studies have been performed to investigate its demographic characteristics, longitudinal trajectories, and civic functions. This dissertation studies these aspects <b>of</b> Chinese <b>folk</b> religion. Chapter 2 examines the number <b>of</b> <b>folk</b> religion adherents and their demographic characteristics in both mainland and Taiwan. The results suggest {{that in spite of}} the dramatic social, political, and cultural changes in modern times, the adherents <b>of</b> <b>folk</b> religion still substantially outnumber the believers of institutional religions in Chinese societies. Chapter 3 revisits Weber 2 ̆ 7 s classic discussion about disenchantment and recent theoretical development in the religious market approach about the failure <b>of</b> <b>folk</b> religion on a free religious market. In particular, Chapter 3 examines the longitudinal trends of different types <b>of</b> <b>folk</b> religion in Taiwan between 1990 and 2009. The findings highlight the decline <b>of</b> communal <b>folk</b> religion and the growth of certain types <b>of</b> individual <b>folk</b> religion. Chapter 4 focuses on the civic functions of different types <b>of</b> <b>folk</b> religion. Members <b>of</b> sectarian <b>folk</b> religion are found to be more likely to get involved in volunteering within religious organizations while participants <b>of</b> individual <b>folk</b> religion have significantly higher propensity to donate to both religious and secular organizations. ...|$|R

Not all members could write music when Folks first formed in 2013, but learnt to after months of sharing ideas.

All five people practised music in their own rooms, but because Katsutoshi Iwai's room was a Japanese style room, the other band members could hear him through the thin shōji walls. Originally Fumito Iwai thought that they would not work well together musically with Katsutoshi Iwai and Takahashi, since they both enjoyed [...] 1990s British rock and grunge. However, in late 2012, Fumito Iwai heard his brother composing the song [...] "River", and enjoyed it so much he asked to arrange the song.
