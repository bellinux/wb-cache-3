5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as <b>ozone</b> depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the <b>Ozone</b> Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} <b>ozone</b> depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm <b>ozone).</b> Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, <b>ozone</b> and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of <b>ozone</b> and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure <b>ozone</b> and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about <b>ozone</b> depletion and the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> hole.|$|E

5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the <b>ozone</b> layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce <b>ozone</b> during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global <b>ozone</b> levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in <b>ozone</b> is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric <b>ozone</b> depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the <b>ozone</b> layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s an {{important}} focus of {{study has been}} the <b>ozone</b> layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at Halley Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered {{the existence of a}} hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the <b>ozone</b> was caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the Montreal Protocol of 1989, climate projections indicate that the <b>ozone</b> layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.|$|E
5|$|Some recent {{evidence}} {{points to}} <b>ozone</b> as a possible contributing factor to the worldwide decline of amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} <b>ozone</b> depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). <b>Ozone</b> absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. <b>Ozone</b> depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the <b>ozone</b> depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Ozone</b> Awards is an {{awards show}} focused on Southern musicians. Brown has won one award of two nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and {{gave rise to the}} <b>ozone</b> layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the <b>ozone</b> layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Trees provide {{benefits}} such as absorbing carbon dioxide, {{and other}} pollutants. Trees also provide shade and reduce <b>ozone</b> emissions from vehicles. By having many trees, we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 degrees to 20 degrees, which will help reducing <b>ozone</b> and helping communities that are mostly affected by the {{effects of climate change}} and urban heat islands.|$|E

5|$|Ricketts' {{stone house}} {{served as the}} base for the <b>Ozone</b> hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's {{excursions}} on the mountain; the club gave its name to <b>Ozone</b> waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> {{depletion}} describes {{two related}} phenomena observed {{since the late}} 1970s: a steady decline of about four percent in {{the total amount of}} <b>ozone</b> in Earth's stratosphere (the <b>ozone</b> layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric <b>ozone</b> around Earth's polar regions. The latter phenomenon {{is referred to as the}} <b>ozone</b> hole. There are also springtime polar tropospheric <b>ozone</b> depletion events in addition to these stratospheric phenomena.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} had {{a significant}} effect on <b>ozone</b> levels in the atmosphere, causing a large increase in the destruction rate of <b>ozone.</b> <b>Ozone</b> levels at middle latitudes reached their lowest recorded levels, while in the southern hemisphere winter of 1992, the <b>ozone</b> hole over Antarctica reached its largest ever size until then, with the fastest recorded <b>ozone</b> depletion rates. The eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile in August 1991 also contributed to southern hemisphere <b>ozone</b> destruction, with measurements showing a sharp decrease in <b>ozone</b> levels at the tropopause when the aerosol clouds from Pinatubo and Hudson arrived.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{global warming}} {{potential}} of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> is between 918–1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent/tons tropospheric <b>ozone.</b> This means on a per-molecule basis, <b>ozone</b> in the troposphere has a radiative forcing effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as carbon dioxide. However, tropospheric <b>ozone</b> is a short-lived greenhouse gas, which decays in the atmosphere {{much more quickly than}} carbon dioxide. This means that over a 20-year span, the {{global warming potential}} of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons carbon dioxide equivalent / ton tropospheric <b>ozone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> {{destruction}} occurs principally in polar regions, but {{the formation}} of <b>ozone</b> occurs principally in the tropics. <b>Ozone</b> is distributed around the planet by the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Therefore, the source and dispersal pattern of aerosols is critical in understanding their effect on the <b>ozone</b> layer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> {{generators}} {{are used}} to produce <b>ozone</b> for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These <b>ozone</b> generators can produce over 3 g of <b>ozone</b> per hour. <b>Ozone</b> often forms in nature under conditions where O2 will not react. <b>Ozone</b> used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m3, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved <b>ozone</b> concentrations in output water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> {{precursors}} are a {{group of}} pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels. Ground-level <b>ozone</b> pollution (tropospheric <b>ozone)</b> is created near the Earth's surface {{by the action of}} daylight UV rays on these precursors. The <b>ozone</b> at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but methane is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of <b>ozone</b> at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level <b>ozone</b> far above background levels.|$|E
25|$|South <b>Ozone</b> Park is {{an urban}} {{neighborhood}} in <b>Ozone</b> Park, but despite its name, South <b>Ozone</b> Park is {{mostly in the}} east of the neighborhood of <b>Ozone</b> Park. It extends from the Aqueduct Racetrack eastward to the Van Wyck Expressway. Its main thoroughfare is Rockaway Boulevard. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community Board 10.|$|E

25|$|UV <b>ozone</b> generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) <b>ozone</b> generators, {{employ a}} light source that generates a {{narrow-band}} ultraviolet light, {{a subset of}} that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the <b>ozone</b> layer in the stratosphere of Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerosols}} {{have a role}} in {{the destruction}} of <b>ozone</b> due to surface chemistry effects. Destruction of <b>ozone</b> has in recent years created large holes in the <b>ozone</b> layer, initially over the Antarctic and then the Arctic. These holes in the <b>ozone</b> layer have the potential to expand to cover inhabited and vegetative regions of the planet, leading to catastrophic environmental damage.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{environmental factor}} in the food price crisis is rising background levels of ground-level tropospheric <b>ozone</b> in the atmosphere. Plants {{have been shown to}} have a high sensitivity to <b>ozone</b> levels, and lower yields of important food crops, such as wheat and soybeans, may have been a result of elevated <b>ozone</b> levels. <b>Ozone</b> levels in the Yangtze Delta were studied for their effect on oilseed rape, a member of the cabbage family that produces one-third of the vegetable oil used in China. Plants grown in chambers that controlled <b>ozone</b> levels exhibited a 10–20 percent reduction in size and weight (biomass) when exposed to elevated <b>ozone</b> levels. Production of seeds and oil was also reduced. The Chinese authors of this study also reported that rice grown in chambers that controlled <b>ozone</b> levels exhibited a 14 to 20 percent reduction in biomass yield when exposed to <b>ozone</b> levels over 25 times higher than was normal for the region.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> (3) is {{generated}} by passing oxygen (2) through a high voltage potential resulting in a third oxygen atom becoming attached and forming 3. <b>Ozone</b> is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. <b>Ozone</b> {{is considered to be}} safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous {{in the event of an}} accidental release), <b>ozone</b> {{is generated}} on-site as needed. Ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of <b>ozone</b> disinfection is the high cost of the <b>ozone</b> generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> Park and South <b>Ozone</b> Park {{have large}} Italian, Hispanic, and Guyanese populations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> {{production}} rises during heat waves, because plants absorb less <b>ozone.</b> It {{is estimated}} that curtailed <b>ozone</b> absorption by plants {{was responsible for the}} loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006. A similar investigation to assess the joint effects of <b>ozone</b> and heat during the European heat waves in 2003, concluded that these appear to be additive.|$|E
25|$|Increased surface UV {{leads to}} {{increased}} tropospheric <b>ozone.</b> Ground-level <b>ozone</b> is generally recognized to be a health risk, as <b>ozone</b> is toxic {{due to its}} strong oxidant properties. The risks are particularly high for young children, the elderly, and those with asthma or other respiratory difficulties. At this time, <b>ozone</b> at ground level is produced mainly {{by the action of}} UV radiation on combustion gases from vehicle exhausts.|$|E
25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create <b>ozone.</b> <b>Ozone</b> can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to <b>ozone</b> cracking. Exposure to <b>ozone</b> creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where <b>ozone</b> can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{creation}} of NO2 is the critical step leading to low level <b>ozone</b> formation, it also increases this <b>ozone</b> in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with <b>ozone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with outdoor air is effective {{to the extent}} that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. <b>Ozone</b> in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because <b>ozone</b> is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between <b>ozone</b> and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of <b>ozone</b> chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor ventilation rate, the higher the indoor <b>ozone</b> concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that <b>ozone</b> should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor <b>ozone</b> levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor <b>ozone</b> and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|E
25|$|The Antarctic <b>ozone</b> hole {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} {{in which}} the recent <b>ozone</b> levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The <b>ozone</b> hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this polar vortex, over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric <b>ozone</b> is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone</b> is used {{in homes}} and hot tubs to kill {{bacteria}} {{in the water and}} {{to reduce the amount of}} chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since <b>ozone</b> does not remain in the water long enough, <b>ozone</b> by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with halogens. Gaseous <b>ozone</b> created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ozone,</b> while a {{minority}} constituent in Earth's atmosphere, {{is responsible for}} most of the absorption of UVB radiation. The amount of UVB radiation that penetrates through the <b>ozone</b> layer decreases exponentially with the slant-path thickness and density of the layer. When stratospheric <b>ozone</b> levels decrease, higher levels of UVB reach the Earth’s surface. UV-driven phenolic formation in tree rings has dated the start of <b>ozone</b> depletion in northern latitudes to the late 1700s.|$|E
