40|$|Nowadays, viable estimations of {{transonic}} aerodynamic loads can {{be obtained}} through the tools of computational fluid dynamics. Nonetheless, even with the increasing available computer power, the cost of solving the related non-linear, large order models still impedes their widespread use in conceptual/preliminary aircraft design phases, whereas the related nonlinearities might critically affect design decisions. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop methods capable of providing adequately precise reduced order models, compressing large order aerodynamic systems within a highly reduced number of states. This work tackles such a problem through a discrete time recursive neural network formulation, identifying compact models through a training based on input–output data obtained from high-fidelity simulations of the aerodynamic problem alone. The soundness of such an approach is verified by first evaluating the aerodynamic loads resulting from the harmonic motion of an airfoil in transonic regime and then checking aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations inferred from such a reduced <b>neural</b> system <b>against</b> high fidelity response analyses...|$|R

40|$|Some {{heavy metals}} have been {{suspected}} of {{playing a role}} in the pathogenesis of nervous system diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. In these disorders, autoantibodies <b>against</b> <b>neural</b> proteins are evident at some stage of the disease. Lead is known to affect both the immune and nervous systems. Work in our laboratory has shown that lead exposure leads to the production of autoantibodies <b>against</b> <b>neural</b> proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We hypothesize that lead aggravates neurological disease by enhancing the immunogenicity of nervous system proteins, including MBP and GFAP. To test this hypothesis, lead-altered protein was prepared by incubating MBP or GFAP with lead acetate for 24 hr. On days 0, 14, and 28, mice received inoculations with either saline, native protein, or lead-altered protein. Anti-MBP and anti-GFAP, isotypes IgM and IgG, were measured in sera by ELISA on day 38. Sera of mice treated with lead-altered MBP had statistically higher anti-MBP IgG titers than both control and native MBP-immunized mice. An analogous response was seen in mice immunized with lead-altered GFAP. Supernatants from lectin-stimulated splenocytes were also examined for antibody titers and for interleukin 2 (IL- 2) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) levels. A significant increase in IL- 6 production was seen in mice immunized with lead-altered MBP but not with lead-altered GFAP.

A less investigated problem is the board representation conveying the information on the current state of the game to the network. Common approaches suggest a straight–forward encoding by assigning each point on the board to a single (or more) input neurons. However, these basic representations do not capture elementary structural relationships between stones (and points) being essential to the game. We compare three different board representations for self–learning ANNs on a 5 × 5 board employing temporal difference learning (TDL) with two types of move selection (during training). The strength of the trained networks is evaluated in games against three computer players of different quality. A tournament of the best neural players, addition of α–β search, and a commented game of a <b>neural</b> player <b>against</b> the best computer player further explore the potential of the neural players and its respective board representations...|$|R

We report here the molecular {{cloning and functional characterization}} of a human olfactory UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). The cloned protein is composed of 527 amino acids with an identity of 87 % with a rat olfactory UGT and of 43 - 62 % with other human UGT isoforms. Based on the sequence homology, it has been designated hUGT 2 A 1. The gene was mapped to chromosome 4 q 13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The expression appeared to be specific for the olfactory tissue. The substrate specificity of this isoform was assessed using Chinese hamster V 79 cells stably transfected with the isolated cDNA.

Excessive {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA, which result in cell damage and death. The outcomes can be acute, as seen in stroke, or more chronic as observed in age-related diseases such as Parkinson’s disease.

But there {{have not been}} rigorous evaluations showing for exactly which tasks this syntax-based method is appropriate. In this paper we benchmark recursive <b>neural</b> models <b>against</b> sequential recurrent <b>neural</b> models (simple recurrent and LSTM models), enforcing apples-to-apples comparison as much as possible. We investigate 4 tasks: (1) sentiment classification at the sentence level and phrase level; (2) matching questions to answer-phrases; (3) discourse parsing; (4) semantic relation extraction (e. g., component-whole between nouns). Our goal is to understand better when, and why, recursive models can outperform simpler models. We find that recursive models help mainly on tasks (like semantic relation extraction) that require associating headwords across a long distance, particularly on very long sequences. We then introduce a method for allowing recurrent models to achieve similar performance: breaking long sentences into clause-like units at punctuation and processing them separately before combining. Our results thus help understand the limitations of both classes of models, and suggest directions for improving recurrent models...|$|R

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} response {{is probably one}} of the main destructive events occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). Its progression depends mostly on the autoimmune response developed <b>against</b> <b>neural</b> constituents. Therefore, modulation or inhibition of this self-reactive reaction could help to reduce tissue destruction. Anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID) is a phenomenon that induces immune-tolerance to antigens injected into the eye´s anterior chamber, provoking the reduction of such immune response. In the light of this notion, induction of ACAID to neural constituents could be used as a potential prophylactic therapy to promote neuroprotection. In order to evaluate this approach, three experiments were performed. In the first one, the capability to induce ACAID of the spinal cord extract (SCE) and the myelin basic protein (MBP) was evaluated. Using the delayed type hypersensibility assay (DTH) we demonstrated that both, SCE and MBP were capable of inducing ACAID. In the second experiment we evaluated the effect of SCE-induced ACAID on neurological and morphological recovery after SCI. In the results, there was a significant improvement of motor recovery, nociceptive hypersensitivity and motoneuron survival in rats with SCE-induced ACAID. Moreover, ACAID also up-regulated the expression of genes encoding for anti-inflammatory cytokines and FoxP 3 but down-regulated those for pro-inflamatory cytokines. Finally, in the third experiment, the effect of a more simple and practical strategy was evaluated: MBP-induced ACAID, we also found significant neurological and morphological outcomes. In the present study we demonstrate that the induction of ACAID <b>against</b> <b>neural</b> antigens in rats, promotes neuroprotection after SCI...|$|R

40|$|A common {{analytical}} {{problem in}} neuroscience is {{the interpretation of}} neural activity with respect to sensory input or behavioral output. This is typically achieved by regressing measured <b>neural</b> activity <b>against</b> known stimuli or behavioral variables to produce a "tuning function" for each neuron. Unfortunately, because this approach handles neurons individually, it cannot take advantage of simultaneous measurements from spatially adjacent neurons that often have similar tuning properties. On the other hand, sharing information between adjacent neurons can errantly degrade estimates of tuning functions across space if there are sharp discontinuities in tuning between nearby neurons. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient block Gibbs sampler that effectively pools information between neurons to de-noise tuning function estimates while simultaneously preserving sharp discontinuities that might exist {{in the organization of}} tuning across space. This method is fully Bayesian and its computational cost per iteration scales sub-quadratically with total parameter dimensionality. We demonstrate the robustness and scalability of this approach by applying it to both real and synthetic datasets. In particular, an application to data from the spinal cord illustrates that the proposed methods can dramatically decrease the experimental time required to accurately estimate tuning functions...|$|R
