5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} Congress has {{authority}} {{separate and distinct}} from powers granted by enumeration was (and still is) controversial.

After leaving office, Schricker cofounded the Wabash Fire and Casualty Insurance Company of Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, Australia {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} vertical fiscal imbalances in the world: the states and territories collect just 18% of all governmental revenues but are responsible for almost 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> areas. Furthermore, the centralisation of revenue collection has allowed Canberra to force state policy in areas well beyond the scope of its constitutional powers, by using the grants power (s.96) to mandate the terms on which the states spend money in areas over which the it has no power (such as spending on education, health and policing).|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> cuts {{required by}} the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by {{reducing the amount of}} spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this plan will be an {{important}} part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} as the {{director}} of the OMB, Bush referred to him as [...] "the Blade," [...] for his noted acumen at budget cutting. The $2.13 trillion budget Daniels submitted to Congress in 2001 would have made deep cuts in many agencies to accommodate the tax cuts being made, but few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> cuts were actually approved by Congress. During Daniels' 29-month tenure in the position, the projected federal budget surplus of $236 billion declined to a $400 billion deficit, due to an economic downturn, and failure to enact spending cuts to offset the tax reductions.|$|E

Claiming that the SNP Government had passed on 89 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> cuts imposed by the UK Government, she compared the Nationalists to the businessman criticised {{for his role in}} the financial collapse of Glasgow Rangers Football Club, saying, [...] "Putting the SNP in charge of a council is like putting Craig Whyte in charge of your tax return." [...] Retaining control of Glasgow City Council, where Labour was facing a strong challenge from the SNP, was another of the party's key objectives. After the polls, political academic John Curtice, writing for The Guardian, observed that Lamont [...] "has undoubtedly done enough to dispel doubts about whether she was the right woman for the job".|$|E

500|$|The CBO {{reported}} in several studies that the ACA {{would reduce the}} deficit, and that repealing it would increase the deficit. The 2011 comprehensive CBO estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than $200 billion during the 2012–2021 period: it calculated the law would result in $604 billion in total outlays offset by $813 billion in total receipts, resulting in a $210 billion net deficit reduction. The CBO separately predicted that while most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> provisions do not begin until 2014, revenue would exceed spending in those subsequent years. The CBO claimed that the bill would [...] "substantially reduce the growth of Medicare's payment rates for most services; impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums; and make various other changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs"—ultimately extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 8 years.|$|E
500|$|Zahorchak {{served as}} acting {{education}} secretary from August 2004, when Phillips left the position, to September 2004, when Francis Barnes was hired. During the Barnes administration, Governor Ed Rendell encouraged local Pennsylvania school boards {{to participate in}} Act 72, a state property tax-relief program. Act 72 used proceeds from slot-machine gambling to finance property tax cuts from homeowners, and included with spending restrictions {{in exchange for the}} tax cuts. Barnes himself did not support the program, and most school boards rejected it because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> restrictions. Zahorchak, however voiced support for Act 72 and helped Rendell lobby local school districts to support it, which increased his visibility statewide. Zahorchak claimed Act 72 [...] "includes real property tax relief that shifts more of the responsibility for school funding back to the state". When Barnes resigned in September 2005, Zahorchak was again tapped to serve as acting secretary and was widely considered the most qualified candidate for the permanent position, although Governor Ed Rendell engaged in a thorough search for other potential candidates around the state.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{was written}} by Parks and Recreation co-creator, Michael Schur. It was his fifth writing credit for the series after, [...] "Pilot", [...] "Greg Pikitis", [...] "Christmas Scandal", and [...] "Galentine's Day". The idea of state {{auditors}} visiting Pawnee, and the subsequent government shutdown, was inspired by news reports {{at the time of}} a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession. In particular, Schur cited stories about Kansas City closing down several of their public schools, and Idaho threatening to shut down the state parks department. Similar measures were being discussed in such states as New York, New Jersey and California. This was in keeping with efforts by the Parks and Recreation writers to be more topical with second season episodes. Upon learning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spending</b> freeze, Ron and Leslie engage in heated arguments over the function of government, with Leslie insisting the government is meant to provide social services and Ron advocating as little government intervention as possible. Throughout most of the second season, much of the relationship between Leslie and Ron focused on the two developing a mutual respect for each other. However, with the introduction of the Ben Wyatt character and the conflict over budget problems in Pawnee, the writers included these arguments between Leslie and Ron to illustrate their conflicting political ideologies and develop tension amid the character and the city hall setting.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{spending}} power {{is to be}} limited only by Congress' notion of the general welfare, the reality, given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government, is that the Spending Clause gives [...] "power to the Congress {{to tear down the}} barriers, to invade the states' jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed."
