5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} <b>of</b> <b>jumping</b> events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority <b>of</b> <b>jumping</b> events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E

The natural space for that is the space D = D[0, 1] of cadlag real functions. We begin with limit theorems for ARMAD(1, 1) processes. It appears that under some conditions, the functional linear process and its innovation have the same jumps. This nice property allows us to focus on the case of i. i. d. D-valued random variables. For such variables, we estimate the intensity <b>of</b> <b>jumps</b> in various situations : fixed number <b>of</b> <b>jumps,</b> random instants <b>of</b> <b>jumps,</b> random number <b>of</b> instants <b>of</b> <b>jumps,</b> [...] We derive exponential rates and limits in distribution...|$|R

Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when {{competitions}} in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, mail coach driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types <b>of</b> <b>jumping</b> (high jump, long jump and show-jumping) were held. Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping.

40|$|Background: Several {{component}} is {{needed by the}} basketball players, {{one of them is}} lower extremity power that is closely related to the ability to jump. So that basketball players need to get exercises to improve jumping ability which is using core exercise and depth jump Objective: To determine the effect of core exercise on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players, the effect <b>of</b> depth <b>jump</b> on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players, and to determine the different effects of core exercise and depth jump on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players. Benefits: To increase the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players by using core exercise and depth jump. Method: Thetypeof research is quasi experiment with the two group pretest-posttest design. The number of samples in this study is 12. Samples are given the core exercise and depth jump for 8 weeks with a 2 times a week of exercise frequency. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test to test the influence and Mann-Whitney Test to test different influences. The height measuring tool is using the Vertical Jump Test leap. Results: After Wilcoxon Test, there is the effect of core exercise to the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> by p-value 0, 027. And so does the effect <b>of</b> depth <b>jump</b> after Wilcoxon test by the p-value 0, 027. There is a difference between the core exercise influence and depth <b>of</b> the high <b>jump</b> leap in basketball, after Mann-Whitney Test p-value of 0. 004 was obtained. Conclusion: There is the effect of core exercise on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players. There is the effect <b>of</b> depth <b>jump</b> on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players. There are different effect between giving core exercise and depth jump on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump</b> <b>of</b> basketball players, which the core exercise has the better effect on the height <b>of</b> the <b>jump.</b> Keywords: Basketball Players, The Height <b>of</b> The <b>Jump,</b> Core Exercise, Depth Jum...|$|R

5|$|Rainbow trout, chinook and coho salmon, and Pacific Lamprey are {{the most}} common {{anadromous}} fish that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>jumping</b> over the Butte Creek waterfall, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains largemouth bass and rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the intruder. If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack and kill the intruder. Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable <b>of</b> <b>jumping</b> several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out <b>of</b> <b>jumping,</b> distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

40|$|This paper models {{components}} of the return distribution, which {{are assumed to be}} directed by a latent news process. The conditional variance of returns is a combination <b>of</b> <b>jumps</b> and smoothly changing components. A heterogeneous Poisson process with a time-varying conditional intensity parameter governs the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>jumps.</b> Unlike typical jump models with stochastic volatility, previous realizations <b>of</b> both <b>jump</b> and normal innovations can feed back asymmetrically into expected volatility. This model improves forecasts of volatility, particularly after large changes in stock returns. We provide empirical evidence of the impact and feedback effects <b>of</b> <b>jump</b> versus normal return innovations, leverage effects, and the time-series dynamics <b>of</b> <b>jump</b> clustering. THERE IS A WIDE-SPREAD PERCEPTION in the financial press that volatility of asset returns has been changing. The new economy is introducing more uncertainty.
