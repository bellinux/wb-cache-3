If one was absent from the night service, the Bishop would take no notice till it was over; but when all the others were gone back to bed, he would wake the defaulter, and make him go through the service with no companion but himself, making the responses. They did not like him to put them out, as he often did on their journeys, while going through the Psalms, by dwelling on the [...] "prayer-verses;" [...] and most especially did they dislike his leading them to church, whatever season or weather it might be, to chant matins before it was light. Once, at Marlow, when it was a long way to church, very muddy, and with a cold rain falling, one of his clergy, in hopes of making him turn back, led him into the worst part of the swamp, where he sunk up to his knees in mud, and lost his shoe; but he took no notice until, after the service was over, he had returned to his lodgings, half dead with cold, and then, instead of expressing any anger, he only <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> to be made for the shoe.|$|E
6000|$|Five {{hundred years}} after his death, King Henry the Second, having heard from an ancient British bard that Arthur's body lay interred in the Abbey of Glastonbury, and that the spot was marked by some small pyramids erected near it, and that the body would {{be found in a}} rude coffin made of a {{hollowed}} oak, <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> to be made. The ballads and tales which had been then, for several centuries, circulating throughout England, narrating and praising King Arthur's exploits, had given him so wide a fame, that great interest was felt in the recovery and the identification of his remains. The searchers found the pyramids in the cemetery of the abbey. They dug between them, and came at length to a stone. Beneath this stone was a leaden cross, with the inscription in Latin, [...] "HERE LIES BURIED THE BODY OF GREAT KING ARTHUR." [...] Going down still below this, they came at length, at the depth of sixteen feet from the surface, to a great coffin, made of the trunk of an oak tree, and within it was a human skeleton of unusual size. The skull was very large, and showed marks of ten wounds. Nine of them were closed by concretions of the bone, indicating that the wounds by which those contusions or fractures had been made had been healed while life continued. The tenth fracture remained in a condition which showed that that had been the mortal wound.|$|E

During an hour-long re-enactment, with PC Helen Kay playing McLean's role, Tanner posed in the station cafe, strolled along the platform and replayed the final embrace and kiss they shared before he boarded the train. Pressed by reporters, Tanner stated: [...] "I did not kill her. I don't know what happened to her. In my heart of hearts I know she is still alive." [...] As a result of the reconstruction, two independent witnesses placed Tanner at the station but not McLean. At the beginning of May, police contacted Oxfordshire County Council for details regarding the layout of houses in Argyle Street, particularly about their basements. They were told that there were no basements in the houses, but an official remembered the houses were underpinned, which meant there were cavities under the floors.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{have been}} several {{evaluation}} mechanisms proposed for computing query answers based on the well-founded semantics, for programs with negation.

In this paper, we extend <b>Ordered</b> <b>Search</b> to compute the well-founded semantics for all (non-floundering) programs with negation.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> {{problem is}} to find a {{particular}} item in an ordered list of n items. Using the adversary method, Hoyer, Neerbek, and Shi proved a quantum lower bound for this problem of (1 /pi) ln n + Theta(1). Here, we find the exact value of the best possible quantum adversary lower bound for a symmetrized version of <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> (whose query complexity differs from that of the original problem by at most 1). Thus we show that the best lower bound for <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> that can be proved by the adversary method is (1 /pi) ln n + O(1). Furthermore, we show that this remains true for the generalized adversary method allowing negative weights. Comment: 13 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

By characterizing a class of quantum query algorithms for <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> in terms of a semidefinite program, we find new quantum algorithms for small instances of the <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> problem.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} into the genotypephenotype map in Position Independent Grammatical Evolution (?GE). Previous studies have shown ?GE to exhibit a performance increase over standard Grammatical Evolution (GE). The only difference between the two approaches is in how the genotype-phenotype mapping process is performed. GE uses a leftmost non terminal expansion, while ?GE evolves the order of mapping as well as the content. In this study, we use the idea of focused search to examine which aspect of the ?GE mapping process provides the lift in performance over standard GE by applying our approaches to three benchmark problems taken from specialised literature. We examined the traditional ?GE approach and compared it to two setups which examined the extremes of mapping <b>order</b> <b>search</b> and content search, and against setups with varying ratios of content and <b>order</b> <b>search.</b> In all of these tests a purely content focused ?GE was shown to exhibit a performance gain over the other setups...|$|R

On the empirical side, the model’s predictions are tested by studying four industries listed in the German and French printed yellow pages directories. The key assumption is that such a directory constitutes an alphabetically <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> market. It is found that in some of the included industries alphabetical ranking influences revenues, but this does hold for all the included industries.

40|$|This paper proves lower {{bounds of}} the quantum query {{complexity}} of a multiple-block <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> problem, {{which is a}} natural generalization of the <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> problems. Apart from much studied polynomial and adversary methods for quantum query complexity lower bounds, our proof employs an argument that (i) commences with the faulty assumption that a quantum algorithm of low query complexity exists, (ii) select any incompressible input, and (iii) constructs another algorithm that compresses the input, {{which leads to a}} contradiction. Using this ``algorithmic'' argument, we show that the multi-block <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> needs a large number of nonadaptive oracle queries on a black-box model of quantum computation supplemented by advice. This main theorem can be applied directly to two important notions in structural complexity theory: nonadaptive (truth-table) reducibility and autoreducibility. In particular, we prove: 1) there is an oracle A relative to which there is a set in P^A which is not quantumly nonadaptively reducible to A in polynomial time even with polynomial advice; 2) there is a polynomial-time adaptively probabilistically-autoreducible set which is not polynomial-time nonadaptively quantum-autoreducible even with any help of polynomial advice, and; 3) there is a set in ESPACE which is not polynomial-time nonadaptively quantum-autoreducible in polynomial time even in the presence of polynomial advice. For the single-block <b>ordered</b> <b>search</b> problem, our algorithmic argument also shows a large lower bound of the quantum query complexity in the presence of advice...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the quantum {{complexities of the}} following three problems: <b>searching</b> an <b>ordered</b> list, sorting an un-ordered list, and deciding whether the numbers in a list are all distinct. Letting N be the number of elements in the input list, we prove a lower bound of 1 π (ln(N) − 1) accesses to the list elements for <b>ordered</b> <b>searching,</b> a lower bound of Ω(N log N) binary comparisons for sorting, and a lower bound of Ω (√ N log N) binary comparisons for element distinctness. The previously best known lower bounds are 1 12 log 2 (N) − O(1) due to Ambainis, Ω(N), and Ω (√ N), respectively. Our proofs {{are based on a}} weighted all-pairs inner product argument. In addition to our lower bound results, we give a quantum algorithm for <b>ordered</b> <b>searching</b> using roughly 0. 631 log 2 (N) oracle accesses. Our algorithm uses a quantum routine for traversing through a binary search tree faster than classically, and it is of a nature very different from a faster algorithm due to Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser. ...|$|R
