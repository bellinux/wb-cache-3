50|$|At the 1938 Conference of the Pan-American States, held in Lima, Peru, the US {{delegation}} introduced two resolutions. The first, {{which was}} actually aimed at wresting control of CIM from Doris Stevens, proposed reorganizing the Inter-American Commission of Women, making it permanent and giving each government {{the means to}} appoint their own “official” representative. Disregarding the other delegates’ lack of support, the Roosevelt administration maintained that Stevens was not an official US representative {{as she had been}} appointed by the Pan-American Union and appointed Mary Nelson Winslow of the US Department of Labor’s Women’s Bureau as their delegate. Ultimately, the US initiative was adopted and the CIM was fully reorganized between 1938 and 1940 as a subsidiary commission of the Pan-American Union. It lost its autonomy becoming an official governmental entity bound by state aims, but gained <b>official</b> <b>financing</b> and <b>support.</b>|$|R

To address critical information gaps, we {{introduce a new}} open source methodology for collecting project-level development finance information and create a database of Chinese <b>official</b> <b>finance</b> to Africa from 2000 - 2011.

40|$|The emerging-market {{crises of}} the 1990 s were {{characterized}} by crashes in exchange rates, credit flows, and output, and the currency crashes caused the other two. Because local banks and firms had large foreign-currency debts, the sharp depreciations of their countries' currencies had huge balance-sheet effects that led to an implosion of domestic credit flows, causing sharp falls in investment and output. It is wrong to blame the IMF for these calamitous outcomes. Nevertheless, the strategy adopted by the IMF {{for dealing with the}} Asian crisis was partly responsible for the severity of the crisis. By calling for extensive structural reforms, it delayed the restoration of investor confidence by causing investors to believe that recovery could not occur until the reforms were implemented. And though it assembled huge amounts of official funding, it made far less funding available up front [...] too little to arrest the collapse of the Asian currencies. In future, the international community must rely less heavily on massive <b>official</b> <b>financing</b> and seek instead to achieve the rapid restructuring of external debt, including private-sector debt.

40|$|How big is China’s aid to Africa? Does it {{complement}} or {{undermine the}} efforts of traditional donors? China releases little information, and outside estimates of the size and nature of Chinese aid vary widely. In an effort to overcome this problem, AidData, based at the College of William and Mary, has compiled a database of thousands of media reports on Chinese-backed projects in Africa from 2000 to 2011. The database includes information on 1, 673 projects in 50 African countries and on $ 75 billion in commitments of <b>official</b> <b>finance.</b> This paper describes the new database methodology, key findings, and possible applications of the data, which is being made publicly available for the first time. The paper and database offer a new tool set for researchers, policymakers, journalists, and civil-society organizations working to understand China’s growing role in Africa. The paper also discusses the challenges of quantifying Chinese development activities, introduces AidData’s Media-Based Data Collection (MBDC) methodology, {{provides an overview of}} Chinese development finance in Africa as tracked by this new database, and discusses the potential and limitations of MBDC as a resource for tracking development finance.
