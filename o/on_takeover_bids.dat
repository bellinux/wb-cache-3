40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the European Directive <b>on</b> <b>Takeover</b> <b>Bids,</b> a European common legal framework governs regulation of takeovers in EU Members States. The European Directive <b>on</b> <b>Takeover</b> <b>Bids</b> was adopted in April 2004, and implemented in the UK and in other Member States on 20 th May 2006. The Directive seeks to regulate takeovers by way of protecting investors, and harmonising takeover laws in Europe. In facilitating the restructuring of companies through takeovers, the Directive aims at reinforcing the free movement of capital. Takeovers and the European Legal Framework studies the European Community Directive <b>on</b> <b>Takeover</b> <b>Bids,</b> in order to provide greater understanding of both the impact and effect of the European legal framework of takeover regulation. It firstly looks at the Directive from a British perspective, focusing on the impact of the transposition of the Takeover Directive into the UK. The book examines the provisions of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, and discusses the takeover provisions in the Companies Act 2006 that implement the Takeover Directive in the UK, arguing that the Directive will provide a new basis for UK takeover regulation, and that the system will work well. Jonathan Mukwiri goes on to consider the Directive in relation to the EU, arguing that despite its deficiencies, in that Member States are free to opt to restrict takeovers, the Directive provides a useful legal framework by which takeovers are regulated in different jurisdictions. Mukwiri highlights how the freedoms of the EC Treaty and EU Directives interact, and the effects of the Takeover Directive on political considerations in the law-making process in European Community. Moreover, he argues that the future of EU takeover regulation is likely to follow the lead of the UK, making this book relevant {{to a wide range of}} policy makers and academics across Europe...|$|E

The main issues identified and discussed in this paper include, in particular: (i) the absence of a fixed threshold of the share in the voting rights of a target company giving rise to an obligation to make a mandatory takeover bid; (ii) rules for the calculation of the mandatory takeover bid price that enable an interpretation under which (a) the price for the acquisition of the controlling stake of shares that triggers the obligation to make the mandatory takeover bid; or (b) the transactions with shares of the target company executed between the date on which the mandatory takeover bid obligation has arisen and the date of the publication of the takeover bid; must not be reflected in the offer price; (iii) the absence of an accurate specification of the moment as of which the obligation [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Cash- and stock-financed <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> induce strikingly {{different}} target revaluations. We exploit {{detailed data}} <b>on</b> unsuccessful <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> between 1980 and 2008, and {{we show that}} targets of cash offers are revalued on average by + 15 % after deal failure, whereas stock targets return to their pre-announcement levels. The differences in revaluation do not revert over longer horizons. We find no evidence that future takeover activities or operational changes explain these differences. While the targets of failed cash and stock offers are both {{more likely to be}} acquired over the following eight years than matched control firms, no differences exist between cash and stock targets, neither in the timing nor in the value of future offers. Similarly, we cannot detect differential operational policies following the failed bid. Our results are most consistent with cash bids revealing prior undervaluation of the target. We reconcile our findings with the opposite conclusion in earlier literature (Bradley, Desai, and Kim, 1983) by identifying a look-ahead bias built into their sample construction.

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{cross-border}} takeover activity in the EU over the past years. This is fortunate since the Commission views the increase of such activity and the ensuing restructuring of firms as vital to implement its aim of making Europe the most competitive economy by 2010. The Commission is concerned, however, by the fact that most Member States still have legal, cultural, or other structures, which either impede or reduce the occurrence of takeovers. The Commission is also concerned that the level of protection afforded to offeree shareholders in the context of takeovers differs from one Member State to another. Indeed, the offeree shareholders in some Member States enjoy a far better protection than their counterparts in other Member States. This thesis analyses these two aspects of takeover regulation from the point of view of the UK and France. The latter countries have had a significant impact upon the drafting of the Directive <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids,</b> as well as of numerous individual European countries' takeover regulations, due to their solid experience with national takeover regulation. It is therefore believed that the comparative analysis of the takeover regimes of these two jurisdictions will offer a better understanding of both the Directive <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> and other European countries' takeover regulations. Such comparative analysis is further believed to offer an insight into how the level of growth of a particular market and the different ownership structures impact upon the rules governing takeovers. This thesis begins by explaining the regulatory framework of takeovers in the UK and France as well as the ownership structures prevailing in these two jurisdictions. It subsequently analyses in a comparative manner the role of the offeree management and the equality of shareholders in these two countries. This thesis concludes with the gradual convergence of takeover regulations in the UK and France and throughout Europe more generally...|$|E
40|$|Focusing <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> whose outcome can be {{predicted}} in advance with certainty, Grossman and Hart established the proposition, which subsequent work accepted, that successful bids {{must be made}} {{at or above the}} expected value of minority shares. This proposition provided the basis for Grossman and Hart's identification of a free-rider problem and became a major premise for the analysis of takeovers This paper shows that this important proposition does not always hold once we drop the assumption that the only successful bids are those whose success could have been predicted with certainty In particular, it is shown that any unconditional bid that is below the expected value of minority shares but above the independent target's per share value will succeed with a certain positive probability, that the bidder's expected payoff from such a bid (not counting the transaction costs of making the bid) is always positive; and that bidders might elect to make such bids. These results have implications for the nature of the free-rider problem and for the operation of takeovers; in particular, it is shown that, when a raider can increase the value of a target's assets, the raider might elect to bid even if no dilution of minority shares is possible and it holds no initial stake in the target...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{critically}} analyse the evolution of the Romanian directors’ duties under the reign of the neutrality rule instated by the European Directive 2004 / 25 /EC <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids.</b> The issue of the takeover relevant directors’ duties has not been specifically and critically addressed in Romania. We reach the conclusion that due to similarities between the American and Romanian directors’ fiduciary duties and considering that the Romanian capital market is an area that is heading towards further development, the natural progression of the duties of directors of the companies present on the Bucharest Stock Exchange should follow the organic evolution of their American counterparts. This development is, however, artificially altered by the European neutrality rule. As shown above, the protection of Romanian minority shareholders is deficient under the European rule and the interests of Romanian companies and their shareholders may be affected by the application of the neutrality rule. Furthermore, the European Directive 2004 / 25 /EC creates a disadvantage for European companies compared to their non-European equivalents, primarily in regard to U. S. companies. For these reasons we conclude that it is necessary de lege ferenda to diminish the application of the neutrality rule at least in Romania's case. This initiative should be accompanied by a reconsideration of Romanian directors’ duties in hostile takeover through the lens of their American counterparts’ position, the next stage in the evolution of the legal and economic field, as mentioned above...|$|E

40|$|In its White Paper Program {{advocating the}} removal of all {{remaining}} internal barriers in the Common Market by 1992, the Commission for the European Communities (2 ̆ 2 Commission 2 ̆ 2) expressed a need for harmonizing {{the laws of the}} Member States <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> and announced that it would be bringing forward a proposal for a directive on this subject.

40|$|It is {{too early}} to make a {{complete}} judgment on the effectiveness of Directive 2004 / 25 /EC <b>on</b> <b>Takeover</b> <b>Bids</b> as a regulatory mechanism. Such a decision would involve determining whether the Directive: achieves its goals, secures high levels of compliance from Member States and market participants and is democratically accountable. However, this paper places the Directive under a regulatory microscope in order to reflect upon some of its potential strengths and failings in respect of these criteria. A central regulatory problem for European legislators involved determining the optimal balance between harmonization and diversity. In an attempt to reach agreement between Member States, a framework Directive was agreed laying down minimum standards for takeover regulation and a number of key provisions were made optional. On the one hand, it is argued that even this 2 ̆ 2 light regulatory touch 2 ̆ 2 may have jeopardised the existing efficient self-regulatory regime which operates in the UK, the largest European takeover market. On the other hand, by allowing Member States a significant degree of discretion in implementing the Directive, problems of interpretation and classification arise (is the Directive a company law directive or a capital markets directive?), regulatory gaps may be identified, national differences emerge and the achievement of the Directive 2 ̆ 7 s goal of facilitating takeovers and yielding a level playing field may be thwarted. In respect of the latter, the paper focuses on the restrictions on frustrating action and the breakthrough rule. Finally, the paper seeks to determine whether, in this context, competition is preferable to harmonisation. It was hoped that by setting down benchmarks the Directive might 2 ̆ 2 put a floor to the race to the bottom. 2 ̆ 2 Unfortunately, it is argued that the picture post-implementation does not support this contention...|$|E
40|$|Although {{most studies}} proves that Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (C-B M&A) cause more {{benefits}} than threats, the real economic {{policy in the}} EU countries offsets the fear that liberalization of inward C-B M&A would endanger economic position of strategic industries and thus national economic goals. After the adoption of EU Directive 2004 / 25 /EC <b>on</b> <b>Takeover</b> <b>Bids</b> the era of fast growth of inward C-B M&A in the EU and consequently the era of rising interventionism so as to protect national strategic industries and companies has started. Additional stimulus for the European Union’s (EU) most developed economies to exercise interventionism was financial and economic crisis starting in 2008. Considering high ranking of employment goals and state-supported social cohesion in continental Europe, it is not surprise that interventionist reactions came from ruling parties and coalitions regardless their political orientation.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a model of}} policy preference formation in legislative politics. Emphasizing a dynamic relationship between structure, agent, and decision-making process, it ties the question of policy choice to the dimensionality of the normative and cognitive political space and the strategic actions of parliamentary agenda setters. The model proposes that structural factors, such as ideology, shape policy preferences {{to the extent that}} legislative actors successfully link them to specific policy proposals through the strategic provision of focal points. These ideas or images shift attention toward particular aspects of a legislative proposal, thus shaping the dominant interpretation of its content and consequences. This interpretation affects both individual-level policy preferences and policy outcomes.

40|$|The main {{theories}} of European economic integration argue that private economic interests {{play an important}} role in the integration process. This role is a positive one, whereby economic interests provide the impetus and pressures for integration to move forward. Public policy analyses of the European Union’s legislative process, however, show that intense lobbying by such interests can prevent legislative proposals from being adopted, even if these economic interests were initially in favour of supranational legislation in the given policy area. So how is it possible that economic interests may initially be favourable to integration in a given policy area but then end up rejecting legislative proposals made by the Commission, usually by intensely lobbying the European Parliament and/or the Council of Ministers? The answer is based on the idea that economic interests initially face great uncertainty as to the precise costs and benefits of integrating a particular policy area. Only once the ‘fog of integration’ lifts – as a result of concrete legislative proposals being tabled by the Commission – are economic interests able to calculate these costs and benefits and, consequently, decide whether to lobby for or against the proposal. To provide a first run at validating the argument, the paper examines two cases of integration failure in the EU: the directive on patenting computer-implemented inventions (‘Software Patent Directive’) and the directive <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> (‘Takeover Directive’). These cases not only indicate that the argument is valid but they also suggest that integration failure can take different forms depending on how economic interest polarize on a given policy issue. This leads us to conclude that regional integration scholars would benefit from integrating the lessons learned from the studies of EU politics and policy-making into their models of European integration...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to derive {{implications}} for merger and acquisition (M&A) policy by specifically analyzing the background of the reorganization of Europe's power and gas industries, which was accomplished through means such as cross-border M&As and grasping the reorganization mechanism under the framework of multiple games involving three kinds of players: firms, sovereign states, and international organizations; that act in accordance with their own respective principles. In recent years, many attempts to reorganize Europe's power and gas industries have relied on cross-border M&As, in addition to other means. The factors behind these efforts can be summarized as follows: - Institutional factors: The establishment of an institutional environment that is conducive to M&A activity. For instance, in line with the European Union's basic principle of free capital movement, anti-takeover rules have been clarified across Europe with EU member states adopting the EU directive <b>on</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> into domestic legislation. - Business environment factors: Specific to the power and gas industries, there has been an increasing number of policy initiatives designed to create an integrated European market under the philosophy of "sustainable, competitive, and secure energy supply. " Cross-border M&As have been identified as an effective strategy to respond to such changes in the business environment. - Macroeconomic factors: Amid continuing economic growth in Europe, ample liquidity has enabled companies to raise capital, on favorable terms, necessary to fund large-scale M&As, which have been the vehicle of choice for implementing corporate strategy focused on expanding the earnings base. Against this background, E. ON AG, a German power utility, launched a high-profile takeover battle for the Spanish electricity company Endesa in February 2006. The takeover drama, which also involved a series of other players including competing bidders such as ENEL of Italy, the Spanish government, and the European Commission; ultimately ended when E. ON gave up its bid for Endesa in exchange for acquiring key infrastructure assets in Spain. The E. ON-Endesa takeover battle was subsequently analyzed by applying the framework of multiple games, which yielded the following implications: - National interests pursued by a sovereign state, profits pursued by a firm, and universal interests pursued by an international organization all have different values based on different principles, and economic globalization is a non-characteristic function form game. The reconciliation of different values is a political (democratic) decision-making process that is a meta-decision-making process in which no unambiguous right answer exists. The specific point {{that needs to be addressed}} is the reality of national interests that is judged against specific circumstances. Conditions imposed by the Spanish government on the takeover of Endesa by E. ON can be evaluated positively as a model solution that takes into consideration the reality of specific national interests. Thus, the range of applicability of the ruling handed down by the European Court of Justice that found the Spanish government's conditioning illegal should be viewed with some reservation. - Sufficient information disclosure is a prerequisite for executing an M&A that would produce the best results and be beneficial for both the acquirer and target company. A hostile TOB may impose significant burdens on both the acquirer and the target, while a compromise to find win-win solutions tends to bring realistic and desirable results. Powerful anti-takeover measures tend to produce greater adverse effects, and conditions for the adoption and use of such measures must be carefully examined. Future points to consider: - The reconciliation of the different values pursued by the sovereign state, firms, and international organization involved in a cross-border M&A is made in multilayered institutional settings: 1) foreign capital restrictions and other regulations at the sovereign state level; 2) antitakeover measures at an individual firm level; and 3) adjustments at an international level (e. g., region-wide competitive policy in the case of the EU). However, no established consensus exists on what constitutes a desirable institutional system for reconciliation. Institutions differ from one another in terms of regulatory grounds and degree of flexibility. Also, institutions can be classified among various types in terms of how anti-takeover measures at the firm level relate to foreign capital restrictions imposed at the sovereign state level. It is necessary to further examine these realities and reflect the findings in the design of future institutions. - Specifically with respect to the energy sector, foreign capital and the issue of how it should be defined and incorporated in designing institutions must be examined with due consideration to the need to ensure energy security. For that, insight from a broader perspective is necessary for answering questions related to capital relationship and energy security. ...|$|E
