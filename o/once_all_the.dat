5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex, or even a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The systematics (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer <b>once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> species have been described.|$|E
5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 <b>once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> signs were removed. The justification for the removal was that people were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a {{transfer}} student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon.

5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers <b>once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> agreed changes have been made. These will {{take the form of a}} £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned changes have been implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{joined the}} Home Fleet {{off the coast}} of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the {{following}} days. She refuelled at Tromsø on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, Furious returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at Bardufoss was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow <b>once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Gladiators had been flown off.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. <b>Once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

5|$|Metroid II is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran on the fictional planet SR388. In this side-scroller, players advance through the game by using Samus' weapons to kill a fixed number of Metroid creatures. The player is given a detector that displays the number of Metroids remaining in the area. <b>Once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> creatures are eliminated, an earthquake occurs and the planet's lava levels decrease, allowing Samus to travel deeper through its tunnels. The Metroid creatures are encountered in different evolution stages of their development cycle: original, Alpha, Gamma, Zeta and Omega. The more developed the organism is, the stronger its attack. Metroid II features save modules located around the planet, which allow players to save their progress and continue in another session.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> tissue {{compartments}} {{have reached}} saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per {{racetrack}} for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack. Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit was a young woman, a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it {{was conducted on the}} XA calutron and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack, and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required <b>once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 25,000 in mid-1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. <b>Once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
5|$|The Third Fleet sailed from Ulithi on 30 December 1944. On 3 and 4 January its {{aircraft}} carriers struck Japanese airfields on Formosa, Okinawa and nearby islands {{in an attempt}} to prevent them from being used to attack the Allied forces at Lingayen Gulf. In addition, its strike aircraft attacked Japanese shipping at Formosa, sinking at least three merchant vessels and damaging four frigates. Acting on a request from General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the South West Pacific Area, the fleet struck airfields on Luzon on 6 and 7 January. At around this time Vice-Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of the Seventh Fleet which was responsible for the Lingayen Gulf landings, asked Halsey to operate west of Luzon to provide air cover during the initial period of the invasion. Halsey did not believe that it was appropriate for his force to operate in such a passive role, and instead ordered further strikes on the Japanese airfields in southern Formosa which posed the greatest threat to Kinkaid's command. These took place on 9 January. During the morning of 9 January, Nimitz released the Third Fleet from directly covering the Lingayen Gulf area, and authorized it to enter the South China Sea. <b>Once</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> strike aircraft had landed that afternoon Halsey issued orders to execute the planned attack into the South China Sea. During the fleet's operations from 3 to 9 January it destroyed more than 150 Japanese aircraft, but lost 86 of its own, including 46 in accidents.|$|E
