5000|$|Gas {{operation}} {{is a system}} of operation used to provide energy to semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms. In gas-operation, a portion of high pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is tapped {{through a hole in}} the barrel and diverted to operate the action. There are three basic types: long stroke gas piston (where the gas piston goes the same distance as the <b>operating</b> <b>stroke</b> of the action parts, and is often attached to the action parts), short stroke gas piston (where the gas piston travels a shorter distance than the <b>operating</b> <b>stroke</b> of the action parts), and direct impingement (AKA [...] "direct gas", [...] "gas impingement", where there is no piston, and the gas acts directly on the action parts). A fourth type, now considered obsolete and ineffective, are those systems based on the Bang rifle that utilize a muzzle cap to capture gas after the bullet has left the barrel. While this system is successful in boosting the operating power of recoil operated guns, it is insufficient and too susceptible to fouling for use as the primary operating system.|$|E

40|$|The Stroke Minimization {{algorithm}} {{developed at}} the Princeton High Contrast Imaging Laboratory has proven symmetric dark hole generation using minimal stroke on two deformable mirrors (DM) in series. The windowed approach to Stroke Minimization has proven symmetric dark holes over small bandwidths by using three wavelengths to define the bandwidth of correction in the optimization problem. We address the relationship of amplitude and phase aberrations with wavelength, how this changes with multiple DMs, and the implications for simultaneously correcting both to achieve symmetric dark holes. <b>Operating</b> <b>Stroke</b> Minimization in the windowed configuration requires multiple wavelength estimates. To save on exposures, a single estimate is extrapolated to bounding wavelengths using the established relationship in wavelength to produce multiple estimates of the image plane electric field. Here we demonstrate better performance by improving this extrapolation of the estimate to other wavelengths. The accuracy of the functional relationship will ultimately bound the achievable bandwidth, therefore as a metric these results are also compared to estimating each wavelength separately. In addition to these algorithm improvements, we also discuss a laboratory upgrade {{and how it can}} better simulate broadband starlight. We also discuss the possibility of leveraging two DMs in series to directly estimate the electric field over a narrow bandwidth and the challenges associated with it.

40|$|Smooth plowing {{with the}} help of {{reversible}} plows has replaced an enclosure method of soil treatment. The method may cause a formation of back ridges or open furrows. Due to this fact turnings of a tractor unit with a minimum radius required in order to ensure shuttle movements each time in the furrow of the preceding <b>operating</b> <b>stroke</b> have become a dominant type of turnings. Non-productive shift time is directly dependent on them and it is on the average 10 – 12 %, and it is up to 40 % in small contour areas with short run. Large non-productive time is connected with the desire to reduce headland width at field edges, and then a turning is made in several stages while using a complicated maneuvering. Therefore, an increase in efficiency of a plowing unit by means of minimization on its turning radius and execution of turning at one stage in the shortest possible time are considered as relevant objectives. In such a case it is necessary {{to take into account the}} fact that potential capabilities of universal tractors having established time-proved designs in respect of reduction of turning radius are practically at the end. So it is expedient to solve the matter at the expense of additional removable devices that ensure transformation of tractor wheel formula at the run end in order to reorient its position. Finally high quality plowing ensured by future-oriented reversible plows will be accompanied not only by output increase per shift, but also by decrease in headland width, their compaction and abrasion due to suspension systems and increase in productivity. The developed design having a novelty which proved by an invention patent and representing an additional supporting and maneuvering device significantly minimizes all the above-mentioned disadvantages and does not require any changes in tractor production design. Investigations have been carried on the following topic: “Minimization of turning radius for universal tractors by transformation of wheel formula”. The paper presents a mathematical model, which reflects all the parameters having an effect on a tractor unit with a supporting and maneuvering device and it also considers a longitudinal and transverse stability. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper reveals one of {{possible}} methods for higher productivity {{and reliability of}} building self-propelled pneumopunchers which are intended for making holes in soil while using trenchless method and constructing various engineering communications under car, tram and rail lines, airport runways. A new design of building pneumopuncher with increased productivity due to higher speed for hole formation in soil and its reliability has been presented in the paper. A formula for determination of displacement increment for a new pneumopuncher {{in comparison with the}} conventional one has been obtained in the paper. The paper describes a design and operation principal of the building self-propelled pneumopuncher which is equipped with a locking mechanism with the purpose to neutralize action of soil elastic forces and reactive repulsive force. The locking mechanism keeps the pneumopuncher in the hole. The pneumopuncher consists of a body with anvil, movable hammer, a manifold which is set in axial deepening of the hammer, a nut and a locking mechanism. Improvement of operational pneumopuncher reliability is attained {{due to the fact that}} the locking mechanism is made in the form of two coaxially positioned inner and outer cups having a common basis. A piston is installed in the middle of the inner cup, a spring is fixed over the piston and a rod with a breaking shoe is positioned at the end. Height of the inner cup is less the outer cup height and there is an annular cavity between them which is connected with a chamber. The chamber is formed by the piston, the inner cup and the manifold. The annular cavity through an opening in the inner cup wall, two sylphons, a channel in the nut end and an opening in the vertical wall of the manifold are connected with a chamber of <b>operating</b> <b>stroke.</b> The sylphons are placed between the outer cup and the nut, between the nut and the manifold.

40|$|Purpose: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} psychometric properties of outcome measures used in stroke self-management interventions (SMIs) to (1) inform researchers, clinicians and commissioners about the properties of the measures in use and (2) make recommendations for the future development of self-management measurement in stroke. Methods: Electronic databases, government websites, generic internet search engines and hand searches of reference lists. Abstracts were selected against inclusion criteria and retrieved for appraisal and systematically scored, using the COSMIN checklist. Results: Thirteen studies of stroke self-management originating from six countries were identified. Forty-three different measures (mean 5. 08 /study, SD 2. 19) were adopted to evaluate self-SMIs. No studies measured self-management as a discreet concept. Six (46 %) studies included untested measures. Eleven (85 %) studies included at least one measure without reported reliability and validity in stroke populations. Conclusions: The use of outcome measures which are related, indirect or proxy indicators of self-management and that have questionable reliability and validity, contributes to an inability to sensitively evaluate the effectiveness of stroke self-SMIs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ischemia-induced {{cutaneous}} anesthesia of {{the healthy}} hand {{in patients with}} chronic stroke elicits transient improvements of motor performance in the contralateral, paretic hand. OBJECTIVE: The present {{study was designed to}} investigate one of the possible mechanisms underlying this effect. METHODS: The authors evaluated the effects of transient ischemic cutaneous anesthesia of the healthy hand (target intervention) and healthy foot (control intervention) on transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional onto the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M 1). Ten subjects with chronic, predominantly subcortical stroke with motor impairment were assessed. RESULTS: Cutaneous anesthesia of the intact hand but not the intact leg resulted in reduction of the inhibitory drive from the contralesional to the ipsilesional M 1 both at rest and immediately preceding movements of the paretic hand. Changes in premovement interhemispheric inhibition showed a trend for correlation with improvements in finger-tapping speed in the paretic hand. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that modulation of interhemispheric inhibitory interactions between the contralesional and ipsilesional M 1, either primarily or secondary to intrahemispheric excitability changes in either hemisphere, may contribute to performance improvements with cutaneous anesthesia of the intact hand. The present study provides additional insight into the mechanisms by which rehabilitative interventions focused on training one hand and restraining the other may <b>operate</b> after chronic <b>stroke...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{thermal model}} for an electro-thermal-compliant (ETC) microactuator {{is presented in}} this paper. The model accounts for all modes of heat dissipation and the temperature dependence of thermophysical and heat transfer properties. The thermal modelling technique underlying the microactuator model is general {{and can be used}} for the virtual testing of any ETC device over a wide range of temperatures (300 – 1500 K). The influence of physical size and thermal boundary conditions at the anchors, where the device is connected to the substrate, on the behaviour of an ETC microactuator is studied by finite element simulations based on the comprehensive thermal model. Simulations show that the performance ratio of the microactuator increased by two orders of magnitude when the characteristic length of the device was increased by one order of magnitude from 0. 22 to 2. 2 mm. Restricting heat loss to the substrate via the device anchors increased the actuator stroke by 66 % and its energy efficiency by 400 %, on average, over the temperature range of 300 – 1500 K. An important observation made is that the size of the device and thermal boundary conditions at the device anchor primarily control the <b>stroke,</b> <b>operating</b> temperature and performance ratio of the microactuator for a given electrical conductivity.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a refrigerator is largely guided by the efficiency of its drive unit, namely, the compressor 2 ̆ 6 understanding the compressor behavior requires a detailed study of its dynamics, flow-thermals, electrical and controls aspects. Having a simulation model which captures these physics reasonably well is {{a critical part of}} the design and performance prediction of a compressor. The current paper describes a systematic approach of making a system level simulation framework by first developing individual models and then integrating them into a single framework to capture the multi-physics interaction of the different sub-components. This framework, developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK contains five modules, namely, Dynamics, Thermal, Motor, Controls and Post-processor. Dynamics is modeled as a spring-mass system with adjustable static equilibrium and head-crash prevention algorithm. The thermodynamics model essentially captures the valve physics. The valves in a reciprocating compressor contribute to pressure losses (pressure profile deviation from ideal suction 2 ̆ 6 discharge processes, valve dynamics, leakages, pressure pulsations) and thermal losses (refrigerant back-flow caused by incorrect valve timing). The starting point of simulating these details is considering the gas dynamics and coupling it to the valve motion. The prediction of this model is validated against test data of a baseline compressor. As part of the integrated design framework, a permanent magnet motor is simulated as a resistance-inductance network with a series, velocity dependent voltage.

50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the swash plate angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash plate angle to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash plate angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will <b>operate</b> at full <b>stroke.</b> This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|R

Objective: To examine the role of carotid plaque rupture and thrombosis in ischemic stroke pathogenesis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, excluding those with possible cardiac embolization or with severe stenosis of the circle of Willis. Design, Setting, and Patients: A total of 269 carotid plaques selected from an Interinstitutional Carotid Tissue Bank were studied by histology after surgical endarterectomy between January 1995 and December 2002. A total of 96 plaques were from patients with ipsilateral major stroke, 91 plaques from patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA), and 82 plaques from patients without symptoms. Main Outcome Measures: Differences {{in the frequency of}} thrombosis, cap rupture, cap erosion, inflammatory infiltrate, and major cardiovascular risk factors between study groups. Results: A thrombotically active carotid plaque associated with high inflammatory infiltrate was observed in 71 (74. 0 %) of 96 patients with ipsilateral major stroke (and in all 32 plaques from patients operated within 2 months of symptom onset) compared with 32 (35. 2 %) of 91 patients with TIA (P<. 001) or 12 (14. 6 %) of 82 patients who were without symptoms (P<. 001). In addition, a fresh thrombus was observed in 53. 8 % of patients with <b>stroke</b> <b>operated</b> 13 to 24 months after the cerebrovascular event. An acute thrombus was associated with cap rupture in 64 (90. 1 %) of 71 thrombosed plaques from patients with stroke and with cap erosion in the remaining 7 cases (9. 9 %). Ruptured plaques of patients affected by stroke were characterized by the presence of a more severe inflammatory infiltrate, constituted by monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocyte cells compared with that observed in the TIA and asymptomatic groups (P=. 001).

Conclusion: These results demonstrate a major role of carotid thrombosis and inflammation in ischemic stroke in patients affected by carotid atherosclerotic disease...|$|R
40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA), a common upper airway (UA) {{respiratory}} sleep disorder, {{is considered one}} of the most threatening diseases to quality of life worldwide. OSA occurs due to obstruction in the UA region, and is characterized by repeated collapse and/or obstruction of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. UA collapse occurs when the airway muscle forces are less than those generated from the airway negative pressures during respiration. The collapse may occur at the nasopharynx, oropharynx, or hypopharynx; but it is more likely to occur at the rear of the uvula (during expiration) and rear of the tongue (during inspiration). OSA can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, low sexual drive in males, atherosclerosis, and increased rate of sudden death. Treatment of this ailment can be achieved invasively and non-invasively. Bariatric surgery is one of the invasive treatment modalities that has been used for many years for weight reduction and consequently alleviate OSA symptoms in morbid obese patients, but no biomechanical assessment for the UA characteristics and OSA symptoms before and after the surgery has been yet conducted. For many years, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been proven to be the golden and the first line non-invasive treatment for patients with moderate to severe OSA, mainly due to its non-invasive nature. There are many side effects of CPAP including dry nose, nasal congestion (itching or rhinorrhea), and it has been reported that due to its high <b>operating</b> pressure, <b>stroke</b> symptoms were recorded for cardiovascular disease patients. Respiratory devices that use pressure oscillations (PO) have been proven to have better respiratory outcomes in both animal and human models. PO have resulted in increasing both the activity and the stiffness of the UA muscles in both anesthetized and tracheotomised sleeping dogs, which in turn increased the UA patency and reduced its collapsibility. It has been reported that in sleeping humans, muscles in the UA increase their activity in response to high-frequency-low-amplitude pressure oscillations applied through the nasal airway. This electromyographic response was observed in both normal subjects and patients with OSA. From these results, it is clear that the PO can change the activity of the UA muscles, and consequently affect the surface tension, the airway compliance, and the airway collapsibility. Our hypothesis is that the PO superimposed on CPAP will reduce the required mean pressure to keep the airway open during sleep, and will reduce the risk of high pressure using the conventional CPAP. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the biomechanical changes and/or improvements in the UA characteristics before and after the invasive bariatric surgery in morbid obese OSA patients; and with the non-invasive CPAP superimposed with the PO, specifically we attempt to improve understanding of the effects of the PO on the UA respiratory system, which will lead to a more controlled method of delivering the PO in respiratory devices by determining the frequencies and amplitudes that optimise the breathing variables. Moreover, it will keep the airway open in OSA patients at a much lower CPAP than currently used, which will in turn increase the patient’s comfort. Bariatric surgery resulted in completely resolving OSA symptoms in morbid obese middle aged patients diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA. Also the use of the PO succeeded in keeping the airway open with no sign of collapse at much lower pressure distributions than the obtained values when using the conventional CPAP alone to prevent the occurrence of the apneic events...|$|R
40|$|Background Stroke is {{the most}} {{frequent}} neurological disorder and {{the second most common}} cause of death worldwide. With approximately eighty percent, cerebral ischemia represents the most abundant type of this disease. Apart from physical disability, surviving patients often suffer from weight loss accompanied by a reduction of muscular mass. This wastage {{is not limited to the}} affected side of the body and furthermore contributes to a decreased life quality among the patients concerned. There is a lack of research on the specific causes or potential therapeutic approaches for weight loss after stroke, although both human and veterinary clinical studies identified loss in weight as a negative factor for stroke outcome. Purpose The aim of the present study was the investigation of selected aspects of pathophysiological changes in body composition and its underlying causes after stroke in a mouse model. In particular, the development of muscular mass with regard to the potential incurrence of cachexia was meant to be examined. Methods For the study, a stroke was surgically induced through occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO model) in mice. During the subsequent seven days, body composition, weight, activity, neurological status as well as feed and water intake among the animals were measured. For comparison, untreated mice, a group of surgically treated animals without stroke induction and another group with stroke and antibiotic treatment were taken. Hence, consequences of the stroke could be separated from those deriving from surgical procedure and postoperative bacterial infection. Subsequently, the study animals were put to death painlessly, organs as well as muscle samples from both hind limbs were extracted, and the respective weight was determined. As marker for the catabolism in the skeletal muscle, proteasome (proteolysis) and caspase (apoptosis) activity were measured. In addition, the impact of poststroke weight loss on cardiac function was examined. For this purpose, on the third day after stroke induction, an echocardiography was performed on a separate animal group in order to determine cardiac parameters including the ejection fraction, the diameter of the left ventricle, and the wall thickness. Again, an <b>operated</b> group without <b>stroke</b> served as a comparison. Furthermore, in these groups all measurements were conducted according to the seven day experiment. Findings On the third day, the stroke group exhibited a pronounced loss in weight. Fat and nonfat tissue as well as body fluid were likewise reduced. On day three, feed intake of the stroke group was not decidedly reduced. Water absorption, however, was considerably lower than in the control surgery group. An alteration in spontaneous activity was not verifiable. After seven days, body weight showed a tendency to incomplete recovery. On day three after stroke, weight of the abdominal organs, the cardiac muscle, and the muscles of both hind limbs was distinctly reduced. At the same time, heart rate and cardiac output were reduced as well. On day seven, a tendency still towards lower organ and muscle weight in comparison to the animals without cerebral ischemia became apparent. Simultaneously, an elevated caspase- 3 activity in the skeletal muscle contralateral to stroke side was found. On the ipsilateral side of the body, a similar tendency became evident. The group treated with antibiotics revealed no differences from the stroke group. Conclusion During the first three days after its induction, stroke caused a loss of weight, which affected the fat and lean tissue as well as the body fluid. The muscular mass as part of the lean tissue was not solely reduced on the paralyzed side of the body. A reduced feed intake and altered physical activity could be excluded as the sole causes for these changes. Water absorption, however, seemed to have an impact on the development of the body fluid. There was evidence of an increased rate of apoptosis in the skeletal muscles on both sides of the body. This could have been causative for the changes in muscle mass. The influence of proteolytic processes and dehydration on alterations in muscle mass remained unclear. Antibiotic treatment had no impact on the results, therefore infections with Enrofloxacin-sensitive bacteria can be excluded as one cause for alterations in body composition. According to the results of the clinical examination of the animals, infections of other origin can be regarded unlikely, but an influence on body composition can not be excluded in this study. The stroke had a negative effect on the heart muscle and heart function. The present results suggest that an ischemic stroke regardless of food intake and motion intensity after the insult leads to the development of fat and muscle wasting and furthermore has a negative effect on cardiac function. Further studies are necessary in to clarify the exact mechanisms leading to these effects...|$|R
