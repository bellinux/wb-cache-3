To capture the Arrow <b>of</b> <b>Time,</b> a Qualitative Paradigm of Science is introduced that is a generalisation of the Mathematical Philosophy of Nature underpinning Quantitative Science.

40|$|International audienceOne {{hundred and}} thirty years after the work of Ludwig Boltzmann on the {{interpretation}} of the irreversibility of physical phenomena, and one century after Einstein's formulation of Special Relativity, we are still not sure what we mean when we talk <b>of</b> " <b>time</b> " or " arrow <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ". We shall try to show that one source of this difficulty is our tendency to confuse, at least verbally, time and becoming, i. e. the course <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and the arrow <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> two concepts that the formalisms of modern physics are careful to distinguish. The course <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is represented by a time line that leads us to define time as the producer of duration. It is customary to place on this time line a small arrow that, ironically, must not be confused with the " arrow <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ". This small arrow is only there to indicate that the course <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is oriented, has a well-defined direction, even if this direction is arbitrary. The arrow <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> on the other hand, indicates the possibility for physical systems to experience, over the course <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> changes or transformations that prevent them from returning to their initial state forever. Contrary to what the expression " arrow <b>of</b> <b>time</b> " suggests, it is therefore not a property <b>of</b> <b>time</b> itself but a property of certain physical phenomena whose dynamic is irreversible. By its very definition, the arrow <b>of</b> <b>time</b> presupposes the existence of a well-established course <b>of</b> <b>time</b> within which – in addition – certain phenomena have their own temporal orientation. We think that it is worthwhile to emphasize the difference between several issues traditionally subsumed under the label " the problem of the direction <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ". If the expressions " course <b>of</b> <b>time</b> ", " direction <b>of</b> <b>time</b> " and " arrow <b>of</b> <b>time</b> " were better defined, systematically distinguished from one another and always used in their strictest sense, the debate about time, irreversibility and becoming in physics would become clearer...|$|R

40|$|Maybe, {{before we}} speak <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> or maybe whilst we are {{speaking}} <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> or maybe {{after we have}} spoken <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> in the various modes <b>of</b> <b>time’s</b> insistence to exist, one should give time to the talk <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> There are various different modes <b>of</b> <b>time’s</b> insistence to exist, such as quantum physics in conversation with relativity theory where time is constructed as a fourth dimension of space. Or there are the modes <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in history, religion, psychology and philosophy, and each of these modes is composed, and composes its own specific object called time, and a particular subject who understands and interprets time in that particular mode. Yet, before, whilst or after these modes <b>of</b> <b>time’s</b> insistence to exist, one should maybe give time to time’s insistence: the talk <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Give time for the various times to articulate themselves in the various modes of existence, thereby creating both a whole plurality of differing subjects, as well as plurality of differing objects, all called ‘time’.

Hence, it is significant to consider the closedness <b>of</b> <b>time</b> scales under shifts because not only can it unify the discrete and continuous time scales (i.e., T=hZ or R) but also the quantum time scale (i.e., T=q^Z) and other irregular types <b>of</b> <b>time</b> scales such as (-q)^Z, N_±^ 1 / 2, etc.|$|R
