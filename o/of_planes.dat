Moreover, though the overall number <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> committed to battle by 12October dwarfed any force that Japan had previously fielded in the air, the U.S. Navy's Fast Carrier Force was capable of committing a much larger, significantly better-trained force.|$|E

Key words: special relativity, phase invariance, Lorentz transformation, Lorentz-covariant, negative frequency. PACS: 03. 30. +p special relativity. 1 The invariance of the phase <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> waves is an important concept in physics. Is the phase <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> waves a frame-independent quantity? To almost all physicists, the answer is yes. Nevertheless, the invariance of the phase <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> waves has never been proved; it is only postulated, or argued, to be valid. [1, 2]. From the invariance of the phase <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> waves, the 4 -vector (ω/c,k) <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> waves is shown to be Lorentz-covariant.

5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never {{given a chance to}} show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E
5|$|By then, SAS {{had taken}} sixteen {{aircraft}} out of service, reduced production with 12% and fired 1,000 employees. The airline {{stated that they}} wished to renegotiate the agreement with the Braathens family and KLM to reduce the price. Because there had arrisen a situation with high over-capacity of aircraft, the value <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> had fallen. In addition, SAS demanded that Braathens reduce its fleet from 33 to 23 aircraft if the deal was to go through, threatening to terminate the purchase if the airline did not abide.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control <b>of</b> <b>planes,</b> and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E

In this paper, buckling load of 15 one-story frames is obtained and then out <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> effective length factor of the longer member is calculated. Finally, as buckling of one of the members causes the system to lose its stability, the mentioned effective length factor is introduced as out <b>of</b> <b>plane</b> effective length factor for all OBS members...|$|R

The wing shared a {{commonality}} with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, the 103d Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing, which due to commission decisions, also changed the type <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> that they flew. Beginning in 2007, the F-15s began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport. With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based in Vermont took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies earlier than expected. This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.|$|E
5|$|Various {{delays in}} the arrival <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> and {{equipment}} meant that Baker's squadron was unable {{to participate in the}} final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The planes and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had the planes painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports {{at the time of his}} death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).|$|E
5|$|German air crews {{supported}} the Nationalist advance on Madrid and {{the relief of}} the Siege of the Alcázar. The Condor Legion's aircraft were accompanied by two armoured units. By the end of 1936, 7,000 Germans were in Spain. The Nationalists were supported by German units and equipment during the Battle of Madrid and during the Battle of Jarama of February 1937. The fighting demonstrated the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft compared to superior Soviet-made fighters. The War in the North {{was supported by a}} constantly re-equipping Condor Legion. In Operation Rügen, waves <b>of</b> <b>planes</b> bombed and strafed targets in Guernica leaving 1,685 people dead and over 900 injured. The offensive on Bilbao was supported by ground units and extensive air operations. It proved the worth of the Legion to the Nationalist cause. The Legion also took part in the Battle of Brunete and both land and air forces were involved in the Battle of Teruel. Up to 100 sorties a day were launched during the Nationalists' counter-offensive. The continued Nationalist offensive on Aragon in April–June 1937, including the Battle of Belchite, involved bombing raids {{and the use of the}} Legion's ground forces. On 24–25 July, Republican forces launched the Battle of the Ebro. Reconnaissance units of the Condor Legion warned Nationalists forces, but this went unheeded. 422 sorties by the Legion's aircraft had considerable effect. A reinforcement of the Legion enabled an important Nationalist counter-attack.|$|E
