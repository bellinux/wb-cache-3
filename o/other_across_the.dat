5|$|Although {{opposite}} each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> River Thames, Fulham on {{the north}} bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge {{to the west and}} Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's built-up area began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E

5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol.

5|$|For {{approximately}} five days the armies therefore confronted each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> plain of Marathon in stalemate. The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by {{a grove of}} trees, or an abbatis of stakes (depending on the exact reading). Since every day brought {{the arrival of the}} Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians. There were ten Athenian strategoi (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten tribes that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these. In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (polemarch), Callimachus, who had been elected by the whole citizen body. Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the strategoi, each taking in turn a day to command the army. He further suggests that each strategos, on his day in command, instead deferred to Miltiades. In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack. This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived, and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship. There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} summer, Stephen massed troops {{to renew the}} siege of Wallingford Castle in a final attempt to take the stronghold. The fall of Wallingford {{appeared}} imminent and Henry marched south to relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen returned with a large army, and the two sides confronted each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> River Thames at Wallingford in July. By {{this point in the}} war, the barons on both sides were eager to avoid an open battle, so members of the clergy brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Henry and Stephen. Henry and Stephen took the opportunity to speak together privately about a potential end to the war; conveniently for Henry, Stephen's son Eustace fell ill and died shortly afterwards. This removed the most obvious other claimant to the throne, as while Stephen had another son, William, he was only a second son and appeared unenthusiastic about making a plausible claim on the throne. Fighting continued after Wallingford, but in a rather half-hearted fashion, while the English Church attempted to broker a permanent peace between the two sides.|$|E

Cameron entrenched 50 men at the ford, and then moved the rest of his force west to face Mackintosh across the loch.|$|E
25|$|U.S. railroads {{still play}} a major role in the nation's freight shipping. They carried 750 billion {{ton-miles}} by 1975 which doubled to 1.5 trillion ton-miles in 2005. In the 1950s, the U.S. and Europe moved roughly the same percentage of freight by rail; by 2000, the share of U.S. rail freight was 38% while in Europe only 8% of freight traveled by rail. In 2000, while U.S. trains moved 2,390 billion ton-kilometers of freight, the 15-nation European Union moved only 304 billion ton-kilometers of freight. In terms of ton-miles, railroads annually move more than 25% of the United States' freight and connect businesses with each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country and with markets overseas.|$|E

25|$|The city sits in {{a saddle}} between the two {{mountains}} Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu, with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily, and enough land to grow food for about {{four times as many}} people as ever lived there. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops, and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides. Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.|$|E

The first {{antennae}} (antennules) are small, slender filaments on the ventral surface of the head, at about the same level as the eyes. The second antennae are similar and lie laterally to the first. They are nonfunctioning. The large, well-developed mandibles oppose each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> ventral midline. The opposing surfaces bear strong brownish teeth. As the crustacean periodically opens and closes the mandibles the teeth move apart and close together. Of the usual crustacean head appendages, only the mandibles are well developed. In Triops longicaudatus, the larger second maxillae are absent, only maxillules being present.|$|E

25|$|Freedmen {{were very}} active in forming their own churches, mostly Baptist or Methodist, and giving their ministers both moral and {{political}} leadership roles. In a process of self-segregation, practically all blacks left white churches so that few racially integrated congregations remained (apart from some Catholic churches in Louisiana). Four main groups competed with each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> South to form new Methodist churches composed of freedmen. They were the African Methodist Episcopal Church; the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church; the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church (which {{was sponsored by the}} white Methodist Episcopal Church, South) and the well-funded Methodist Episcopal Church (Northern white Methodists). By 1871 the Northern Methodists had 88,000 black members in the South, and had opened numerous schools for them.|$|E
25|$|The Nave, {{the body}} of the church, {{accommodates}} nine hundred sixty-six people for daily Masses and other ceremonies. The Nave has no pews, utilizing individual, movable chairs, complete with kneelers. Usually arranged in straight rows facing the altar and allowing for a center aisle and two side aisles, the chairs may also be placed in rows the length of the church, facing each <b>other</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> center aisle for special services such as those of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. It may also be noted that during the renovations by Conrad-Schmitt, the entire building was cracked down the middle and deeply in danger of collapse. To resolve this, steel strand beams were mounted from wall to wall in the nave to provide a counter push and pull action, keeping the building from falling in or out.|$|E
