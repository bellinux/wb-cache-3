25|$|In the United States, an {{exception}} is the merchant firm offer rule set out in Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer {{to buy or sell}} goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror. Such an offer is irrevocable {{even in the absence of}} consideration. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the <b>offeree</b> must be separately signed by the offeror.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the <b>offeree</b> must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding agreement. Notification of acceptance must actually reach a point where the offeror could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed mode of acceptance. It is not possible for an offeror to impose an obligation on the <b>offeree</b> to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the offeror may waive the need for communication of acceptance, either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require communication of acceptance, the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the offeror himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|E

50|$|When parties {{contract}} at a distance, {{questions arise}} {{as to when}} and where acceptance takes place. The general rule in South African law follows the information theory, which requires actual and conscious agreement between the contracting parties, such that agreement is established only when the offeror knows about the <b>offeree’s</b> acceptance. The place or venue {{of the formation of}} the contract is generally where the acceptance is brought to the offeror’s notice.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{an offer}} may be revoked {{provided}} the withdrawal reaches the <b>offeree</b> before {{or at the}} same time as the offer, or before the <b>offeree</b> has sent an acceptance. [...] Some offers may not be revoked; for example when the <b>offeree</b> reasonably relied upon the offer as being irrevocable. The CISG requires a positive act to indicate acceptance; silence or inactivity are not an acceptance.|$|E
50|$|Revocation of {{an offer}} must be {{received}} and understood by the <b>offeree</b> before it comes into effect. An acceptance by the <b>offeree</b> before they receive notice of the revocation will be considered valid.|$|E

50|$|The CISG {{attempts}} {{to resolve the}} common situation where an <b>offeree's</b> reply to an offer accepts the original offer, but {{attempts to}} change the conditions. The CISG says that any change to the original conditions is {{a rejection of the}} offer—it is a counter-offer—unless the modified terms do not materially alter the terms of the offer. Changes to price, payment, quality, quantity, delivery, liability of the parties, and arbitration conditions may all materially alter the terms of the offer.|$|R
40|$|It is such {{an honor}} to speak to you, {{especially}} since compared to the titans who have given the Schwartz Lecture in the past, I feel like an ADR manqué. I am going to proceed, nonetheless, and discuss the impact of counteroffers on negotiation. And I am {{going to try to}} convince you of four central claims: - Legal claim: The counteroffer is governed by what I will call the 2 ̆ 2 blow-up rule, 2 ̆ 2 which is a rare kind of double-jointed default. - Informational claim: <b>Offerees</b> are the first people to know when there are gains of trade. - Channeling claim: The blow-up rule dampens the incentive of <b>offerees</b> to inefficiently counter. - Psychological claim: Rejection aversion and other behavioral 2 ̆ 2 biases 2 ̆ 2 tend to cause people to reject offers too often. These counteroffer claims join together two disparate obsessions that I have with legal default rules and information forcing. The last claim even gives me a chance to indulge my penchant for why-not experimentation, where I have tried to put into practice the never-say-no attitude...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{analysis}} is to determine whether the UCC or the common law governs the transaction. If the UCC governs, courts will usually try to find which form constitutes the offer. Next, <b>offeree's</b> acceptance forms bearing the different terms is examined. One should note whether the acceptance is expressly conditional on its own terms. If it is expressly conditional, it is a counteroffer, not an acceptance. If performance is accepted after the counteroffer, even without express acceptance, under 2-207(3), a contract will exist under only those terms on which the parties agree, together with UCC gap-fillers.|$|R
50|$|An {{offer is}} {{rendered}} invalid upon {{the death of}} the <b>offeree.</b>|$|E
50|$|The offer {{cannot be}} {{accepted}} if the <b>offeree</b> knows {{of the death}} of the offeror. In cases where the <b>offeree</b> accepts in ignorance of the death, the contract may still be valid, although this proposition depends {{on the nature of the}} offer. If the contract involves some characteristic personal to the offeror, the offer is destroyed by the death.|$|E

40|$|The present {{progress}} in the information processing technology is having a drastic impact on the telecommunications industry and on many public networks by creating a separation between two components: on the one hand, the network {{made up of the}} infrastructures; on the other hand, the command networks which monitor the former {{and use it as a}} support for the provision of differentiated services. Whereas the network of infrastructures is a natural monopoly which should however be disciplined through the threat of potential competition, the command networks are likely to be <b>offereed</b> in a competitive market; the latter should nevertheless be organized, if not planned, due to externalities such as security and interoperability. ...|$|R
40|$|A central {{challenge}} {{to the study of}} animal aerodynamics has been the measurement <b>offerees</b> generated by flapping wings. Relative to wings of other birds, hummingbird wings are of particular interest in that the smaller species operate in more viscous regimes (5000 <Re < 10 000) for which substantial drag and reduced lift:drag coefficients might be expected. Lift and drag forces were measured on mounted hummingbird wings and wing models spinning in continuous tip wise revolution about the wing base. Lift coefficients tended to increase as wing models became more realistic (i. e. with sharpened leading edges and with substantial camber). Lift:drag ratios of real wings were substantially higher than those of wing models, suggesting morphological contributions of feathers to lift enhancement and drag reduction. At Re = 5000, high values of the lift:drag ratio (8 - 16) at low angles of attack suggest that wings of hummingbirds are exceptionally good at producing lift. Key words: aerodynamics, angle of attack, camber, hummingbird, leading edge, model wing...|$|R
5000|$|The Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") {{dispenses}} {{with the}} mirror image rule in § 2-207. UCC § 2-207(1) provides that a [...] "definite and seasonable expression of acceptance...operates as" [...] an acceptance, {{even though it}} varies {{the terms of the}} original offer. Such an expression is typically interpreted as an acceptance when it purports to accept and agrees on the following terms of the original offer: subject matter, quantity, and price. However, such an expression is not interpreted as an acceptance if it is [...] "expressly conditional" [...] on the original offeror's assent to the varied terms, discussed below. This language is known as the proviso. When the proviso is not used, the terms of the contract are determined by subsection 2. When the proviso is used, but there is no assent by the original offeror to the <b>offeree's</b> varied terms, yet the parties go ahead and perform (act like they have a contract, hence a contract implied in fact), the terms of the contract are determined by subsection 3. So, the terms of a contract under 2-207 are never determined by a combination of subsections 2 and 3.|$|R

50|$|Acceptance of {{an offer}} is an express or tacit {{statement}} of intention {{in which the}} <b>offeree</b> signifies his unconditional assent to the offer.

40|$|In {{face-to-face}} conversation, {{participants are}} co-responsible for the content, structure and effectiveness/acceptability of the interaction. This {{is especially true}} in goal-oriented communication, whose development and outcome depends on participants’ mutually relevant contributions. A case in point is that of dialogic speech acts. This paper examines offering sequencing in the transcripts of 30 open role-plays elicited from American native speakers through written prompts. The findings show that offerers and <b>offerees</b> employ these strategies: A) identical Conversation Management moves meeting communicative needs (e. g. opening/closing the interaction); B) complementary moves in line with participants’ initiating vs responding communicative-transactional roles such as Pre-condition ‘Mentioning or inquiring about the prerequisites that make the offer possible/sensible’ vs Pre-condition Check ‘Ascertaining pre-conditions for performing the offer’; Illocution Motivator ‘Justifying the offer’ vs Reaction motivator ‘Justifying the acceptance of the offer’; Acceptance-maximizer ‘Maximizing chances of acceptance’ vs Commitment Maximizer ‘Maximizing chances of the offerer’s commitment to the offer’ or Need Minimizer ‘Downplaying the need for the provision of a good/service’; and C) parallel, equivalent moves that move the interaction-transaction forward such as Background ‘Mentioning or inquiring about the characteristics of the offered good/service, or its provision and acceptance’; Negotiations ‘Checking, discussing or ratifying aspects/conditions of the feasibility of the offer’; Next steps ‘Announcing, proposing, inquiring about, acknowledging the (verbal) actions favouring the realization/acceptance of the offer’ The study reveals that: moves can be recognized by considering their content and positioning in the conversation, and especially through function-detecting heuristic prompts; the strategies realizing offers and reactions to them are similar across different interactional role-relationships; clusters of illocution-relevant moves show preferred sequencing patterns; and interlocutors cooperate towards the co-construction of goal-oriented interaction...|$|R

Silence cannot be requested by the offeror to be, or used by the <b>offeree</b> as a method of communication for acceptance. Rather, if after a reasonable period has lapsed, silence will be seen as a rejection to the offer, unless the offeree's actions objectively show otherwise.
