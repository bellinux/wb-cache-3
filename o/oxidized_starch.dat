The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of acetylation and oxidation on the structural, morphological, physical–chemical, thermal and pasting properties of barley starch. Barley starches were acetylated at different catalyst levels (11 %, 17 %, and 23 % of NaOH solution) and oxidized at different sodium hypochlorite concentrations (1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 % of active chlorine). Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms, thermal, morphological, and pasting properties, swelling power and solubility of starches were evaluated. The degree of substitution (DS) of the acetylated starches increased with the rise in catalyst concentration. The percentage of carbonyl (CO) and carboxyl (COOH) groups in <b>oxidized</b> <b>starches</b> also increased with the rise of active chlorine level. The presence of hydrophobic acetyl groups, carbonyl and carboxyl groups caused a partial disorganization and depolymerization of starch granules. The structural, morphological and functional changes in acetylated and <b>oxidized</b> <b>starches</b> varied according to reaction conditions. Acetylation makes barley starch more hydrophobic by the insertion of acetyl groups. Also the oxidation promotes low retrogradation and viscosity. All these characteristics are important for biodegradable film production...|$|R

40|$|Native starch {{has many}} {{industrial}} applications but its use {{is limited by}} certain technical difficulties. For example, in paper sizing {{it is almost impossible}} to apply the desired amount without making the drying process too slow, because ao much water has to be used to produee good flow characteristies. <b>Oxidized</b> <b>starches</b> are used very satisfactorily to reduee or eliminate such difficulties. They have greater colloidal stability, thus higher concentrations may be used in sizing. Their adhesive properties are better than those of native <b>starch.</b> The <b>oxidizing</b> agent is considered to change hydroxyl groups in the glucose units of starch to carbonyl and carboxyl groups and to decrease the molecular weight. It is probable that different oxidants show a preference for different types of hydroxyl group because the appearance and behaviour of oxystarches produced with different oxidants are different. Present knowledge of the chemistry of <b>oxidized</b> <b>starches</b> is scanty, although one or two detailed structural investigations have been made.

Results Uncoated synthesized magnetite nanoparticles and nanoparticles coated by different polysaccharides had no significant effect on synaptic vesicle acidification, the initial velocity of L-[14 C]glutamate uptake, ambient level of L-[14 C]glutamate and {{the potential of the}} plasma membrane of synaptosomes, and conductance of planar lipid membrane. Native ferritin-based magnetic nanoparticles had no effect on the membrane potential but significantly reduced L-[14 C]glutamate transport in synaptosomes and acidification of synaptic vesicles. Conclusions Our study indicates that synthesized magnetite nanoparticles in contrast to ferritin have no effects on the functional state and glutamate transport of nerve terminals, and so ferritin cannot be used as a prototype, analogue, or model of polysaccharide-coated magnetic nanoparticle in toxicity risk assessment and manipulation of nerve terminals by external magnetic fields.

Neste trabalho, amidos de batata, batata doce, {{mandioca}}, mandioquinha salsa, milho e milho ceroso foram modificados com KMnO 4 /ácido lático e NaOCl/ácido lático e caracterizados quanto ao teor de carboxilas, poder redutor, coloração diferencial, propriedade de expansão e propriedades viscoamilográficas, em água e tampões acetato (pH 4, 0) e fosfato (pH 7, 0). Amidos de milho ceroso e de mandioca modificados com KMnO 4 /ácido lático apresentaram elevadas expansões (25, 8 e 24, 1 mL. g- 1, respectivamente). As pastas de amido de milho ceroso resistiram a ciclos de congelamento/descongelamento. A coloração diferencial e o teor de carboxilas não permitiram diferenciar as amostras; apenas o amido de batata reagiu com azul de metileno devido aos grupos fosfato. Quanto ao pH e acidez, as amostras apresentaram valores próximos da neutralidade, exceto o amido de milho e milho ceroso modificados com NaOCl. Amidos oxidados com KMnO 4 /ácido lático apresentaram picos de viscosidade inferiores aos tratados com NaOCl. Os picos de viscosidade em tampão fosfato foram inferiores aos em água e em tampão acetato. <b>Oxidized</b> <b>starches</b> produce low-viscosity pastes even in high concentrations, are stable to retrogradation and {{are used}} in the paper, textile and food industries. This property is attributed to the presence of carboxyl groups, which have negative charges and are bulkier than hydroxyls. In this work, potato, sweet potato, Peruvian carrot, cassava, corn and waxy corn starches were modified with oxidative reagents and characterized with respect to their carboxyl content, reducing power, differential dyeing, expansion power and viscographic properties, in water, acetate buffer (pH 4. 0) and phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0). The results showed that waxy corn and cassava starches presented high expansions, when modified with KMNO 4 /lactic acid (25. 8 and 24. 1 mL. g- 1, respectively). The starch pastes of waxy corn showed freeze-thaw stability in all treatments. Differential dyeing and carboxyl content did not vary between the native and modified samples; only potato starch reacted with methylene blue, due to the presence of phosphate groups. With respect to pH and acidity, almost all samples presented values next to neutrality, except corn and waxy corn starch modified with NaOCl/lactic acid.

40|$|Different {{combinations}} of hydrophilic (glycerol and water) and amphiphilic (isoleucine) plasticizers were {{studied in the}} production of thermoplastic starch (TPS) powders and films from <b>oxidized</b> potato <b>starch.</b> All powder samples had an irregular and shrivelled morphology. In all mixtures containing isoleucine, this additive exuded from the starch matrix and re-crystallized during spray drying, resulting in hollow particles. The crystallinity and moisture sensitivity of freshly prepared films depended on the isoleucine content in the plasticizer formulation. Increasing the content led to a decrease in moisture absorption. Isoleucine formulated films showed the best tensile strength, whereas glycerol-rich ones showed better strain at break values. All glycerol plasticized formulations and the spray dried non-modified starch were amorphous. Glycerol reduced the glass transition temperature to 128 degrees C and glycerol formulated films showed the highest moisture uptake due to its hydrophilic nature.
