25|$|In {{the wake}} of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats {{believed}} that Democrats should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president.

25|$|Blix's {{statements}} about the Iraq WMD program came to contradict {{the claims of the}} George W.

In an interview on BBC 1 on 8 February 2004, Blix accused the US and British governments of dramatizing the threat of weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> in order to strengthen the case for the 2003 war against the government of Saddam Hussein. Ultimately, no stockpiles {{of weapons of mass destruction}} were ever found.|$|E

Much later, the alleged weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> affair {{certainly}} dirtied the previously favourable image. In 2008, 85% of the French people considered the American government and banks to be most liable for the Financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E
25|$|Since the September 11 attacks, DIA {{has been}} active in nuclear {{proliferation}} intelligence collection and analysis with particular interests in North Korea and Iran as well as counter-terrorism. DIA was also involved with the intelligence build-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was a subject in the Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq. After the invasion, DIA led the Iraq Survey Group to find the alleged Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Agency has conflicted with the CIA in collection and analysis on the existence of weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and has often represented the Pentagon in the CIA–DoD intelligence rivalry due to DIA's own Clandestine HUMINT collection.|$|E
25|$|David Christopher Kelly, CMG (14 May 1944 – 17 July 2003) was a Welsh {{scientist}} and authority on biological warfare, {{employed by the}} British Ministry of Defence, and formerly a weapons inspector with the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq. He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> was cited by Gilligan {{and led to a}} major controversy. Kelly's name became known to the media as Gilligan's source and he was called to appear on 15 July before a parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee investigating the issues Gilligan had reported. Kelly was questioned aggressively about his actions. He was found dead two days later.|$|E

25|$|In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had {{approved}} {{of military action}} against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed {{the threat of terrorism}} directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that {{there was no evidence of}} weapons <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.|$|E

According to the Globe and Mail, the song resembles a love song with a sense of [...] "menace" [...] and [...] "grim political showdown". Yorke was uncomfortable about the subject matter and conscious of Kelly's grieving family, but felt that [...] "not to write it would perhaps have been worse." [...] In an interview with the Observer, he said it was [...] "the most angry song" [...] he had ever written.|$|E

[...] sees a rivalry between MI5 and MI6. According to the producers, there have been documented rivalries between the two organisations. The episode also based a true story of a man joining a militant group and was paid with a Russian army helicopter, as the group could not afford to pay him in cash. [...] "A Prayer for My Daughter" [...] deals with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Because the topic is controversial, it was a difficult area to work with without offending people from both sides. The producers made the episode as neutral as possible by consulting with experts {{from both sides of the}} conflict. Richards also wanted to fairly represent it by addressing the issue as political and not religious.|$|E
500|$|Gilmore {{participated in}} his final debate on June 5 in Goffstown, New Hampshire {{telecast}} by CNN. During this debate, Gilmore spoke less than all of his nine fellow candidates.

When asked if he had a problem with oil companies making a profit, Gilmore stated that he saw no problems with it and that he believed this was [...] "an appropriate thing to do." [...] He later confirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol because it [...] "was going to basically just transfer money directly to Russia for nothing" [...] and that it must include [...] "every nation of the world in this entire project...includ China and India" [...] to meet his approval. But {{at the end of the}} debate when asked if he believed a conservative could include conservationist principles, he answered that he believed it could be a part of the platform because [...] "energy independence...is a national security issue" [...] which serves the interests of Conservatives by preserving a [...] "clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation." ...|$|E
