Pouting has also been observed with the Chinese, Abyssinians, Malays of Malacca, Dyaks of Borneo, and often with the New Zealanders. Mr. Mansel Weale informs me that he has seen the lips much protruded, not only with the children of the Kafirs, but with the adults of both sexes when sulky; and Mr. Stack has sometimes observed {{the same thing with the}} men, and very frequently with the women of New Zealand.

Accordingly I asked one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>informants,</b> a surgeon, to attend to the effects of retching when nothing was thrown up from the stomach; and, by an odd coincidence, he himself suffered the next morning from an attack of retching, and three days subsequently observed a lady under a similar attack; and he is certain that in neither case an atom of matter was ejected from the stomach; yet the orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and tears freely secreted.

6000|$|But I {{may seem}} to exaggerate the degree of white opposition. And {{it is true that}} before fate overtook the Brandeis government, it {{appeared}} to enjoy the fruits of victory in Apia; and one dissident, the unconquerable Moors, stood out alone to refuse his taxes. But the victory was in appearance only; the opposition was latent; it found vent in talk, and thus reacted on the natives; upon the least excuse, it was ready to flame forth again. And this is the more singular because some were far from out of sympathy with the native policy pursued. When I met Captain Brandeis, he was amazed at my attitude. [...] "Whom did you find in Apia to tell you so much good of me?" [...] he asked. I named one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>informants.</b> [...] "He?" [...] he cried.

He beheld in the government of Brandeis a government created by and for the firm who were his rivals. If Brandeis were minded to deal fairly, where was the probability that he would be allowed? If Brandeis insisted and were strong enough to prevail, what guarantee that, as soon as the government were fairly accepted, Brandeis might not be removed? Here was the attitude of the hour; and I am glad to find it clearly set forth in a despatch of Sewall's, June 18th, 1888, when he commends the law against mortgages, and goes on: [...] "Whether the author of this law will carry out the good intentions which he professes--whether he will be allowed to do so, if he desires, against the opposition of those who placed him in power and protect him in the possession of it--may well be doubted." [...] Brandeis had come to Apia in the firm's livery. Even while he promised neutrality in commerce, the clerks were prating a different story in the bar-rooms; and the late high feat of the knight-errant, Becker, had killed all confidence in Germans at the root. By these three impolicies, the German adventure in Samoa was defeated.|$|E

"No," [...] Mr Humphreys said; [...] "they {{were all}} {{published}} {{a few years}} since, {{and none of them}} treat much of the affairs of the Transvaal, which, as an independent state, had comparatively little interest to English settlers. There are in the Transvaal, which is of immense extent, {{a very large number of}} natives, enormously outnumbering the Boers. In the southern districts, where the Boers are strongest, they cruelly ill-treat the natives, making slaves of them, and thinking no more of shooting one of them down than they would of shooting a dog. In the outlying provinces they live almost on sufferance of the natives, and, were these to unite their forces and rise, they could annihilate the Dutch. Secoceni is a powerful chief, who lives with his tribe in a natural stronghold; he has always held himself as independent of the Dutch. As his men used to make raids upon the Boers' cattle, the latter attacked him, and in alliance with Swazis, another powerful tribe, endeavoured to carry his fortress; they were, however, badly beaten; it being only by the gallantry of their native allies that the Boer contingent was saved from destruction. Secoceni then took the offensive. A perfect panic seized the Boers; they refused to obey the orders of their government, and to turn out to resist the invaders. The treasury was empty, for their government had never been enabled to persuade them to pay taxes. They applied for aid to Natal, but finally their plight was so bad that they were glad to accept the offer which Mr Shepstone made them, of annexation to England, by which they secured our protection and were safe from annihilation. Secoceni was not the only enemy who threatened them. They had a still more formidable foe in the Zulus on the eastern frontier. These are a very warlike people, and it was known that their king meditated the conquest of the Transvaal. But, glad enough as the Boers were at the moment to accept the protection of England, now that the danger is over a great many of them would like to kick down the bridge which has helped them over the stream.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study, using a narrative approach, is that through a life story from an adult woman get {{a better understanding of}} how it can be for a student with reading and writing difficulties at secondary school. The focus of the study is to find out more about how difficulties in reading and writing can affect the time in school and if there may be links between illiteracy and a negative self-image, and if there is a risk that the difficulties could lead to an exclusion for the student.   Life story was used as a method to take part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>informant’s</b> experiences from a social constructionist perspective with the understanding that meaning is created in the interaction with others. Initially, it was an interview conversation with the informant, which was then compiled into a life story.   In the result I came to the conclusion that there is an increased risk for low self-esteem of students who has reading and writing difficulties, especially if they do not get the proper support and backing of the school. A student rarely chooses an exclusion but sometimes feels that is a way to avoid risking failure. Shame and a negative self-image is common with students who struggle with reading and writing. Success factors are the teachers' pedagogical skills in which they have a varied approach and in a good way can join the student's conditions with environmental requirements. A close and trusting relationship between students and teachers, as well as a secure safety net are extra important factors to these students to get by and get positive experiences from their schooling...|$|R

A race meeting was being held {{near the town of}} El Carmen, on a high exposed piece of ground, when, shortly before sunset, a violent pampero wind came up, laden with dense dust-clouds. A few moments before the storm broke, the air all at once became obscured with a prodigious cloud of dragon-flies.

6000|$|But, indeed, kings are {{to guard}} against {{the same sort of}} dispositions in themselves. They are very easily alienated from all the higher orders of their subjects, whether civil or military, laic or ecclesiastical. It is with persons of {{condition}} that sovereigns chiefly come into contact. It is from them that they generally experience opposition to their will. It is with their pride and impracticability that princes are most hurt. It is with their servility and baseness that they are most commonly disgusted. It is from their humors and cabals that they find their affairs most frequently troubled and distracted. But of the common people, in pure monarchical governments, kings know little or nothing; and therefore being unacquainted with their faults, (which are as many as those of the great, and much more decisive in their effects, when accompanied with power,) kings generally regard them with tenderness and favor, and turn their eyes towards that description of their subjects, particularly when hurt by opposition from the higher orders. It was thus that the king of France (a perpetual example to all sovereigns) was ruined. I have it from very sure information, (and it was, indeed, obvious enough, from the measures which were taken previous to the assembly of the States and afterwards,) that the king's counsellors had filled him with a strong dislike to his nobility, his clergy, and the corps of his magistracy. They represented to him, that he had tried them all severally, in several ways, and found them all untractable: that he had twice called an assembly (the Notables) composed of the first men of the clergy, the nobility, and the magistrates; that he had himself named every one member in those assemblies, and that, though so picked out, he had not, in this their collective state, found them more disposed to a compliance with his will than they had been separately; that there remained for him, with the least prospect of advantage to his authority in the States-General, which were to be composed of the same sorts of men, but not chosen by him, only the Tiers État: in this alone he could repose any hope of extricating himself from his difficulties, and of settling him in a clear and permanent authority. They represented, (these are the words of one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>informants,)</b> [...] "that the royal authority, compressed with the weight of these aristocratic bodies, full of ambition and of faction, when once unloaded, would rise of itself, and occupy its natural place without disturbance or control"; that the common people would protect, cherish, and support, instead of crushing it. [...] "The people" [...] (it was said) [...] "could entertain no objects of ambition"; they were out of the road of intrigue and cabal, and could possibly have no other view than the support of the mild and parental authority by which they were invested, for the first time collectively, with real importance in the state, and protected in their peaceable and useful employments.|$|E
6000|$|We here {{see that}} in the {{interval}} of forty years, between 1832 and 1872, the population has decreased no less than sixty-eight per cent.! This has been attributed by most writers to the profligacy of the women, to former bloody wars, and to the severe labour imposed on conquered tribes and to newly introduced diseases, which have been on several occasions extremely destructive. No doubt these and other such causes have been highly efficient, and may account for the extraordinary rate of decrease between the years 1832 and 1836; but the most potent of all the causes seems to be lessened fertility. According to Dr. Ruschenberger of the U.S. Navy, who visited these islands between 1835 and 1837, in one district of Hawaii, only twenty-five men out of 1134, and in another district only ten out of 637, had a family with as many as three children. Of eighty married women, only thirty-nine had ever borne children; and [...] "the official report gives an average of half a child to each married couple in the whole island." [...] This is almost exactly the same average as with the Tasmanians at Oyster Cove. Jarves, who published his History in 1843, says that [...] "families who have three children are freed from all taxes; those having more, are rewarded by gifts of land and other encouragements." [...] This unparalleled enactment by the government well shews how infertile the race had become. The Rev. A. Bishop stated in the Hawaiian 'Spectator' in 1839, that {{a large proportion of the}} children die at early ages, and Bishop Staley informs me that this is still the case, just as in New Zealand. This has been attributed to the neglect of the children by the women, but it is probably in large part due to innate weakness of constitution in the children, in relation to the lessened fertility of their parents. There is, moreover, a further resemblance to the case of New Zealand, in the fact that there is a large excess of male over female births: the census of 1872 gives 31,650 males to 25,247 females of all ages, that is 125.36 males for every 100 females; whereas in all civilised countries the females exceed the males. No doubt the profligacy of the women may in part account for their small fertility; but their changed habits of life is a much more probable cause, and which will at the same time account for the increased mortality, especially of the children. The islands were visited by Cook in 1779, Vancouver in 1794, and often subsequently by whalers. In 1819 missionaries arrived, and found that idolatry had been already abolished, and other changes effected by the king. After this period there was a rapid change in almost all the habits of life of the natives, and they soon became [...] "the most civilised of the Pacific Islanders." [...] One <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>informants,</b> Mr. Coan, who was born on the islands, remarks that the natives have undergone a greater change in their habits of life in the course of fifty years than Englishmen during a thousand years. From information received from Bishop Staley, it does not appear that the poorer classes have ever much changed their diet, although many new kinds of fruit have been introduced, and the sugar-cane is in universal use. Owing, however, to their passion for imitating Europeans, they altered their manner of dressing at an early period, and the use of alcoholic drinks became very general. Although these changes appear inconsiderable, I can well believe, from what is known with respect to animals, that they might suffice to lessen the fertility of the natives. (43. The foregoing statements are taken chiefly from the following works: Jarves' 'History of the Hawaiian Islands,' 1843, pp. 400-407. Cheever, 'Life in the Sandwich Islands,' 1851, p. 277. Ruschenberger is quoted by Bonwick, 'Last of the Tasmanians,' 1870, p. 378. Bishop is quoted by Sir E. Belcher, 'Voyage Round the World,' 1843, vol. i. p. 272. I owe the census of the several years to the kindness of Mr. Coan, at the request of Dr. Youmans of New York; and in most cases I have compared the Youmans figures with those given in several of the above-named works. I have omitted the census for 1850, as I have seen two widely different numbers given.) ...|$|E

When I tell you besides that Jim with his own hands had worked at the rustic fence, you will perceive directly the difference, the individual side of the story. There is in his espousal of memory and affection belonging to another human being something characteristic of his seriousness. He had a conscience, {{and it was a}} romantic conscience. Through her whole life the wife of the unspeakable Cornelius had no other companion, confidant, and friend but her daughter. How the poor woman had come to marry the awful little Malacca Portuguese--after the separation from the father of her girl--and how that separation had been brought about, whether by death, which can be sometimes merciful, or by the merciless pressure of conventions, is a mystery to me. From the little which Stein (who knew so many stories) had let drop in my hearing, I am convinced that she was no ordinary woman. Her own father had been a white; a high official; one of the brilliantly endowed men who are not dull enough to nurse a success, and whose careers so often end under a cloud. I suppose she too must have lacked the saving dullness--and her career ended in Patusan. Our common fate [...] . for where is the man--I mean a real sentient man--who does not remember vaguely having been deserted in the fullness of possession by some one or something more precious than life? [...] . our common fate fastens upon the women with a peculiar cruelty. It does not punish like a master, but inflicts lingering torment, as if to gratify a secret, unappeasable spite. One would think that, appointed to rule on earth, it seeks to revenge itself upon the beings that come nearest to rising above the trammels of earthly caution; for it is only women who manage to put at times into their love an element just palpable enough to give one a fright--an extra-terrestrial touch. I ask myself with wonder--how the world can look to them--whether it has the shape and substance we know, the air we breathe! Sometimes I fancy it must be a region of unreasonable sublimities seething with the excitement of their adventurous souls, lighted by the glory of all possible risks and renunciations. However, I suspect there are very few women in the world, though of course I am aware of the multitudes of mankind and of the equality of sexes--in point of numbers, that is. But I am sure that the mother was as much of a woman as the daughter seemed to be. I cannot help picturing to myself these two, at first the young woman and the child, then the old woman and the young girl, the awful sameness and the swift passage of time, the barrier of forest, the solitude and the turmoil round these two lonely lives, and every word spoken between them penetrated with sad meaning. There must have been confidences, not so much of fact, I suppose, as of innermost feelings--regrets--fears--warnings, no doubt: warnings that the younger did not fully understand till the elder was dead--and Jim came along. Then I am sure she understood much--not everything--the fear mostly, it seems. Jim called her by a word that means precious, {{in the sense of a}} precious gem--jewel. Pretty, isn't it? But he was capable of anything. He was equal to his fortune, as he--after all--must have been equal to his misfortune. Jewel he called her; and he would say this as he might have said [...] "Jane," [...] don't you know--with a marital, homelike, peaceful effect. I heard the name for the first time ten minutes after I had landed in his courtyard, when, after nearly shaking my arm off, he darted up the steps and began to make a joyous, boyish disturbance at the door under the heavy eaves. [...] "Jewel! O Jewel! Quick! Here's a friend come," [...] . and suddenly peering at me in the dim verandah, he mumbled earnestly, [...] "You know--this--no confounded nonsense about it--can't tell you how much I owe to her--and so--you understand--I--exactly as if [...] ." [...] His hurried, anxious whispers were cut short by the flitting of a white form within the house, a faint exclamation, and a child-like but energetic little face with delicate features and a profound, attentive glance peeped out of the inner gloom, like a bird out of the recess of a nest. I was struck by the name, of course; but it was not till later on that I connected it with an astonishing rumour that had met me on my journey, at a little place on the coast about 230 miles south of Patusan River. Stein's schooner, in which I had my passage, put in there, to collect some produce, and, going ashore, I found to my great surprise that the wretched locality could boast of a third-class deputy-assistant resident, a big, fat, greasy, blinking fellow of mixed descent, with turned-out, shiny lips. I found him lying extended on his back in a cane chair, odiously unbuttoned, with a large green leaf of some sort on the top of his steaming head, and another in his hand which he used lazily as a fan [...] . Going to Patusan? Oh yes. Stein's Trading Company. He knew. Had a permission? No business of his. It was not so bad there now, he remarked negligently, and, he went on drawling, [...] "There's some sort of white vagabond has got in there, I hear. [...] . Eh? What you say? Friend of yours? So! [...] . Then it was true there was one of these verdammte--What was he up to? Found his way in, the rascal. Eh? I had not been sure. Patusan--they cut throats there--no business of ours." [...] He interrupted himself to groan. [...] "Phoo! Almighty! The heat! The heat! Well, then, there might be something in the story too, after all, and [...] ." [...] He shut one of his beastly glassy eyes (the eyelid went on quivering) while he leered at me atrociously with the other. [...] "Look here," [...] says he mysteriously, [...] "if--do you understand?--if he has really got hold of something fairly good--none of your bits of green glass--understand?--I am a Government official--you tell the rascal [...] . Eh? What? Friend of yours?" [...] . He continued wallowing calmly in the chair [...] "You said so; that's just it; and I am pleased to give you the hint. I suppose you too would like to get something out of it? Don't interrupt. You just tell him I've heard the tale, but to my Government I have made no report. Not yet. See? Why make a report? Eh? Tell him to come to me if they let him get alive out of the country. He had better look out for himself. Eh? I promise to ask no questions. On the quiet--you understand? You too--you shall get something from me. Small commission for the trouble. Don't interrupt. I am a Government official, and make no report. That's business. Understand? I know some good people that will buy anything worth having, and can give him more money than the scoundrel ever saw in his life. I know his sort." [...] He fixed me steadfastly with both his eyes open, while I stood over him utterly amazed, and asking myself whether he was mad or drunk. He perspired, puffed, moaning feebly, and scratching himself with such horrible composure that I could not bear the sight long enough to find out. Next day, talking casually with the people of the little native court of the place, I discovered that a story was travelling slowly down the coast about a mysterious white man in Patusan who had got hold of an extraordinary gem--namely, an emerald of an enormous size, and altogether priceless. The emerald seems to appeal more to the Eastern imagination than any other precious stone. The white man had obtained it, I was told, partly by the exercise of his wonderful strength and partly by cunning, from the ruler of a distant country, whence he had fled instantly, arriving in Patusan in utmost distress, but frightening the people by his extreme ferocity, which nothing seemed able to subdue. Most <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>informants</b> were of the opinion that the stone was probably unlucky,--like the famous stone of the Sultan of Succadana, which in the old times had brought wars and untold calamities upon that country. Perhaps it was the same stone--one couldn't say. Indeed the story of a fabulously large emerald is as old as the arrival of the first white men in the Archipelago; and the belief in it is so persistent that less than forty years ago there had been an official Dutch inquiry into the truth of it. Such a jewel--it was explained to me by the old fellow from whom I heard most of this amazing Jim-myth--a sort of scribe to the wretched little Rajah of the place;--such a jewel, he said, cocking his poor purblind eyes up at me (he was sitting on the cabin floor out of respect), is best preserved by being concealed about the person of a woman. Yet it is not every woman that would do. She must be young--he sighed deeply--and insensible to the seductions of love. He shook his head sceptically. But such a woman seemed to be actually in existence. He had been told of a tall girl, whom the white man treated with great respect and care, and who never went forth from the house unattended. People said the white man could be seen with her almost any day; they walked side by side, openly, he holding her arm under his--pressed to his side--thus--in a most extraordinary way. This might be a lie, he conceded, for it was indeed a strange thing for any one to do: on the other hand, there could be no doubt she wore the white man's jewel concealed upon her bosom.' ...|$|E

Taking its starting point in a fascination of the subversive political potential of challenging the predominant discourse of sexual essentialism it examines which aspects <b>of</b> gender studies <b>my</b> <b>informants</b> attach importance to when relating them to their shifts in desire. The investigation builds on a {{survey conducted by the}} author 2007, which revealed that shifts in desire, sexual practices and/or gender identities are relatively common amongst gender studies students. Building on these results the article examines how the 'shifts' are perceived and explained theoretically and politically by the students.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{five and a half}} months of {{fieldwork}} in Los Angeles, California in 2012, and explores how a non-profit Pentecostal Christian charity organization combines social work with evangelizing. From the material I collected through spending time within a highly religious community, I identify possible explanations to why Pentecostalism is considered the fastest growing religious denomination in the world by many. By analyzing the very different ways Pentecostals tell their own conversion narratives and the way they count other people's conversions, I suggest that the numbers of converts reported by Pentecostal organizations themselves might be questionable. Through different salvation strategies <b>my</b> <b>informants</b> were highly occupied with counting as many converts as they could with every outreach event. In addition, I found that performances <b>of</b> faith for <b>my</b> <b>informants</b> were regulated and adapted to their audience, and that the use of glossolalia and different forms of prayer rarely seemed arbitrary. The thesis also offers a discussion on how I as an atheist was welcomed and appreciated, but constantly encouraged to convert by <b>my</b> <b>informants.</b> Some <b>of</b> the possible reasons I identify for the rapid growth of Pentecostalism include beliefs in the ability to attain spiritual gifts like tongue speak, divine healing and charismatic leadership skills. I argue that the belief in the availability of such gifts can draw converts to Pentecostalism. As can the affiliation with prosperity theology; seeking wealth was encouraged by <b>my</b> <b>informants,</b> but preferably through donations to the church, a gift that a miracle was expected to return. With the federal Faith-Based Initiative, much of the social responsibilities of the US state now rests upon religious organizations, who are perceived as able to provide a holistic form of care, catering to both the need of the bodies and the souls of the homeless and the poor. I argue that when marginalized people become dependent on religious organizations for basic help, saying yes to salvation multiple times becomes a way of reciprocating the material gifts given by these organizations...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} discourses and {{practices}} of indigenous people of Amazonia, there {{is a mixture of}} various, conflicting kinds of rationality, which points out the coexistence of different conceptual frameworks. This coexistence appears in so many diverse forms that it would be very simplifying to describe it merely in terms of acculturation and resistance. It can be better approached as a cultural heterogeneity, which has to be analyzed case by case. This article focuses on an Ashéninka woman, who was one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> main <b>informants</b> ten years ago in a project for the evaluation and analysis of ethnobotanical knowledge on the Brazil-Peru border, and who later on was responsible for taking care of a medicinal garden for a project financed by a European NGO. This led to a marked impoverishment of her ethnomedicinal knowledge. To explain such a paradoxical outcome, the paper describes former and current processes of regional and interethnic borrowing, analyzes the indigenous conceptions about knowledge and therapeutic efficacy, and underlines the emphasis on relational criteria. These criteria are precisely what this woman is giving up now. </p...|$|R
