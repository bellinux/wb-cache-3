5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less.|$|E
5|$|In the {{official}} records of another Bronze Age empire, {{that of the}} Hittites in Anatolia, various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named Ahhiyawa. Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, {{as well as on}} recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term Ahhiyawa must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> a part of it. This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control. Another similar ethnonym Ekwesh in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.|$|E
5|$|These {{unauthorised}} performances {{took many}} forms, including burlesques, productions with men playing women's roles and vice versa, spoofs, variety acts, Minstrel show versions, all-black and Catholic productions, German, Yiddish and other foreign-language versions, performances on boats or by church choirs, and productions starring casts of children. Few purported {{to play the}} opera as written. Sheet music arrangements were popular, there were Pinafore-themed dolls and household items, and references to the opera were common in advertising, news and other media. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte brought lawsuits in the U.S. and tried {{for many years to}} control the American performance copyrights over their operas, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> claim some royalties, without success. They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, by giving the official premiere in New York.|$|E

T. F. O'Rahilly notably believed the Ulaid were an actual branch of the Érainn.

25|$|After Suppiluliumas I, and a {{very brief}} reign by his eldest son, another son, Mursili II became king (c. 1330). Having {{inherited}} a position of strength in the east, Mursili was able to turn {{his attention to the}} west, where he attacked Arzawa and a city known as Millawanda (Miletus) which was under the control of Ahhiyawa. More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, {{as well as of the}} material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that Ahhiyawa referred to Mycenaean Greece, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> a part of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} patentee, {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>to</b> try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.|$|E

His ambitions to improve the standing of Romanian Rusyns were challenged by the Ukrainian National Party, and he remained {{the leader of a}} Russophile minority within the larger Ukrainian one. Bogatyrets championed the use of Slavic vernaculars in both education and church services, and did missionary work among the Ukrainians of Maramureș/Maramorosh.

The Carson expedition was the second invasion of the heart of the Comancheria, after the Antelope Hills Expedition.|$|E
