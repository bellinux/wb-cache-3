Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, {{except for the}} eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors,</b> Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a background or financial history.|$|E

As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} story about Washington's {{childhood}} {{is that he}} chopped down his father's favorite cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned: [...] "I can't tell a lie, Pa." [...] The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems, who interviewed people after Washington's death who knew him as a child over a half-century earlier. The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century, for example in McGuffey Readers. Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history, especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington. After 1890 historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement, {{and there was no}} documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems' report that he learned it from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> who knew the young Washington. Joseph Rodman claimed in 1904 that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England, but no one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story.|$|E

GeoDTN+Nav is a hybrid protocol, which not only provides protection of private data but also helps in taking the best-effort routing decision.|$|R
2500|$|After a {{few days}} of {{observation}} at his new home in Indian Territory, Loughridge bought a horse and saddle, and set out to find the most appropriate place for the mission; at the suggestion of the principal chief it was located in the area of present-day Coweta. Loughridge bought a vacant Indian cabin 14x24feet, with a dirt floor and covered with clapboards. It was located on a small unfenced field and had a few fruit trees. He paid the owner ten dollars, and named it [...] "Koweta". The Mission was situated one and one-half miles east of the Arkansas River, and twenty-four miles northhwest of Fort Gibson. Very soon a larger cabin was built for school and church purposes, and the people were notified to attend church, and {{to send their children to}} school; fifteen or twenty children were enrolled. His wife, an experienced and well-qualified teacher, commenced the school; only a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> were disposed to attend preaching, while most of the Indians were devotedly attached to their old customs and religions.|$|E

Genovese arrived home around 3:15a.m. and parked her car in the Kew Gardens Station Long Island Rail Road parking lot, about [...] from her apartment's door, in an alleyway {{at the rear of the}} building. As she walked toward the apartment complex, Moseley, [...] who had followed her home, exited his vehicle, which he had parked at a corner bus stop on Austin Street, and approached Genovese armed with a hunting knife. Genovese ran toward the front of the building, and Moseley ran after her, overtook her and stabbed her twice in the back. Genovese screamed, [...] "Oh my God, he stabbed me! Help me!". Several neighbors heard her cry, but only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help. When Robert Mozer, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors,</b> shouted at the attacker [...] "Let that girl alone!", Moseley ran away and Genovese slowly made her way toward the rear entrance of the building, seriously injured and out of view of any witnesses.|$|E

2500|$|On February 13, 1838, the {{secretary}} of the Municipality of Ponce met with civic leaders of the [...] "Villa of Ponce" [...] to discuss plans for building a new cemetery. The existing cemetery was in deplorable and bad condition, and it posed a danger to public health. [...] Because the [...] "Villa of Ponce" [...] did not have the money to build the cemetery, a voluntary proportional contribution was established in which all neighbors were to contribute. A commission was named composed of one member of the Municipal Council and four neighbors of influence to open up a voluntary subscription, name a depository and to proceed with the construction of the cemetery until its completion. The project was to be carried out in a lot adjacent to the existing cemetery extending one hundred square [...] "varas" [...] (a measure of length equal to 0.84m. approximately). Named by vote to form the commission were the [...] "Sor Sindico" [...] '(secretary to the mayor of the [...] "Villa") and the neighbor leaders Don Geronimo Ortiz, Don Tomas Souffront, Don Luis Font, and Don Mateo Maenamaxe. On February 26, 1838, the project was approved by the mayor of Ponce. However, it was not until 1842 that the project was started out with the contributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> of the [...] "Villa". In 1843, the cemetery was inaugurated {{under the auspices of the}} mayor of Ponce, Don Juan Rondon Martinez, also the first person to be buried there. In 1864 the cemetery was enlarged and repaired. The new work consisted of repairs and construction of the enclosing walls and pathways, construction of new niches and construction of a chapel and mortuary. In 1915 the cemetery was closed down.|$|E

30|$|It {{means that}} <b>the</b> {{variation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> table rises {{with the increasing}} node velocity. However, velocity of a vehicle in VANETs is affected by <b>the</b> speed limit <b>of</b> road, <b>the</b> vehicle in front, and the network density. When the network density is sparse, speed of a vehicle can reach the maximum speed limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road. Then with the increasing network density, the maximum speed reached by a vehicle is smaller than maximum speed limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road once the network is saturated. So, a random vehicle in VANETs has a maximum velocity. Thus, HI has a minimum threshold while <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> table has a maximum value.|$|R
