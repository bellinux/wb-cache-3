5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> the game's quest without external aid.|$|E

500|$|McAdams first {{developed}} {{an interest in}} performing when she was seven years old, and while her parents did not discourage her, they did not [...] "go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> [...] an agent."

While at university, McAdams worked with the Toronto-based Necessary Angel Theatre Company.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} before the Battle of Shiloh in 1862 Putnam was still a Paymaster, and {{distributed}} pay to the soldiers as they arrived at Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River, up until April 5, the day before the fighting began. When the battle commenced Putman boarded a steam boat and was then invited by General Grant to join him on the field as his aide. He was present and heard General Grant instruct Captain Baxter to set <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> General Wallace, who was expected to be present, and to relay verbal orders to Wallace to bring his division up. This is when Wallace declined the orders insisting that they be written, resulting in his division being absent during battle. Controversy exists as to whether this allowed the Confederates to prevail resulting in a Union retreat {{on the first day of}} the battle.. That evening, after the battle and the costly Union retreat, Putnam claims that Grant had remained [...] "cool and collected as if all were going as he had planned".|$|E

While stating that he would have preferred that the player stayed, he said that the club had to respect McManaman's decision to exercise his right to leave at the end of his contract. Houllier said, [...] "It wasn't unexpected. Steve had always maintained that he wanted to move abroad and I have to respect that... Emotionally we will miss him because he's a Liverpool lad, and needless to say as a player you can't fault him because he has immense ability... I will have to replace him, it's my job to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> another Steve McManaman." ...|$|E

2500|$|One legend told {{among the}} Delaware Indians {{describes}} {{the discovery of}} a fragment of bone left by a monster that had once been killing people near modern Philadelphia in either Pennsylvania or eastern New Jersey. When the hunting party brought the piece of bone back to the village, a wise man encouraged them to set <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> more of the monsters remains. He said that smoking fragments of the bone with tobacco in a small clay spoon could grant wishes like good health for one's children, longevity, or successful hunting. Fossils of the mosasaur Tylosaurus have been found in the area, but dinosaurs and Cretaceous crocodiles are also possible sources. This legend likely predates European contact and may have originated prior to 1500. The bones being burnt in the [...] "clay spoon" [...] is a reference to a primitive kind of clay pipe that the local people had abandoned in favor of a design with a deeper bowl by the 17th century. The general lack of any sign of influence by European culture on the tale is also suggestive of its great antiquity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Crews {{joined the}} UC Berkeley English Department, where he taught for 36 years before {{retiring}} as its chair in 1994. Crews was an anti-war activist from 1965 to about 1970 and advocated draft resistance as co-chair of Berkeley’s Faculty Peace Committee. Though he shared the widespread assumption during the mid-1960s that psychoanalytic theory was a valid account of human motivation {{and was one}} of the first academics to apply that theory systematically to the study of literature, Crews gradually came to regard psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience. This convinced him that his loyalty should not belong to any theory but rather to empirical standards and the skeptical point of view. Throughout his career, Crews has brought his concern for rational discourse to the study of various issues, from the controversy over recovered memory, the credibility of the Rorschach test, and belief in alien abductions to the Theosophical Society, creationism, and “intelligent design.” He has also advocated for clear writing based on standards of sound argument and rhetorical effectiveness rather than adherence to rigid school-book rules. “What interests me is general rationality,” said Crews,General rationality requires us to observe the world carefully, to consider alternative hypotheses to our own hypotheses, to gather evidence in a responsible way, to answer objections. These are habits of mind that science shares with good history, good sociology, good political science, good economics, what have you. And I summarize all this in what I call the [...] "empirical attitude." [...] It's a combination of feeling responsible to the evidence that is available, feeling responsible to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>find</b> that evidence, including the evidence that is contrary to one's presumptions, and responsibility to be logical with one's self and others. And this is an ideal that is not so much individual as social. The rational attitude doesn't really work when simply applied to one's self. It is something that we owe to each other.|$|E
