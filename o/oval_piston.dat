5000|$|The Honda NR (New Racing) was a V-four {{motorcycle}} series {{started by}} Honda in 1979 with the 500cc NR500 Grand Prix racer that used oval pistons. [...] This was followed during the 1980s by a 750cc endurance racer version {{known as the}} NR750. The <b>oval</b> <b>piston</b> concept allowed for eight valves per cylinder which generated more power due to the increased air/fuel mixture throughput and compression. In 1992 Honda produced around 300 street versions of a 750cc model, the NR (often mistakenly {{referred to as the}} NR750), with a 90-degree V angle. Whereas the NR500 had used an <b>oval</b> <b>piston</b> with straight sides, the road going NR750 used an elliptical piston with curved long sides. The bike became the most expensive production bike at the time when it was selling for $50,000 and with the rarity, nowadays they rarely change hands.|$|E

50|$|Honda {{released}} the NR750 in 1992. The bike had a 750 cc V4 with <b>oval</b> <b>pistons,</b> utilising 8 valves per cylinder and 2 conrods per piston; the design allowed {{the engine to}} meet FIM racing regulations {{limiting the number of}} cylinders to 4, while providing the valve area (and therefore increased efficiency) of a V8.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oval</b> <b>piston</b> concept {{continued}} in the NR750 endurance bike, which made a brief appearance during the 1980s. Finally the technology {{was transferred to the}} road, at least on a limited basis, with the bike simply referred to as the 'NR'. One of the most expensive road motorcycles yet offered for sale, a limited number of the NR models was sold in 1992 with a 750cc version of the engine capable of developing approximately 125 bhp at 14,000 rpm in standard form. Although a heavy machine by modern standards, it incorporated a range of technologies and design features that have now appeared on more common models.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve this}} aim Honda could have looked {{to follow their}} 1960's {{practice}} of {{increasing the number of}} cylinders to produce more power. However, Grand Prix rules at the time required a configuration with maximum of four combustion chambers. Honda engineers therefore came up with the highly innovative solution of constructing a 'V8' engine {{in the form of a}} four-cylinder. This was achieved by designing an <b>oval</b> <b>piston</b> that allowed a total of 8 valves per cylinder, and connecting two con-rods to each piston. Such a configuration led to almost unprecedented complexity in terms of engine design, with 32 valves and eight con-rods incorporated into the dimensions of a regular four-cylinder motorcycle engine.|$|E
