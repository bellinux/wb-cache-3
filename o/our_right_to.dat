25|$|Massada, {{for all its}} heroism, was a {{disaster}} in our history; It is not our purpose or <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> plunge to destruction in order to bequeath a legend of martyrdom to posterity; Zionism was to {{mark the end of}} our glorious deaths and {{the beginning of a new}} path leading to life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} 6 months we've seen that {{government}} agencies, namely the NSA and GCHQ and others, have broken laws and twisted legal interpretations {{to create an}} infrastructure of mass surveillance {{of all of us}} online. This creates a dark form of censorship as people become afraid to speak freely -- and it's one that undermines our security and <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy as well. As users of the Internet, {{we have a responsibility to}} defend its freedom.|$|E

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{took three}} major new {{initiatives}} {{in the face}} of these challenges. [...] "Ethics Technology" [...] was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to [...] "disconnect" [...] from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or [...] "suppressive". According to church-operated websites, “A person who disconnects is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person." [...] Hubbard stated: “Communication, however, is a two-way flow. If one has the right to communicate, then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another. It is this latter corollary of the right to communicate that gives us <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy.” Scientologists were also required to write [...] "Knowledge Reports" [...] on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable [...] "Misdemeanors", [...] "Crimes", and [...] "High Crimes". The [...] "Fair Game" [...] policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an [...] "enemy" [...] of Scientology: [...] "May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E

500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E

2500|$|An {{interview}} with David Cameron conducted by John Humphrys in 2006 received 200 complaints concerning Humphrys' aggressive approach and [...] "excessive" [...] interruptions. Ceri Thomas became the programme's editor shortly afterwards, and {{was asked about}} this issue. [...] "I'm not going {{to rule out the}} confrontational interview as it is on occasion necessary... ll the evidence we've got shows that the audience is overwhelmingly behind John Humphrys in general and support <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> do [...] kind of interviews." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the CSKT renewed {{negotiations}} over the NBR. Fish and Wildlife officials in Denver stated {{at the time}} that Burns had the authority to stop the management transfer.

2500|$|After {{the assault}} on Dr. King by the white {{supremacist}} in January, black nationalist leader Malcolm X had sent an open telegram to George Lincoln Rockwell, stating: [...] "if your present racist agitation against our people there in Alabama causes physical harm…you and your KKK friends will be met with maximum physical retaliation from {{those of us who}} ... believe in asserting <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> self-defense-by any means necessary." [...] Fay Bellamy and Silas Norman attended a talk by Malcolm X to 3,000 students at the Tuskegee Institute, and invited him to address a mass meeting at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church to kick off the protests on the morning of February 4.|$|E
2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} Anderson's partial {{ownership of}} the Yes trademark, Yes warned of potential confusion for ticket-buyers created by the concurrent promotion of their newly named line-up through its use of the Yes name. Anderson has said of the name-change: [...] "The fans want it, we want it and it's <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use the name". Of Yes, Anderson said, [...] "we don't like them", while Wakeman said, [...] "we {{have no interest in}} what they do." [...] The forewarned confusion is highlighted in recent press references to the two groups as [...] "two versions", [...] "two factions" [...] or [...] "two incarnations of Yes," [...] and in one local media outlet, where their tours overlap, who states that [...] "Yes is coming... Twice." ...|$|E

"I will acknowledge, Admiral Bluewater," [...] {{returned}} Parker, earnestly, [...] "that {{it would}} be peculiarly grateful to receive some mark of the approbation of my sovereign; principally on account of my dear wife and children.

2500|$|... "Before {{we go on}} the {{offensive}} politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland {{without being able to}} justify <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim {{that we are going to}} escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the June 2012 {{killing of}} {{high-ranking}} al Qaeda figure Abu Yahya al-Libi {{in one of}} the U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, Clinton defended the action, saying [...] "We will always maintain <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use force against groups such as al Qaeda that have attacked us and still threaten us with imminent attack. In doing so, we will comply with the applicable law, including the laws of war, and go to extraordinary lengths to ensure precision and avoid the loss of innocent life." [...] Indeed, beginning with her 2009 trip to Pakistan, Clinton had faced questions about U.S. drone strikes, which she refused to comment much upon at the time. Behind the scenes, Clinton was in fact one of the leading administration proponents of continuing and expanding the strikes there and elsewhere. She did, however, side with U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter in 2011 when he requested more input into, and control over, the U.S. [...] "kill list" [...] selections for that country.|$|E
2500|$|On April 30, 2001, Wolfson left Lambda to form Freedom to Marry with a [...] "very generous" [...] {{grant from}} the Evelyn & Walter Haas Jr. Fund. [...] Wolfson {{described}} the breadth of his vision for the new organization: [...] "I'm not in this just to change the law. It's about changing society. I want gay kids to grow up believing {{that they can get}} married, that they can join the Scouts, that they can choose the life they want to live." [...] Lambda executive director Kevin Cathcart said that over twelve years Wolfson had [...] "personified Lambda's passion and vision for equality." [...] Kate Kendall, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said of her experience with Wolfson at Lambda: [...] "What I can now say is that, in the intervening years, what has been made unmistakably clear to me by the lesbians and gay men that we work with and represent, is that the denial of <b>our</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> marry exacerbates our marginalization; winning that right is the cornerstone of full justice." ...|$|E
