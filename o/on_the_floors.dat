5|$|The {{accommodation}} {{and other}} facilities are {{on the south side}} of the castle. On the ground floor, the entrance to the castle leads through to a courtyard, linked to four barrel-vaulted rooms in the south-west corner, originally 17th-century lodgings for the garrison. Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place. In the south-east corner is the Master Gunner's House, comprising a parlour, hall and kitchen on the ground floor, and a chamber and attic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> above. The parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen; the chamber would also have been subdivided. On the first floor is a small chamber, supported on arches above the courtyard, which was used as a lodging. On the second floor, the Long Room runs on top of the barrel-vaulted chambers, its massive, original roof still intact.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} terrain {{observed on}} Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas {{that must have}} formed {{over a long period}} of time, judging by their varying levels of cratering. The plains are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, with solid ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an efficient localization scheme for an indoor mobile robot using RFID’s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> mobile robot carries an RFID reader at the bottom, which reads <b>the</b> RFID’s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to localize <b>the</b> mobile robot. Each RFID <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> stores its own absolute position {{which is used}} to calculate the position and velocity of the mobile robot. Locating <b>the</b> RFID’s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> which constructs an intelligent sensor space, may require several factors to be considered: economics, feasibility, and accuracy. In this paper, the optimal allocation scheme of <b>the</b> RFID’s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> to satisfy <b>the</b> accuracy constraint has been proposed and verified by <b>the</b> experiments. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RFID reading, the mobile robot navigation has been successfully demonstrated to avoid obstacles and to reach the goal within a pre-specified time...|$|R

25|$|Intermediate plains {{material}} has a roughness and crater density transitional between intercrater plains material and smooth plains material. In the Borealis region, the unit {{occurs in a}} rather extensive belt that extends from the Shakespeare quadrangle into Borealis north and northeast of Suisei Planitia. Intermediate plains material was first recognized and mapped in the Tolstoj quadrangle (Schaber and McCauley, 1980), where it primarily occurs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of craters. It was identified there by a lower crater density than that of intercrater plains material and by “a lower incidence of small bright-halo craters than are found on the smooth plains material” (Schaber and McCauley, 1980). Both characteristics are also typical of intermediate plains material in the Borealis region.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate plains {{material}} is less abundant than the intercrater plains unit {{and has a}} density of superposed small craters that is intermediate between those of the intercrater plains and smooth plains units. The intermediate plains {{material is}} most readily mapped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of those c1, c2, and c3 craters and basins that are surrounded by intercrater plains material with a distinctly higher crater density (FDS 27428). Contacts between intercrater plains and intermediate plains units that occur outside mapped craters and basins are gradational and uncertain. In parts of the quadrangle, photographic resolution and lighting do not permit the intermediate plains unit {{to be separated from}} the intercrater plains or smooth plains units {{with a high level of}} confidence.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{microbial}} mats {{began to}} produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free oxygen is a vital component. At {{around the same time}} they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, of which all multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> of the deep oceans.|$|E
