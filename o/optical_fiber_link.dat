Almost all of voice and data (internet) traffic is routed through terrestrial and submarine <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>links,</b> connecting the world together. Invention of the optical amplifiers (OAs) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology enabled very high capacity <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> communication <b>links</b> that run for thousands of kilometers without any electronic repeaters, {{but at the same time}} brought many design challenges.

We {{show that in}} long-haul fiber optics communications, LDPC-coded OFDM increases spectral efficiency, and reduces the influence of residual chromatic dispersion {{and the influence of}} fiber nonlinearities. LDPC-coded OFDM is as also a promising polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) compensation technique. In free space optical communications, LDPC-coded OFDM improves the immunity to the atmospheric turbulence; while in multimode <b>fiber</b> <b>links,</b> it reduces the influence of intermodal dispersion.
