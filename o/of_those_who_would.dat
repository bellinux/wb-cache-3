Park Wood was sold for £28,100, with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included {{as a gift to}} the people of Ruislip. King's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued that many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council.

5|$|The {{protection}} of Manor Farm {{and the local}} woods from redevelopment was eventually confirmed in January 1930, after a visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were selected, along with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods, part of the centre of the manor of Ruislip along with Ruislip village square, were included when King's College sold the land to the district in February 1931.

25|$|Existing {{patients}} are often discharged without sufficient preparation or support. A {{greater proportion of}} people with mental disorders become homeless or go to prison. Families can often {{play a crucial role}} in the care <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.|$|E
25|$|A legend grew {{that while}} the {{artillery}} was being prepared in Edinburgh before the battle, a demon called Plotcock had read out the names <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be killed at the Mercat Cross on the Royal Mile.

Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 lei (approx. 9,000 United States dollars) for praising Ceaușescu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (3TV Oltenia). Nevertheless, according to opinion polls held in 2010, 41% of Romanians would vote for Ceaușescu and 63% think that their lives were better before 1989.

25|$|The {{two largest}} {{powers in the}} Sixth Seimas had vastly {{different}} views on how the land reform should take place. Sąjūdis (and Homeland Union that emerged from it) focused on returning the agricultural land to those that had lost it in the waves of Soviet collectivization and implemented it as a policy when in power before 1992. LDDP, on the other hand, prioritized maintaining the existing levels of production, which meant ensuring that the land stays in the hands <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> work it most efficiently. Once in power, LDDP introduced changes to the Law on Land Reform, slowing down the process of restitution and limiting its scope.|$|E
25|$|Up to {{two million}} people may have visited Tiananmen Square on 4 April. First-hand {{observations}} of the events in Tiananmen Square on 4 April report that all levels of society, from the poorest peasants to high-ranking PLA officers {{and the children of}} high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against Mao and his policies, apprehension for China's future, and defiance <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> seek to punish the public for commemorating Zhou's memory. There is nothing to suggest that events were coordinated from any position of leadership: it was a spontaneous demonstration reflecting widespread public sentiment. Deng Xiaoping was notably absent, and he instructed his children to avoid being seen at the square.|$|E

25|$|Dominic's {{health was}} {{steadily}} deteriorating, but {{he spent most}} of his time with his friends, talking with them, and encouraging those who were experiencing troubles. He also helped at the school infirmary whenever his companions were admitted. On the recommendation of doctors, Dominic was sent home to recover from his ill health, but a few days later Bosco found him back at the Oratory. Despite his affection for Dominic, and his wish to allow Dominic to remain at the Oratory, John Bosco decided to follow the recommendation of the doctors, especially since Dominic had developed a severe cough and he wrote to Dominic's father, fixing the date of his departure on March 1, 1857. Though Dominic said that he wanted to spend his last days at the Oratory, he accepted this decision and spent the evening before his departure at John Bosco's side, discussing spiritual matters. (Bosco recorded a part of this conversation in his biography of Dominic). On the morning of his departure, Don Bosco notes that Dominic made the Exercise of a Happy Death with great zeal, even saying that this would be his final such devotion. He said his farewell to John Bosco, asking as a keepsake that Bosco add his name to the list <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> participate in the Plenary Indulgence that John Bosco had received from the Pope, to which John Bosco readily agreed. He then took leave of his friends with great affection, which surprised them, for his illness was not considered by many of his companions to be serious.|$|E

The Ordinance stated that the Virginians [...] "shall have their possessions and titles confirmed to them, and be protected in the enjoyment of their rights and liberties." [...] Many decided to keep slaves. Fear of French rebellion kept the courts from acting against slavery, as did the violent actions <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> kidnap escaped slaves. A court ruling [...] in the Michigan Territory in 1807 stated that preexisting slavery could still exist under the Northwest Ordinance, validated Hoosier slaveholding in {{the opinions of the}} slaveholders.|$|E

[...] "The BBC is producing producers as well as plays. They are feeling their way towards what television drama will one day be, and we are trying to create a generation of writers who study the medium." [...] His 1994 obituary in the same newspaper judged that he had been successful in creating a lasting influence on later producers, describing his 1962 production of the opera Carmen as [...] "an example and inspiration to a younger generation of television producers".|$|E

500|$|Continental forces, {{partly in}} {{response}} to the Grape Island incident, worked to clear the harbor islands of livestock and supplies useful to the British. [...] On May 27, in the Battle of Chelsea Creek, the British Marines attempted to stop removal of livestock from some of the islands. [...] The Americans resisted, and, {{in the course of the}} action, the British schooner Diana ran aground and was destroyed, but not before the Continentals recovered its weaponry. In an attempt to help quell the rebellion, Gage issued a proclamation on June 12 offering to pardon all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> lay down their arms, with the exception of John Hancock and Samuel Adams.

500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E
500|$|The book {{generally}} received positive reception from literature critics. Publishers Weekly {{described it}} as [...] "golden SF from the Golden Age", and The Harvard Crimson called it [...] "one of the great classics" [...] of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. A reviewer writing in Publishers Weekly commented: [...] "Hubbard brilliantly evokes the vastness of space and the tragedy <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> conquer it", and called the book [...] "one of his [...] finest works". Alan Cheuse reviewed the book in the San Francisco Chronicle, writing: [...] "As {{in a number of}} groundbreaking -- or time-breaking, I suppose we ought to say -- works of science fiction, the science behind the story is more interesting than the fiction itself. Hubbard is a thinker who writes, rather than a writer who thinks, as most masters are." [...] Cheuse highlighted the book among his 2004 literature holiday picks in a piece for National Public Radio's program All Things Considered: [...] "Before he began founding new religions, Hubbard was one of the country's most prolific pulp science fiction writers, and this book is one of his best." [...] Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes [...] "besides being among the earliest hard science fiction works to consider time-dilation effects in long distance near-light-speed space travel, (To The Stars) is a pretty entertaining story." ...|$|E

500|$|Devra G. Kleiman {{reviewed}} {{the work for}} Signs. She called it [...] "a remarkable attempt to explain the evolution of social behavior and social systems in animals by a synthesis of several disciplines within biology", but noted {{that it had been}} severely criticised by some biologists and social scientists. She observed that [...] "it gives less attention to the environmental control of behavior" [...] than to genetics. But [...] "Wilson's ultimate sin" [...] was to include the final chapter, [...] "unfortunately titled 'Man'", attracting [...] "the wrath <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> deny the influence of biology on human behavior because of its political and social connotations." [...] She called this a pity, since while his attempt to include humans in his analysis was [...] "admittedly weak and premature", the general principles were correct – for instance, she argued, it was useful to know the genetic relatedness of individuals when assessing social interactions. She considered Wilson [...] "nonrigorous and biased in his application of theory in certain areas". His biases included over-representation of insects, genetics, and the dominance of male mammals over females: Wilson had further exaggerated a bias from an ethology literature written mainly by males. Conversely, he had undervalued co-operative behaviour among mammals, except where it concerned males, ignoring the fact that, Kleiman argued, genetically related females were the core of most mammal societies. Wilson's book was in her view valuable as a framework for future research, but premature as a [...] "Synthesis".|$|E
