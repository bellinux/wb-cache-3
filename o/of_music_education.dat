5|$|From a young age, Imogen Holst showed {{precocious}} {{talent in}} composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, {{she entered the}} Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable for health reasons to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer, Imogen {{spent most of the}} 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts {{at the start of the}} Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>education</b> and activity.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Lucia School of Music is an {{independent}} institute <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>education</b> that has two branches on the island, one {{in the north and}} one in the south. It was established in 1987, and has a student body of around four hundred students. The School's professed goal is to provide music education at all levels, to offer community opportunities for musical enrichment, to facilitate the training and professional development of educators, and to establish the school as a musical resource. There is also a notable music Education Centre operated by a vocal group from the fishing village Anse la Raye; this Centre provides music education opportunities for gifted and underprivileged children from across the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Americans like William Billings were {{establishing}} a bold, new style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore {{was home to}} other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using a broad array <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>education</b> techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived {{from the work of}} Heinrich Pestalozzi, interpreted by the American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system.|$|E

50|$|The rise of {{technologies}} {{leading to the}} development <b>of</b> online <b>music</b> <b>education</b> is well documented, and such studies have become particularly popular in the United States in recent years (Schlager, 2008; Webster, 2007).

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the century, touring and {{community}} concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>education</b> in the public school system, high school and university marching bands and concert bands became ubiquitous in the US.

40|$|Music {{therapists}} acknowledge inherent {{qualities in}} musical experiences that enable therapeutic growth {{to take place}} in their clients, {{within the context of a}} therapeutic relationship. Equipped with the belief that these basic tenets <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy hold tremendous relevance to <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> and inspired by a recent experience of profound personal growth through my voice instruction at the university level, I sought to investigate the concept <b>of</b> therapeutic <b>music</b> <b>education.</b> Defined as an educational setting in which the educator adopts and adapts facets <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy, within therapeutic <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> the boundaries between music therapy and <b>music</b> <b>education</b> are blurred. This qualitative, phenomenological study drew upon data analysis techniques and methods from grounded theory and first-person research. Through interviews with university music educators and university music students, as well as through the writing of my own reflective narrative, I explored educators’ philosophies and students’ experiences <b>of</b> therapeutic <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> seeking the essence <b>of</b> therapeutic <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> and its potential links to music therapy. A model <b>of</b> therapeutic <b>music</b> <b>education</b> with three main components, teacher’s awareness, music as medium, and student’s personal growth, emerged from the data. Within this model, there lies potential for a parallel process between the student’s musical and personal growth to unfold, a process contingent upon the presence of an educator who holds a holistic awareness of each individual and recognizes the unique qualities within musical experiences. From this model <b>of</b> therapeutic <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> parallels and links to music therapy are uncovered and discussed, and possibilities for future research and collaboration between the fields are considered. In particular, “music for music’s sake” advocacy within <b>music</b> <b>education</b> is paralleled with “music-centred” philosophy in music therapy. The stories shared by the participants present the notion that musical growth and personal growth are inextricably linked, and that musical development has a profound impact on the realization of human potential. If this is true, then the implications for both the fields <b>of</b> <b>music</b> therapy and <b>music</b> <b>education</b> are limitless, as are the possibilities for connection and dialogue between the fields...|$|R
25|$|Singing can be {{formal or}} informal, {{arranged}} or improvised. It may be {{done as a}} form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual, as part <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.|$|E

40|$|The {{awareness}} of the importance <b>of</b> multicultural <b>music</b> in the Malaysian primary <b>music</b> <b>education</b> has increased due to the requirements set by the National Curriculum Standards for Primary School in <b>music</b> <b>education</b> in Malaysia. Therefore, {{it can be said}} that multicultural music is not an optional component to be included or disregarded at the discretion of the teacher in the music classroom. Music teachers are expected to foster multicultural music educational programs that address the diverse needs of students. in the context of sustainability <b>of</b> multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> it is important to know that the current status <b>of</b> <b>music</b> teachers’ attitudes and practices with regard to multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education</b> such as what and how effective are the practices and their perceptions as far as the multicultural music is concerned. Therefore, this study examined Malaysian general <b>music</b> teachers’ utilization <b>of</b> multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education</b> in the <b>music</b> curriculum, specifically exploring the relationship between the general music teachers’ attitudes and their efforts in developing and implementing multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education</b> in <b>music</b> classes. This study utilized an adaptation <b>of</b> the original <b>Music</b> Specialist’s Multicultural <b>Music</b> <b>Education</b> Survey instrument which was administered to 456 of primary schools’ general music teachers in Malaysia. This instrument was used to measure teachers’ attitudes and practices regarding multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education.</b> Data analysis included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlational analysis (pearson product-moment correlation). Results indicate that there is limited implementation <b>of</b> multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education</b> in the <b>music</b> classrooms due to inadequate preparation and limited resources, and insufficient knowledge in multicultural music. As such, it is important to ensure music teachers develop a more critical understanding <b>of</b> multicultural <b>music</b> <b>education</b> include producing and developing more instructional materials and learning aids, which are suitable for primary students and appropriate for the Malaysian context.
