40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the first successful}} attempt to detect wake vortices axially using an on-board infrared pulsed Doppler LiDAR. On-board axial detection {{is more complex than}} the classic ground-based tangential approach, because the axial air speed in vortices is low and the atmospheric particle density is reduced, yielding a poorer SNR. To provide meaningful results in such unfavorable conditions we have developed a new flexible signal processing method based on a two-primitive model fitting the spectrum of the Doppler return. This new spectral estimation successfully detects wake vortices with an admissible SNR that is lower than <b>other</b> <b>on-board</b> state-of-the-art approaches.
