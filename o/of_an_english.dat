5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama.

Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{was born}} December 19, 1869, {{on a farm}} near Osceola, Missouri. The family surname came from French {{ancestors}} who had been granted the hereditary title of Marquis.

With no prospects in France, he emigrated to Virginia, where he took Marquis as a surname.|$|E

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry—formed unseen behind the ridge—to charge {{in support of}} the hard-pressed infantry.

The 2nd Brigade, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, was so called as it consisted <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English,</b> the 1st (The Royals); a Scottish, 2nd ('Scots Greys'); and an Irish, 6th (Inniskilling); regiment of heavy dragoons.|$|E

5|$|Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27February 1903, Lester Brain was {{the second}} son <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> mining {{engineer}} and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie. Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia. By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age. He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.|$|E
5|$|During the 1550s, Henry II became {{concerned}} about the threat <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> or Holy Roman Empire attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response. The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. A bastion, a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional protective fire for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone abutment using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|E

5|$|However, {{when the}} king's uncle, Odo of Bayeux, raised a {{rebellion}} against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later put him on trial for treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to Normandy, where he became a leading advisor to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.|$|E
5|$|In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded her {{half-sister}} to {{the throne}} {{and set out to}} rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line. She never did, despite numerous courtships. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1909, Alice, wanting her sons to have an English education, {{accompanied}} them to England and enrolled them in Dunstable Grammar School in Bedfordshire, where Cooper was educated from 1910 to 1912. At Dunstable, Cooper studied Latin and French, and took several courses in English history. While he managed {{to adapt to the}} discipline <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> school and learned the requisite social graces, he never adjusted to the rigid class structure and formal Eton collars he was forced to wear. After completing confirmation classes, Cooper was baptized into the Anglican Church on December 3, 1911, at the Church of All Saints in Houghton Regis. Cooper's mother accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912, and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.|$|E
