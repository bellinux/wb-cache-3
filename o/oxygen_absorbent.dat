40|$|A {{new process}} which {{combines}} oxygen permeable membrane with <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> was proposed to simultaneously produce pure oxygen and nitrogen from air. In the process, air is fed in the oxygen permeable membrane, {{and a large}} part of oxygen permeates through the membrane. Then, the oxygen-depleted air (similar to 7 % O- 2) passes through an oxygen absorption bed to make the residual oxygen absorbed; simultaneously, pure nitrogen is produced at the exit of the absorption bed. After the absorption bed reaches its saturated capacity, the oxygen-depleted air pass through another absorption bed switched by an automatic 3 -way valve; {{at the same time the}} saturated absorption bed is under a desorption process by vacuum to renew the absorption capacity. The pumped out oxygen has a high-purity due to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> is 100 % selectivity to oxygen. As a result, nearly 100 % recoveries of oxygen and nitrogen, and > 99. 4 % oxygen purity and > 99. 0 % nitrogen purity was achieved simultaneously. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In this research, three {{alternative}} approaches to chemical preservatives {{to extend the}} mold free shelf-life and quality of pita bread were investigated namely: Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) involving gas packaging, oxygen absorbents technology and ethanol vapor generators, high pressures, and direct and indirect heating. Gas packaging using 60 %CO 2 (balance N 2) inhibited the growth of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum from 3 d (pita bread packaged in air) to 35 d at ambient temperature. A longer extension in shelf-life (42 d) was possible using an Ageless <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> or a Freshmax <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> label in conjunction with gas packaging. Similar results were obtained with 2 G [...] 4 G sachets of Ethicap, and 100 [...] 200 S sachets of Negamold, a dual functional oxygen absorbent-ethanol vapor generator. High pressures (30 [...] 400 MPa) used to inhibit mold growth, resulted in delamination of the packaging film and textural changes to the pita bread. Other alternatives, such as direct heating and microwave processing had a minimal effect in increasing the shelf-life of pita bread. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a chemisorption compressor cryogenic refrigerator which employs oxygen to provide cooling at 60 to 100 K. The invention includes dual vessels containing an <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> material, alternately heated and cooled {{to provide a}} continuous flow of high pressure oxygen, multiple heat exchangers for precooling the oxygen, a Joule-Thomson expansion valve system for expanding the oxygen to partially liquefy it and a liquid oxygen pressure vessel. The primary novelty is that, while {{it was believed that}} once oxygen combined with an element or compound the reaction could not reverse to release gaseous oxygen, in this case oxygen will indeed react in a reversible fashion with certain materials and will do so at temperatures and pressures which make it practical for incorporation into a cryogenic refrigeration system...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of {{spoilage}} mold {{of common}} contaminant of bakery goods in modal agar system by potassium sorbate and calcium propionate in {{wide range of}} concentration (0 - 2000 ppm) at different pH (5. 5 - 7) was investigated. All Sam-ples were examined daily for mold growth. Results showed that both potassium sorbate and calcium propionate can be used effectively to inhibit mold growth {{and the effectiveness of}} these preservatives is enhanced by increasing the con-centration and decreasing the pH. The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) comprised of 60 % or 80 % CO 2 (balance N 2) and <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbents</b> on the growth of mold was also studied on the agar system. The results indicated that mold growth was prevented up to 42 days in packs flushed with 60 % or 80 % CO 2 (balance N 2).

40|$|Associated {{bacteria}} {{living on}} macroalgae surfaces {{are an interesting}} source of new secondary metabolites with biological activities. The {{aim of this study}} was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine algae Sphaerococcus coronopifolius and the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1 : 1) extraction. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and <b>oxygen</b> radical <b>absorbent</b> capacity (ORAC). The extracts with higher antioxidant activity were tested on MCF- 7 and HepG- 2 cell lines in oxidative stress conditions induced by H 2 O 2 at 0. 2 mM and 0. 5 mM, respectively. In total were isolated 21 Sphaerococcus coronopifolius associated bacteria and identified as Vibrio sp. (28. 57 %), Shewanella sp. (23. 81 %), Pseudoalteromonas sp. (19. 05 %), Bacillus sp. (9. 52 %) and Halomonas sp. (9. 52 %). Two (9. 52 %) of them presented less than 90 % Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match. The epiphytic bacteria with the most antioxidant potential evaluated by ORAC and DPPH methods were Sp 2, Sp 12, Sp 23, Sp 25 and Sp 27. The strain Sp 4 show high antioxidant activity in all antioxidant methods (ORAC, DPPH and TPC). In oxidative stress conditions on MCF- 7 cell line, the extracts of bacteria (1 mg. ml- 1 : 24 hours) Sp 4 (16. 15 %), Sp 25 (17. 95 %) and Sp 27 (10. 65 %) prevented the cell death induced by H 2 O 2. In the HepG- 2 cell line was the extracts of Sp 2 (9. 01 %), Sp 4 (11. 21 %), Sp 12 (7. 20 %) and Sp 23 (8. 81 %) bacteria that high prevented the oxidative stress condition induced by H 2 O 2. In conclusion, the Sphaerococcus coronopifolius associated bacteria can be an interesting and excellent source of marine natural compounds with antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) involving gas packaging, <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> {{and other environmental}} factors to control aflatoxin production by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus in both synthetic media and peanuts were studied using a process optimization technique termed Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Regression {{analysis of the data}} indicated that water activity (a$ sb{ rm w}$), pH, storage temperature, initial concentration of headspace oxygen and inoculum level were all highly significant factors (p 0 %). These changes in the barrier characteristics influenced the headspace gas composition within the product and under modified atmospheres hence the level of aflatoxin detected in these stored products. In conclusion, this study has shown that the combined effect of several "barriers" can be used in conjunction with low oxygen modified atmosphere and high barrier packaging films to inhibit or reduce aflatoxin to safe and acceptable levels, particularly at abusive temperatures encountered during storage...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enteritidis has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} potential pathogen in poultry products. The growth of S. enteritidis in poultry is affected by several factors such as storage temperature, pH, water activity, modified atmosphere {{and the presence of}} preservatives. All of these factors may act alone or in combination with each other resulting in a synergistic, antimicrobial effect. In this research, initial storage studies were done to determine the effect of various atmospheres (air, vacuum, <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> and gas packaging) on the microbial changes of packaged chicken thighs followed by challenge studies with a strain of S. enteritidis$ sp{ rm{NAST}}$. Chicken thighs were packaged in Cryovac bags and stored at 4 and 12 $ sp circ$C for up to 28 d. Changes in headspace gas composition, pH, drip loss, color and odor were monitored at each sampling day. The effect of various packaging treatments, dipping solutions (chitosan (0. 2 %w/v) and potassium sorbate (0. 2 %w/v)) and low dose irradiation (1. 5 & 3. 0 kGy) on the growth of S. enteritidis$ sp{ rm NAST}$ and on the shelf-life of chicken thighs stored at 4 and 12 $ sp circ$C was also investigated.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} films of various gas barrier properties, various gas packaging atmospheres (air, vacuum and gas packaging, oxygen absorbents) and storage temperatures (4 and 12 $ sp circ$C) were investigated {{on the color}} stability and shelf-life of fresh beef. Meat color was described by reflectance measurements and by reading the color coordinates L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness), C* (chroma) and h (hue angle) in the CIE-LAB system. All packaged beef was regarded as unacceptable when reflectance differences values at 630 and 580 nm i. e., due to oxymyoglobin (MbO$ sb 2) $ were $ sim$ 30 - 35. Based on these standards, aerobic packaging of beef in polyvinylchloride (PVC) film had a shelf-life of $ sim$ 5 d and 1 d at 4 and 12 $ sp circ$C respectively. Beef packaged in both low gas-moisture barrier films resulted in black discoloration after only 2 d at 4 $ sp circ$C due to increased moisture loss. Longer extensions in both color and microbial shelf-life of fresh beef were possible by packaging products under modified atmospheres using high gas barrier Cryovac$ sp circler$ bags. Both vacuum packaging (VP) and vacuum skin packaging (VSP) resulted in a shelf-life of $ sim$ 35 d at 4 $ sp circ$C. Gas packaging using high levels of CO$ sb 2 $ (100 %) in conjunction with Ageless-SS$ sp circler$ <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent,</b> delayed discoloration for $ sim$ 42 d at 4 $ sp circ$C.

40|$|Formulation {{studies of}} {{value-added}} seafood nuggets were done using appropriate mixtures of surimi, kamaboko, broken shrimp, and shrimp broth made from shrimp processing waste. A total of 19 formulations were prepared and, {{on the basis}} of sensory analysis, two formulations (comprising of 75 % surimi: 25 % shrimp, and 100 % surimi containing shrimp broth) were used throughout this study. Initial storage trials of both raw and cooked battered and breaded value-added nuggets in air and under various modified atmospheres (MAP) showed that a microbiological shelf-life of 28 d was possible for cooked nuggets at 4 and 12 $ sp circ$C packaged under various gas atmospheres, compared to $ sim$ 14 d for raw nuggets stored/packaged under similar conditions. Growth of Listeria monocytogenes occurred in both raw and cooked nuggets at 4 and 12 $ sp circ$C, irrespective of packaging conditions. However, growth of Clostridium botulinum type E was inhibited in both raw and cooked nuggets stored at 4, 12, and 25 $ sp circ$C. While inhibition was suspected to be due to the decrease in pH of raw nuggets to $ sim$ 4. 1 - 4. 5, due to the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), subsequent studies on cooked and sterilized nuggets showed that the anti-botulinum effect was due to heat resistant Bacillus species. Further challenge studies with C. botulinum type E in sterile nuggets (i. e., in the absence of LAB and Bacillus spp.) showed that toxin was produced after 14 and 28 d in nuggets stored in air, and in air with an Ageless SS <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> at 25 and 12 $ sp circ$C, respectively. Further studies have now confirmed that Bacillus isolates, specifically B. subtilis, inhibited the growth of C. botulinum type E...|$|E
40|$|In this research, initial {{studies were}} done to {{determine}} the effect of various methods of presentation involving chemical preservatives, water activity ($ rm a sb{w}$), and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on mold growth in an agar model system. Results showed that preservatives could completely inhibit mold growth for 2 - 40 d depending on concentration and pH used. Gas packaging (60 % or 80 % CO$ sb 2 $), oxygen absorbents, alone or in combination with potassium sorbate, could also inhibit mold growth for $>$ 40 d at ambient storage temperature using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach. The effects of various methods of applying potassium sorbate into pizza crusts via direct incorporation into the batter, surface spraying, and impregnation of packaging material with potassium sorbate to control mold spoilage of pizza crusts were also investigated. Results showed that the antimicrobial effect of potassium sorbate was negligible when the packaging material was impregnated with the inhibitor but more pronounced when it was incorporated directly into the dough or sprayed onto the product's surface. The inhibitory effect of potassium sorbate increased as both the pH and the inoculum level decreased. Shelf life studies using low concentrations of potassium sorbate (1000 and 2000 p. p. m.) and MAP, alone and in combination with each other, showed that potassium sorbate, gas packaging or oxygen absorbents (Ageless FX) could extend the shelf life of pizza crusts and decrease the growth rate of molds, bacteria and yeast. Furthermore, when pizza crusts were packaged in 60 % CO$ sb 2 $ or with an <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent,</b> in combination with potassium sorbate (1000 - 2000 p. p. m.), a shelf life of 42 d was possible without compromising the sensory shelf life of the product.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic, psychrotrophic {{microorganism}} that is {{ubiquitous in}} nature. L. monocytogenes has been isolated from numerous meat products, both fresh and processed, {{the incidence of}} contamination varying greatly. The ability of Listeria to grow in meats depends on temperature, pH, water activity (a$ sb{ rm w}$), nutrients, species and numbers of competing microorganisms, gaseous conditions, and levels of additional barriers. Therefore, methods to control the growth of L. monocytogenes are of great importance to food processors since this organism can grow under {{a wide range of}} environmental and storage conditions. Two methods of control, in conjunction with temperature, were studied in this project: (i) modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and (ii) chitosan, to determine the optimum levels of these "hurdles" needed to effectively control the outgrowth of L. monocytogenes in both model broth and agar systems and in fresh pork loin. On the basis of these preliminary studies, a combination of chitosan as a dipping solution and modified atmosphere packaging were investigated to control the growth of L. monocytogenes in fresh pork loin. Pork loin samples were dipped in a 0. 2 % chitosan solution for 60 seconds and packaged under various atmospheres in Cryovac bags and stored at 5, 10 and 15 $ sp circ$C up to 28 days. Samples were monitored for physical, chemical and microbiological changes throughout the storage period. Optimum control over the growth of L. monocytogenes was achieved using a combination of 100 %N$ sb 2 $ + an Ageless FX <b>oxygen</b> <b>absorbent</b> and dipping in a 0. 2 % chitosan solution. Based on these studies, a combination of 0. 2 % chitosan and MAP could be used to extend the shelf life of pork without adversely affecting color, odor and exudate loss while inhibiting the growth of the pathogenic microorganism, L. monocytogenes.
