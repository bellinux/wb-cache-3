5|$|A {{total of}} 57 genera of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 analysis by the botanical taxonomist David Frodin. The actual numbers <b>of</b> <b>species</b> are imprecisely known, {{as many of the}} genera have not been the subject of recent monographs. For instance, estimates of the number <b>of</b> <b>species</b> in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E
5|$|Several writers {{anticipated}} evolutionary {{aspects of}} Darwin's theory, {{and in the}} third edition of On the Origin <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> published in 1861 Darwin named those he knew about in an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> which he expanded in later editions.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>species</b> are {{adapted to}} {{spending}} {{a portion of}} their time feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground.

50|$|There are {{approximately}} 385 endangered species {{listed in the}} Red Book of Ukraine.

5|$|A {{number of}} subgenera have been {{proposed}} over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number <b>of</b> <b>species</b> in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), {{some of which have}} since been treated as separate genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original number <b>of</b> <b>species</b> of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included as separate sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of clavarioid fungi concluded that R.kunzei is in a phylogenetic lineage together with several Clavulinopsis species (including C.sulcata, C.helvola and C.fusiformis), {{and that this}} clade (the ramariopsis clade) is nested within a group <b>of</b> <b>species</b> representing the Clavariaceae family.|$|E
5|$|After Charles Darwin {{published}} Origin <b>of</b> <b>Species</b> in 1859, much of {{the focus}} of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths, including human evolution, and evolutionary theory.|$|E

5|$|Before 1846, Gray {{had been}} firmly {{opposed to the}} idea of {{transmutation}} <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time, including via hybridization. By the early 1850s, Gray had clearly defined his concept that the species is the basic unit of taxonomy. This was partly the result of the 1831–1836 voyage during which Darwin discovered the differentiation <b>of</b> <b>species</b> among the various Galápagos Islands. Local geography could produce variances, like in the Galápagos and Hawaii, which Gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted. Gray was insistent that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species, that like begat like. This concept was critical to Darwin's theories. Gray was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution.|$|E
5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of On the Origin <b>of</b> <b>Species.</b>|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin <b>of</b> <b>Species,</b> overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
