However, regardless of recent developments, the molecular pathogenesis of CNO/CRMO remains unclear.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Intravenous {{disodium}} pamidronate {{has been}} described {{in the treatment of}} several <b>osteopathies.</b> Although tolerability {{has been found to be}} good in clinical trials, some mild to serious adverse events (AEs) have been reported. Objectives: The aims of this study were to analyze the toelrability of IV pamidronate in patients being treated for osteoporosis and other metabolic <b>osteopathies</b> and to describe particular patients with relative contraindications, because such cases are not commonly seen in daily clinical practice. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with different <b>osteopathies</b> who were administered IV infusions of pamidronate at doses ranging from 15 to 90 mg/infusion and 15 to 900 mg/year. The study was conducted in patients who had received treatment at the Institute of Metabolic Investigations, University of Salvador, Buenos Aires, Argentina, between January 1995 and December 2003. To rule out dose-related AEs, a comparison was made between patients who received fewer IV infusions and had cumulative doses of 120 to 180 mg/y (less frequent administration [LFA] group) and those patients who received regular infusions and had cumulative doses of > 180 mg/year (frequent administration [FA] group). To confirm data obtained from medical records and to assess the occurrence of AEs, attempts were made to interview all patients by phone. The following information was verified for each patient included in the study: the reason for treatment, documented evidence of current diagnostic criteria, and whether the dose administered was adequate to treat the patient's condition. Results: Six hundred eight patients (464 [76. 3 %]women, 144 [23. 7 %]men; mean [SD] age, 69 [10] years) with various <b>osteopathies</b> (osteoporosis, 367 [60. 4 %] of the patients; Paget's disease, 172 [28. 3 %]; Sudeck's disease, 63 [10. 4 %]; multiple myeloma, 3 [0. 5 %]; and bone metastases, 3 [0. 5 %]) were administered a total of 2933 IV infusions of pamidronate during the study period. We were able to confirm the clinical records of 69. 4 % (422 / 608) of the patients by telephone survey; 29. 9 % (124 / 415) of those patients experienced extraskeletal AEs (most commonly fever and flu-like symptoms [eg, headache, malaise, fatigue, chills, and asthenia]). The percentage of patients reporting AEs was significantly higher for the LFA group than that of the FA group (91. 2 vs 19. 5; P 1. 20 mg/dL. Conclusions: Pamidronate administered IV was well tolerated when used for treating osteoporosis or other metabolic <b>osteopathies</b> in our study population. The clinical AEs observed with IV pamidronate administration were not serious and hematologic changes were mild, transient, and not associated with dose, time of treatment, or any particular underlying disease. An increase in sCreat level was the most frequent biochemical complication and was found in patients with additional risk factors for renal failure and particular diseases. Whether certain patients with risk factors for osteoporosis may require even fewer IV administrations of the drug is an issue that remains to be elucidated...|$|R

There is evidence that bisphosphonates may control the activity of Paget's disease as they inhibit the function of osteoclasts. The use of these drugs reduces the intensity of osteoalgia and the level of biochemical markers for bone resorption and osteogenesis and can decelerate or reverse the early osteolytic phase of the disease.

40|$|Paget’s {{disease of}} bone (PDB) is a chronic {{localized}} skeletal disease {{that belongs to}} a group of metabolic <b>osteopathies</b> and is characterized by impaired bone remodeling to form foci of increased bone resorption followed by replacement with an excessive amount of defective, less durable bone that is prone to deformities and pathologic fractures. The course of PDB shows three stages: rarefaction, compaction, and coarse-trabecular remodeling – each of which is characterized by certain clinical, biochemical, and radiological manifestations. The majority of the clinical manifestations of the disease are associated with skeletal injury. The disease is characterized by the appearance of bone and joint pain in case of secondary osteoarthritis, bone deformities, pathological fractures, hearing loss due to damage to the skull bones, etc. In many patients, the disease is asymptomatic and detected incidentally after finding a high serum alkaline phosphatase activity or during bone X-ray for any pathological processes, but it can be diagnosed fairly late in the development of complications, as shown in the clinical examples.

Materials and methods: To obtain a qualitative assessment of edentulous jawbone sections, the results from 2 D-OPG with a defined X-ray density (XrDn), expression of the cytokine RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), and a transalveolar ultrasound system for measuring jawbone density were compared. Results: The difference in the XrDn of healthy jawbone and FDOJ are minimal, whereas RANTES is up to 25 -fold higher in FDOJ. In contrast to 2 D-OPG, transalveolar ultrasound showed coincidental findings in FDOJ areas. Discussion: Comparisons of the data revealed a discrepancy between the XrDn of 2 D-OPGs and the medullary <b>osteopathies</b> in the jawbone like FDOJ. Conclusion: The data suggest that there is a critical attitude toward the use of 2 D-OPG as a sole imaging diagnostic tool for assessing chronic inflammatory processes in the jawbone.

40|$|Methods for imaging of nanocomposites {{based on}} X-ray, electron, {{tunneling}} or force microscopy {{provide information about}} the shapes of nanoparticles; however, all of these methods fail on chemical recognition. Neither do they allow local identification of mineral type. We demonstrate that infrared near-field microscopy solves these requirements at 20 nm spatial resolution, highlighting, in its first application to natural nanostructures, the mineral particles in shell and bone. "Nano-FTIR" spectral images result from Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). On polished sections of Mytilus edulis shells we observe a reproducible vibrational (phonon) resonance within all biocalcite microcrystals, and distinctly different spectra on bioaragonite. Surprisingly, we discover sparse, previously unknown, 20 nm thin nanoparticles with distinctly different spectra that are characteristic of crystalline phosphate. Multicomponent phosphate bands are observed on human tooth sections. These spectra vary characteristically near tubuli in dentin, proving a chemical or structural variation of the apatite nanocrystals. The infrared band strength correlates with the mineral density determined by electron microscopy. Since nano-FTIR sensitively responds to structural disorder it is well suited {{for the study of}} biomineral formation and aging. Generally, nano-FTIR is suitable for the analysis and identification of composite materials in any discipline, from testing during nanofabrication to even the clinical investigation of <b>osteopathies...</b>|$|R

Quantitative ultrasound was recommended for bone mineral density (BMD) screening. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and their ratio are critical for physiological bone remodelling, and related abnormalities may lead to several <b>osteopathies.</b> Methods: The BMD of 499 Saudi females aged 20 to 65 years was measured using quantitative ultrasound from the beginning of October 2013 to the end of March 2014 at the female medical unit of Taibah University, Madinah, KSA. Possible associated risk factors for low BMD were studied. Blood RANKL and OPG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} participants with normal and low BMD regarding the studied risk factors. However, there was {{a significant}} association (p < 0. 05) between BMD and regular physical activity among participants aged 20 years to less than 35 years, and women aged 35 – 50 years with higher body mass index (BMI) had higher BMD.

40|$|Objective - To {{investigate}} if {{adults who}} are hospitalised for a burn injury have increased long-term hospital use for musculoskeletal diseases. Design - A population-based retrospective cohort study using linked administrative health data from the Western Australian Data Linkage System. Subjects - Records of 17, 753 persons aged at least 20 years when hospitalised for a first burn injury in Western Australia during the period 1980 – 2012, and 70, 758 persons who were age and gender-frequency matched with no injury admissions randomly selected from Western Australia's electoral roll. Main outcome measures - Admission rates and cumulative length of stay for musculoskeletal diseases. Negative binomial and Cox proportional hazards regression modelling were used to generate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and HRs with 95 % CIs, respectively. Results - After adjustment for pre-existing health status and demographic characteristics, the burn cohort had almost twice the hospitalisation rate for a musculoskeletal condition (IRR, 95 % CI 1. 98, 1. 86 to 2. 10), and spent 3. 70 times as long in hospital with a musculoskeletal diagnosis (95 % CI 3. 10 to 4. 42) over the 33 -year period, than the uninjured comparison cohort. Adjusted survival analyses of incident post-burn musculoskeletal disease admissions found significant increases for the 15 -year post burn discharge period (0 – 6 months: HR, 95 % CI 2. 51, 2. 04 to 3. 11; 6 months– 2 years: HR, 95 % CI 1. 77, 1. 53 to 2. 05; 2 – 15 years: HR, 95 % CI 1. 32, 1. 23 to 1. 42).

40|$|Bisphosphonates (BP),were {{initially}} used {{in industry}} and later as a drug due to their great affinity to osseous tissue, because of their powerful antiresorptive effect as a treatment in various <b>osteopathies,</b> such as osteoporosis, Paget disease or hypercalcemia associated with some malignant tumors, as myeloma or breast cancer. They are administered orally or intravenously, and although well tolerated, the most frequent side effects are gastrointestinal, in addition to osteonecrosis when they are administered via endovenous. The aim of this work has been to evaluate the existing publications in accredited scientific literature on biphosphonates and their action mechanism and {{the relationship with the}} appearance of osteonecrosis of the jaws. Although the mechanism by which osteonecrosis of the jaws develops is not known exactly, there seems to be influence by osteoclast inhibiton, antiangiogenic action, an inhibitory effect on the cellular cycle by the keratinocytes, as well as, reinforcement of the chemiotoxic action in oncological patients treated with other drugs. Clinically, it ranges from a non-specificity of symptoms to lesions such as osteomyelitis with necrosis and osseous sequesters that may be accompanied by fetor ex oris, with the appearance of many Actinomyces contaminated lesions. As for published antecedents on osteonecrosis due to bisphosphonate treatment found until 2006 : 46. 5 % had a previous diagnosis of multiple myeloma; 38. 8 % were patients with metastatic breast cancer; 6. 2 % patients of metastatic prostate cancer; 4. 1 % suffered from osteoporosis; 3. 5 % from other metastatic diseases and 0. 8 % had Paget disease. The drugs that seem to have the highest incidence of osteochemionecrosis are: zoledronate, pamidronate, alendronate, risendronate and ibandronate, from the greatest to the least.

40|$|Classically, the {{endocrine}} vitamin D {{system is}} essential for maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Sufficient vitamin D levels promote bone health and prevent <b>osteopathies,</b> such as rickets and osteomalacia. However, the discovery of an intracrine vitamin D pathway alluded to other roles for vitamin D in regulating the immune system. Specifically, research on the innate immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection demonstrated a vitamin D-mediated antimicrobial response. Here, we continued to investigate the role of vitamin D in the immunobiology of mycobacterial infection. In Chapter 1, we studied mycobacterial infection using leprosy as a disease model. We demonstrated that induction of the type I IFN gene program during Mycobacterium leprae infection is an active immune evasion mechanism used to subvert the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response through {{the suppression of the}} vitamin D activating enzyme, CYP 27 B 1. Moreover, our studies comparing macrophages associated with each of the two poles of the leprosy disease spectrum—lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) and tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep) —provided additional insight into susceptibility versus resistance to infection. T-lep-associated macrophages with elevated CYP 27 B 1 expression and activity at baseline were resistant to type I IFN-mediated suppression and capable of inducing an antimicrobial response, whereas L-lep-associated macrophages were not. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of control of the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response in the host-pathogen interaction. In Chapter 2, we focused on markers of host defense to identify factors which confer protection against mycobacterial infection. These studies revealed that IL- 32 is associated with IL- 15 - and IFN-γ-induced host defense networks. IL- 32 is also necessary and sufficient to induce CYP 27 B 1 activity and the downstream antimicrobial response. These studies pinpoint IL- 32 as an important regulator of vitamin D-dependent host defense. Finally, in Chapter 3, we studied the effects of 1, 25 D on the iron regulatory protein, hepcidin, which regulates iron homeostasis by binding ferroportin and preventing the export of iron. Our results showed that 1, 25 D suppresses hepcidin expression in monocytes. These findings are important in the context of mycobacteria which are intracellular pathogens that rely on scavenging iron from the host to survive. Therefore, regulation of hepcidin may be another key battleground in the host-pathogen interaction...|$|R

It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s in California, the American Medical Association (AMA) {{spent nearly}} $8million {{to end the}} {{practice}} of osteopathic medicine in the state. In 1962, Proposition 22, a statewide ballot initiative in California, eliminated the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state. The California Medical Association (CMA) issued M.D. degrees to all DOs {{in the state of}} California for a nominal fee. [...] "By attending a short seminar and paying $65, a doctor of <b>osteopathy</b> (D.O.) could obtain an M.D. degree; 86 percent of the DOs in the state (out of a total of about 2000) chose to do so." [...] Immediately following, the AMA re-accredited the University of California at Irvine College of Osteopathic Medicine as the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, an M.D. medical school. It also placed a ban on issuing physician licenses to DOs moving to California from other states. However, the decision proved to be controversial. In 1974, after protests and lobbying by influential and prominent DOs, the California Supreme Court ruled in Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association, that licensing of DOs in that state must be resumed. Four years later, in 1978, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific opened in Pomona, and in 1997 Touro University California opened in Vallejo. [...] As of 2012, there were 6,368 D.O.s practicing in California.|$|E
