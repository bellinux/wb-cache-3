[...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

RFID, wireless sensor and actuator networks, embedded devices) on a larger scale. Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems, several projects suggest to make them {{an integral part of}} the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon and the scalability and evolvability of the Web can be leveraged. In this paper we look at “physical mashups”, were tech-savvy create lightweight, ad-hoc applications <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> smart <b>things</b> just as they currently create Web 2. 0 mashups. We present the early version of a mashup framework that provides services for composing things and illustrate this by means of two mashup editors. ...|$|R

We have developed a distributed architecture that allows to create and control mash-up applications in an easy and scalable way, without specific knowledge on both hardware and programming languages. In addition, we have also defined a centralized public database deployed on the Internet, to manage and share physical resource information.

The term pay is interpreted in a broad sense to include, <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> wages, <b>things</b> like holidays, pension rights, company perks and some kinds of bonuses.
