5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu {{wrote the}} {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), {{which made him}} well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the}} most performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war, Frederick {{had one of}} {{the finest}} armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E

During the finale <b>outset's</b> <b>of</b> the investigation, the detail {{finally got a}} photo of Spiros when he was meeting drug lieutenant Eton on the waterfront of Baltimore. The detail then surveilled his home and followed him to meetings at hotel rooms and the diner where he met with associates.|$|R

5|$|By the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed {{down to a}} more {{manageable}} eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from New Castle, Pennsylvania, and Mansfield, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. The high cost was anticipated, as organizers were aware at the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> their bid that most facilities {{would have to be}} constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination at the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers {{in the western part of}} the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E
5000|$|The family Flacourtiaceae was, as Hermann Sleumer said, a fiction, [...] and Peridiscus was, {{from the}} <b>outset,</b> one <b>of</b> its most {{doubtful}} members. Recognizing its distinctiveness, João Kuhlmann segregated it {{into its own}} family in 1947.|$|R
40|$|Walecki tournaments were dened by Alspach in 1966. They {{speak in}} favor of Kelly's {{conjecture}} from 1964. Namely, they are regular tournaments which admit Hamilton directed cycle decomposition. The enumeration of Walecki tournaments was presented as an open problem in a paper by Alspach in 1989. These two problems led us to study the arc structure of Walecki tournaments. They possess {{a broad range of}} subtournaments isomorphic to some Walecki tournament. A specic permutation is proven to be an automorphism of a Walecki tournament with a given pattern. Subtournaments induced by the <b>outsets</b> <b>of</b> vertex t(0) are proven to be either regular or almost regular. ...|$|R

5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Provisions loaded at the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> {{the voyage}} {{included}} 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already {{had a reputation for}} eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cotton {{mills in}} the United States were horse-powered. The first mill {{to use this}} method was the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, built in Beverly, Massachusetts. It was started on 18 August 1788 by entrepreneur John Cabot and brothers. It was operated in joint by Moses Brown, Israel Thorndike, Joshua Fisher, Henry Higginson, and Deborah Higginson Cabot. The Salem Mercury reported that in April 1788 the equipment for the mill was complete, consisting of a spinning jenny, a carding machine, warping machine, and other tools. That same year the mill's location was finalized and built in the rural <b>outsets</b> <b>of</b> North Beverly. The location had the presence of natural water, but it was cited the water was used for upkeep of the horses and cleaning of equipment, and not for mass-production.|$|R
5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the <b>outset</b> more <b>of</b> a political affair than a theological dispute. The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes {{to come to the}} fore.|$|R
5000|$|The Middle East Institute {{was founded}} in 1946 to promote {{the study of the}} region in a modern, policy-relevant context. From its <b>outset,</b> one <b>of</b> its {{priorities}} was [...] "the editing and publishing of an authoritative journal on Middle Eastern affairs." [...] Accordingly, the first issue of the journal appeared in January 1947.|$|R
5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{chief and}} the national vice chief are selected by a caucus of the section chiefs at the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Order of the Arrow's national planning meeting.

5|$|After her World War I service ended, Siboney was {{returned}} to the Ward Line and placed in New York–Cuba–Spain transatlantic service; the liner ran aground at Vigo, Spain in September 1920. Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe at the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of psychologically distressed primary care patients present exclusively somatic concerns at the <b>outsets</b> <b>of</b> their visits. However, {{it is not known}} how often such patients subsequently disclose psychosocial problems to their primary care physicians (PCPs) and what variables predict such disclosures. Our objectives were to measure, among psychologically distressed primary care patients, the frequency of disclosure of psychosocial problems (disclosure), the effects of prior psychosocial inquiry (prior inquiry) by PCPs and various patient variables on disclosure, and the effect of disclosure on mental health problem recognition (recognition) by PCPs. The study was based in the practices of 69 community-based PCPs and involved 308 adult patients with 28 -item General Health Questionnaire scores of 5 or greater, indicating significant psychological distress. Disclosure occurred during 51 % of visits overall and 67 % of visits with prior inquiry. The odds of disclosure were increased by prior inquiry (pPrimary care Mental health Psychosocial problems Physician-patient communication Disclosure Recognition...|$|R
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major wagon train. While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century {{most of the}} European {{settlements}} {{were related}} to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E

6000|$|When Kipps {{made his}} {{call on the}} Walshinghams, it all {{happened}} so differently from the [...] "Manners and Rules" [...] prescription ("Paying Calls") that he was quite lost from the very <b>outset.</b> Instead <b>of</b> the footman or maidservant proper in these cases, Miss Walshingham {{opened the door to}} him herself.

50|$|As I {{said at the}} <b>outset,</b> none <b>of</b> {{this should}} come as a {{surprise}} to any of us. Terrorism has been a tool used by Saddam for decades. Saddam was a supporter of terrorism long before these terrorist networks had a name. And this support continues. The nexus of poisons and terror is new. The nexus of Iraq and terror is old. The combination is lethal.|$|R
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 2006 season, Sanchez {{competed for}} the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered {{the starting quarterback}} when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame {{but he did not}} attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Korean War, Leyte {{was ordered}} to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds {{despite the efforts of}} wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
50|$|The Loyal Parliament was {{the only}} Parliament of England of King James II, in theory {{continuing}} from May 1685 to July 1687, but in practice sitting during 1685 only. It gained its name because at the <b>outset</b> most <b>of</b> its members were loyal to the new king. The Whigs, who had previously resisted James's inheriting the throne, were outnumbered both in the Commons and in the Lords.|$|R
50|$|The {{transhipment}} {{of goods}} from the Wismar-Rostock standard gauge {{line to the}} narrow gauge railway proved to be costly and unprofitable. The carriage of standard gauge wagons on narrow gauge transporter wagons as was common, for example, on the Saxon narrow gauge railways, was ruled out from the <b>outset</b> because <b>of</b> the narrow urban section through Bad Doberan. Thus, on 31 May 1969, goods services were withdrawn.|$|R
