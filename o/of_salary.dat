5|$|The WCHL's {{short and}} {{unstable}} existence {{was a result}} <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> escalation caused by having three leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to requesting international aid, the Yemen government declared Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates as disaster areas, after then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh surveyed the affected areas. The president also utilized the nation's military to assist storm victims, and sent aircraft with tents, food, and medicine {{to the worst}} hit areas. To {{raise money for the}} disaster recovery, the Yemeni government cut one day <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> for all workers, equating to $4.25million, and the government provided another $100million from its annual budget. Local charities and residents collectively raised $8.5million. Yemen's Red Cross provided meals and water to about 21,000people. The agency also provided school kits for 4,500students whose facilities were damaged. Ultimately, the Red Cross assisted over 70,000storm victims through health programs, and also helped residents cope with stress, hygiene promotion, and other ongoing vulnerabilities to their livelihoods.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former {{negotiator}} for the National Labor Relations Board, attempted {{to organize the}} Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining. Murphy decried the reserve clause in player contracts that gave team owners unlimited control over the player's services, and demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract and the right <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> arbitration. Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players. Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included Honus Wagner, who was 72 {{years old at the}} time.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama.

Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to {{the conclusion of the}} term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.|$|E

25|$|The {{pension benefit}} is not {{insignificant}} {{because it is}} estimated to cost 25% <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> over the entire 25-year period to fund a pension benefit of half the salary at age 55 for someone who starts employment at age 30. While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. The key point to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse mortality table, the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut. Citing the rising cost of health care, the MTA wanted new employees to contribute 1% of their salary to pay for health insurance. Transit workers currently do not pay for health insurance.|$|E
