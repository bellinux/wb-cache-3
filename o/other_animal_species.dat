5|$|The archaeological and {{historical}} records suggest interdependence {{between humans and}} vultures for millions of years. Like <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> early hominins probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, {{in the form of}} carcasses, in the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs also {{practice}} alloparental care, {{in which}} a female may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common, and is seen in many <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> such as the elephant.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, fish and other resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E

25|$|The gopher {{tortoise}} (Gopherus polyphemus) is {{a species}} of the Gopherus genus native to the southeastern United States. The gopher tortoise {{is seen as a}} keystone species because it digs burrows that provide shelter for at least 360 <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> They are threatened by predation and habitat destruction.|$|E
25|$|Communication through bird calls can {{be between}} {{individuals}} {{of the same}} species or even across species. Birds communicate alarm through vocalizations and movements that are specific to the threat, and bird alarms can be understood by <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> including other birds, in order to identify and protect against the specific threat.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to determine the}} physiological mechanisms underlying the synchronization of the ERG amplitude rhythm. Chronic ERG recordings were obtained from juvenile instars of crayfish. Changes on the ERG amplitude rhythm produced when 30 min blue light illuminated the telson were determined. The PRC obtained with these data showed advances in the early subjective night and delays in the late subjective night. These phase shiftings resemble the features of curves obtained by dark pulses in other species. The relation of this curve with PRCs generated in the crayfish and <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> <b>species</b> are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The island's only {{permanent}} macro-organism inhabitants {{are common}} periwinkles and other marine molluscs. Small numbers of seabirds, mainly fulmars, northern gannets, black-legged kittiwakes, and common guillemots, use the rock for resting in summer, and gannets and guillemots occasionally breed successfully if the summer is calm with no storm waves washing over the rock. In total {{there have been}} just over twenty species of seabird and six <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> observed (including the aforementioned molluscs) {{on or near the}} islet.|$|E
5|$|Herons and egrets are {{medium to}} large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. They all fly with their necks retracted.

50|$|There {{are eight}} species of rotavirus, {{referred}} to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Humans are primarily infected by species A, B and C, most commonly by species A. A-E species cause disease in <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> <b>species</b> E and H in pigs, and D, F and G in birds.Within rotavirus A there are different strains, called serotypes. As with influenza virus, a dual classification system is used based on two proteins {{on the surface of}} the virus. The glycoprotein VP7 defines the G serotypes and the protease-sensitive protein VP4 defines P serotypes. Because the two genes that determine G-types and P-types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses, different combinations are found.|$|R

25|$|This {{species has}} been {{documented}} to compete for food resources with several <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> B. lecheguana competes with the ant species Camponotus blandus for the plant Banisteriopsis maliflora, and, consequently, the wasp is typically found on ant-free plants and {{has been known to}} interrupt its foraging when an ant approaches. This supports the hypothesis that B. lecheguana is in a mutualistic relationship with the plant B. maliflora, since the plant supplies nectar reserves to the wasp, and the wasp preys on herbivorous insect larvae living on the plant.|$|E
25|$|Flu spreads {{around the}} world in {{seasonal}} epidemics. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new strain of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> When it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of H5N1 posed a great risk for a new influenza pandemic; however, this virus did not mutate to spread easily between people.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol (E2), also spelled oestradiol, is a steroid, an estrogen, and {{the primary}} female sex hormone. It is named for and is {{important}} in the regulation of the estrous and menstrual female reproductive cycles. Estradiol is essential for the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues such as the breasts, uterus, and vagina during puberty, adulthood, and pregnancy, but it also has important effects in many other tissues, including bone, fat, skin, liver, and the brain. While estrogen levels in men are lower compared to those in women, estrogens have essential functions in men, as well. It is found in most vertebrates and crustaceans, insects, fish, and <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

30|$|Many <b>other</b> {{terrestrial}} <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> especially invertebrates, {{have been}} introduced across Europe unintentionally, mostly as stowaways or contaminants on traded products, on vehicles (e.g. ships), or as diseases/parasites of plants, animals, and humans [9, 31 – 33]. In general, much less is known about introductions of species that were introduced unintentionally because they are usually not recorded until they become established.|$|R
25|$|The large, {{distinctive}} and powerful cats are popular zoo exhibits. The Siberian tiger is bred {{under the auspices}} of the Species Survival Plan (SSP), in a project based on 83 tigers captured in the wild. According to most experts, this population is large enough to stay stable and genetically healthy. Today, approximately 160 Siberian tigers participate in the SSP, which makes it the most extensively bred tiger subspecies within the program. Developed in 1982, the Species Survival Plan for the Siberian tiger is the longest running program for a tiger subspecies. It has been very fortunate and productive, and the breeding program for the Siberian tiger has actually been used as a good example when new programs have been designed to save <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> from extinction.|$|E
25|$|Nervous {{systems are}} found in most {{multicellular}} animals, but vary greatly in complexity. The only multicellular animals that have no nervous system at all are sponges, placozoans, and mesozoans, which have very simple body plans. The nervous systems of the radially symmetric organisms ctenophores (comb jellies) and cnidarians (which include anemones, hydras, corals and jellyfish) consist of a diffuse nerve net. All <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> {{with the exception of}} a few types of worm, have a nervous system containing a brain, a central cord (or two cords running in parallel), and nerves radiating from the brain and central cord. The size of the nervous system ranges from a few hundred cells in the simplest worms, to around 300 billion cells in African elephants.|$|E
25|$|Clutch size is {{typically}} three eggs, {{although it is}} two {{in some of the}} smaller species and only one egg for the swallow-tailed gull. Within colonies, birds synchronise their laying, with synchronisation being higher in larger colonies, although after a certain point, this levels off. The eggs of gulls are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and scrawl markings, and are well camouflaged. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with incubation bouts lasting between one and four hours during the day and one parent incubating through the night. Research on various bird species including the gull suggests that females form pair bonds with other females to obtain alloparental care for their dependent offspring, a behavior seen in <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> like the elephants, wolves, and the fathead minnow.|$|E
