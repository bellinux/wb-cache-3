5000|$|Tetraoxygen {{had been}} {{suspected}} to exist {{since the early}} 1900s, when it was known as <b>oxozone.</b> It was identified in 2001 by a team, led by F. Cacace, at the University of Rome. The molecule [...] {{was thought to be}} in one of the phases of solid oxygen later identified as [...] Cacace's team suggested that [...] probably consists of two dumbbell-like [...] molecules loosely held together by induced dipole dispersion forces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tetraoxygen}} molecule (O4), {{also called}} <b>oxozone,</b> was first predicted in 1924 by Gilbert N. Lewis, who proposed {{it as an}} explanation for the failure of liquid oxygen to obey Curie's law. Today it seems Lewis was off, but not by much: computer simulations indicate that although there are no stable O4 molecules in liquid oxygen, O2 molecules do tend to associate in pairs with antiparallel spins, forming transient O4 units. In 1999, researchers thought that solid oxygen existed in its ε-phase (at pressures above 10 GPa) as O4. However, in 2006, it was shown by X-ray crystallography that this stable phase known as ε oxygen or red oxygen is in fact [...] [...] Nevertheless, tetraoxygen has been detected as a short-lived chemical species in mass spectrometry experiments.|$|E
