5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E

5|$|The present {{purpose is}} to {{illustrate}} the role of representation theory <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> in mathematics and in physics.

5|$|A variety <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> {{ranging from}} {{government}} institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's {{life and work}} since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.|$|E
5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> of Jews venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely speaks {{of a small group}} of Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E

5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.

5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{voluntary}} running training were investigated in the 13 -week-old female Fischer 344 -rats (N= 12). Animals {{were divided into}} two groups : sedentary (S; N= 6) or voluntary running training (VT; N= 6) group at 5 -week of age. Animals in group VT were given free access to the running wheel for 8 weeks. Body weight <b>of</b> two <b>groups</b> was significantly increased during training period. The average running revolution <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT was 10483 ± 1041 (mean±SD) per day (Min.; 1 506 ± 287, Max.; 17601 ± 1539). Heart weight and relative heart weight <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT were significantly higher than group S. The plantaris (PLA) weight and the relative PLA weight <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT were significantly higher than group S. No change of protein concentration was observed in two groups. In protein content, the value <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>group</b> S. In the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform composition of the PLA muscle, no change of type I MyHC isoform was observed with training, while, type II d MyHC isoform <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>group</b> S. Moreover, type II a MyHC isoform <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT was significantly higher than that <b>of</b> <b>group</b> S. Relatively, type II b MyHC isoform <b>of</b> <b>group</b> VT was significantly lower than that <b>of</b> <b>group</b> S. These results indicate that voluntary running training causes the great changes of myosin heavy chain composition and hypertrophy in the rat plantaris muscle...|$|R
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E
5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream success <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> {{like the}} Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University student {{organizations}} {{include a}} diverse array <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> focused on social justice issues, including organizations run through both Student Affairs and the Center for Social Justice.

Georgetown Solidarity Committee is a workers' rights organization whose successes include ending use of sweatshops in producing Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering pay raises for both university cleaning staff and police. Georgetown Students for Fair Trade successfully advocated for all coffee in campus cafeterias to be Fair Trade Certified.|$|E
