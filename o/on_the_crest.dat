5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|The old name of Royston crow {{originates}} {{from the}} days when this bird was a common winter visitor to southern England, the sheep fields around Royston, Hertfordshire, providing carcasses on which the birds could feed.

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 8 August, {{supported}} by the 7th Battalion of the Gloucesters and by extensive artillery and naval fire, the Wellington Battalion succeeded in capturing Chunuk Bair with relatively little resistance. Malone set about securing the crest of Chunuk Bair, but it proved difficult to deepen the relatively shallow Turkish trenches that had been captured by his men, and the work was made even more difficult as the sun rose, allowing the Turks on neighbouring Hill Q to focus their gunfire on the positions occupied by the Wellingtons. The Gloucesters, also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> were forced to retreat to the reverse slope. The Turkish gunfire caused heavy casualties amongst the infantry holding Chunuk Bair, but crucially also prevented substantive reinforcements from reaching the crest in daylight. Instead, those soldiers that made it up Chunuk Bair tended to be positioned on its rearward slopes and thus had difficulty observing any approaches made by the Turks. Malone continued to co-ordinate the defences but a portion of the crest was lost. He remained in constant action, and led bayonet charges to counter numerous Turkish attacks. The trenches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> became filled with the bodies of dead, further reducing what little cover was available.|$|E

5|$|With Battle Mountain {{in their}} possession, the North Koreans {{set out to}} gain control of P'il-bong to the southeast. In the predawn hours of September 14 a force of 400 to 500 North Korean men {{attacked}} I and L Companies, 24th Infantry, on P'ilbong. Several attacks were repulsed, but because of men leaving their positions L Company's strength dwindled from 100 to 40 men. The remnant of L Company withdrew toward I Company's position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of P'il-bong, only to find that this company under a relatively minor attack had left the hill. They could not hold P'il-bong with the handful of men remaining and it was also lost.|$|E
5|$|Down {{from the}} slopes {{in front of}} Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at Leibstandartes positions. As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried {{the men of the}} 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls. The troops of Leibstandarte were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the {{previous}} week's fighting, many were just starting their day {{at the outset of the}} attack. As the Soviet armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. Obersturmbannführer Rudolf von Ribbentrop, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of the hill, Sturmbannführer Joachim Peiper's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within the cemetery. A larger rectangular structure with an east-west alignment, identified from postholes left in the ground, stood on the east side. It has been interpreted as a chapel or shrine. A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a mortuary chapel was located close by in the central area of the cemetery. An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer standing at the time the cemetery was laid out. All of these buildings would have stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of a ridge, and would have been especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of Sibidang-san, an antipersonnel {{minefield}} {{stopped the}} first North Korean infantry assault. More attacks followed in quick succession, {{all of which}} were repulsed by the US troops' superior firepower. By 02:30 the B Company riflemen were so depleted of ammunition that they began stripping machine-gun bullets from the ammunition belts and using them in their rifles. The 1st Platoon of C Company, {{at the base of the}} mountain behind B Company, climbed Sibidang-san in 45 minutes with an ammunition resupply for the company. Just before dawn the North Korean attack subsided. Daylight revealed a vast amount of abandoned North Korean equipment scattered on the slope just below the crest, including 33 machine-guns. Among the North Korean dead was the commanding officer of the NK 13th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{forces were}} entrenched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of two small hills, between which {{the road from}} Arroyo to Guayama ran. The Americans had crossed a stream {{in front of the}} hills when {{suddenly}} the Spanish opened fire. The Americans protected their position by the stream and increased their firepower as more reinforcements arrived. The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as the Americans made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama. General John Rutter Brooke used the Cautiño Residence (Casa Cautiño) by the town square in Guayama as his military headquarters.|$|E

5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Government {{required}} that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, {{and it was}} no easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{confusion}} about which characteristics that were sexually dimorphic in the species. Only three specimens were sexed (all males), {{with age and}} individual variation not considered. The male {{is thought to have}} been largest with a longer, curvier beak. In 1911, Réunion resident Eugène Jacob de Cordemoy recalled his observations of the bird about 50years before, suggesting that only males had a white crest, but this is thought to be incorrect. A presumed female (MNHN 2000-756) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest, a smaller and less-curved beak, and smaller primary coverts. A juvenile specimen has a smaller crest and primary coverts, with a brown wash instead of ash grey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest,</b> lore, and superciliary stripe, and a light-brown (instead of ash-brown) back. The juveniles of some southeast Asian starlings are also browner than adults.|$|E

5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
5|$|The German host {{was waiting}} for the Romans, {{probably}} drawn up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> of the hill, to give Chnodomar's men the advantage of the slope. The German left wing was held by Chnodomar and his cavalry. Demonstrating that he was well aware of the threat posed by the Roman heavy cavalry, Chnodomar had devised a stratagem. He interspersed lightly armed infantry among his cavalry. These were easy to conceal in the standing grain. The idea was that in a mêlée, the foot soldiers would bring down the cataphracts by crawling along the ground and stabbing their horses in their underbellies, which were unprotected. The dismounted riders, weighed down by their armour, could then easily be despatched on the ground. The German right wing blocked the highway to Strasbourg, while in the woods beyond the highway were a substantial force of warriors hidden in ambush on Chnodomar's orders. The right wing was under his nephew Serapio (who was given his Greek name by his Hellenophile father). Although still a teenager, Serapio had already proved a military leader worthy of his uncle. The rest of the line was probably divided into pagi units under five major kings and ten petty kings.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crest</b> or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E
