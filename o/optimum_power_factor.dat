40|$|The {{conventional}} {{power factor correction}} techniques assume the voltage source to be purely sinusoidal. But this is rarely true because the nonsinusoidal currents drawn by nonlinear loads incur nonsinusoidal voltage drops across source impedance and transmission line impedance. The result is a nonsinusoidal voltage supply applied to the load. Under such conditions, any attempt to make the power factor unity by usual methods {{will result in a}} nonsinusoidal current, which increases total harmonic distortion (THD). On the other hand attempt for harmonic free current may not result in unity power factor because of harmonics present in the voltage. Thus, there is a trade off between improvement in power factor and reduction of THD. With the law enforcing agencies getting more vigilant about power quality, it has become unavoidable to optimise power factor while satisfying harmonics limits. In this paper, a novel technique for optimisation of harmonics and power factor subject to power quality constraints is presented for nonsinusoidal voltage conditions. The technique is based on Lagrange multiplier method and calculates the concerned control coefficients by Newton Raphson method. This is used to compute the desired source current for <b>optimum</b> <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> satisfying the power demand of the load while meeting the THD limits. Knowing the load current, the compensating current that must be supplied by the active filter to the power system can be calculated. The proposed scheme does not use the widely used p-q theory and is applicable for both the single-phase and three-phase systems. Analysis using MATLAB has shown encouraging results. The scheme is being implemented in hardware using DSP. © IEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Power {{control is}} of great {{importance}} in reducing cochannel interference and increasing the capacity of mobile telecommunications systems. The aim of <b>optimum</b> <b>power</b> control procedure is to achieve a maximum Carrier-to-Interference Ratios (CIR) in all active communication links (i. e. CIR balancing). <b>Optimum</b> <b>power</b> control with CIR balancing has been widely studied for Frequency-Division/Time-division Multiple Access (FDMA/TDMA) cellular systems. In these systems, the CIR-balanced <b>optimum</b> <b>power</b> control was transformed to an eigen-value problem using link-gain matrix. The same method was proposed to CDMA systems. However, {{the size of the}} link-gain matrix is proportional to the square of the number of communication links in the system. Thus, the computation of the eigenvalue may be infeasible in CDMA systems with high load. Moreover, <b>optimum</b> <b>power</b> control has never been studied in crossed slots where some mobiles are active in downlink and other in uplink. A simplified <b>optimum</b> <b>power</b> control scheme has been proposed to reduce the link-gain matrix only in the forward link. In this paper, we introduce a simplified generic <b>optimum</b> <b>power</b> control scheme for uplink, downlink and crossed slots. This scheme is based on a link-gain matrix whose size is proportional to the square of the number of cells.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for MScWhen the complex power definition is analyzed, it will be seen that, if a pure resistive load is connected to an AC source, the source will be fully utilized while the reactive power delivered will be zero. A practical load, however, absorbs both active power and reactive power. The active power does the useful work, while the reactive power is required to produce the electromagnetic field. Both the active and the reactive powers place a burden on the conductor (or on distribution line), however the power company must provide the current to the load whether it is inductive or capacitive, and this current generates the power losses in the distribution lines and also increases the maximum demand. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze LV distribution feeders of substations to find the optimum point along the feeder to correct the <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> At this particular point, the loss, which considered as the main burden are at minimum level while some reduction in maximum demand. To find the optimum point, calculation for each and every point load (i. e. pole load) is very difficult and complex task without having a specially developed computer software package. Hence the whole loads of the distribution feeder are generalized to thirteen point loads (i. e. twelve spans). Calculations have been done based on practically obtained data to determine the <b>optimum</b> location for <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction. This shows that, pay back period is very attractive and results were quite differing from case to case due to different loading patterns of the feeders. Still this type of <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction is not being practiced by both the utilities (CEB & LECO) of Sri Lanka. This study shows that there is a high potential to improve the LV system performance by having a relatively low investment with farley short pay back periods. I...|$|R
