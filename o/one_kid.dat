500|$|The {{video was}} {{recorded}} at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 7, 2001. War at the Warfield was Slayer's second DVD. Originally set for release on February 11, 2003, and later February 13, 2003, it was delayed several times, due to unspecified [...] "production issues". However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, you got your kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear the place up. And then you get the <b>one</b> <b>kid</b> that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether he does it or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, then they go to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Volk {{helped lead}} the Colts to another Super Bowl appearance, but were now {{representing}} the AFC following the merger of the two leagues (NFL and AFL) that year. [...] This time, the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V. [...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and <b>one</b> <b>kid,</b> at the time. I remember we were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, and we got the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win. Because this was like a dream come true on the sand beaches in the Bahamas." ...|$|E
500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set I would think to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent <b>one</b> <b>kid</b> to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E
