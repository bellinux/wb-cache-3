This paper presents the effect of tunnel cover to diameter ratio and relative density of sand on surface settlement induced by tunneling using physical modelling. The aluminum casing with outer diameter of 50 mm was used to model the tunnel shield. The size of the casing was 2 mm diameter larger than the tunnel lining. The tunnel excavation was done by pulling out the tunnel shield at constant speed with a mechanical pulley. The tested variables are cover to diameter ratio (1, 2 and 3) and relative density of sand (30 %, 50 % and 75 %). The results demonstrated that the surface settlement decreased as the relative density increased. Also, as the relative density of sand increased, the <b>overload</b> <b>factor</b> at collapse increased. The surface settlement was at the highest when the cover to diameter ratio was 2.

Results show that, {{with an increase in}} elevation, the abutment forces and bending moment of the arch dam increase first and then decrease from the bottom {{to the top of the}} dam. Abutment forces and bending moment reach their maximum at the middle or middle-down portion of the dam. The distributions of abutment forces and moment do not change during overload. The magnitude of each arch layer’s forces and moment increases linearly during overload. This result indicates that each arch layer transmits bearing loads to the rocks of the left and right banks steadily. This research explains the operating mechanism of an arch dam under normal and overload conditions.

The same problem can be also extended to active user detection case. Despite the development of lower and upper bounds for the sum channel capacity in Section III, it is desirable to find the actual sum capacity for any given number of users, chip rates, and signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, it is very desirable to find the actual capacity regions. In active user detection systems, channel capacity should be explored with and without side information about the active users. The capacity bounds and the capacity region should be also extended to the near-far effects as discussed in Section IV. In the near-far effects, channel capacity should be derived considering channel state information. Finally, the asynchronous case should be explored for all the above cases. Generalized user vectors [60] is another interesting topic to be studied.|$|R

The two construction parameters that were varied were the face pressure and the grout pressure. Longitudinal settlement profiles were obtained for many different face pressures and several different grout pressures. Results show that the ground surrounding the tunnel is very sensitive to changes in grout pressure in terms of surface settlement and failure of the soil body, while a wide range of face pressures can be accommodated without failure. Furthermore, minimum surface settlement is achieved for a certain face pressure and becomes larger as the pressure is increased or decreased from that particular value, which for this analysis corresponded to an <b>overload</b> <b>factor</b> of one. Also, results show that surface settlement decreases with increasing grout pressure, as expected. by Jedediah Drury Greenwood. Thesis (M. Eng.)

With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension of codewords.

40|$|The Afsluitdijk {{is unable}} to {{withstand}} the future conditions that belong to an annual probability of occurrence of 1 / 10 000 per year for water level and wave conditions. Solution of Rijkswaterstaat is to strengthen the dike according {{to the principle of}} the wave overtopping resilient dike (NL: Overslagbestendige dijk). Therefore the Afsluitdijk {{has to be able to}} cope with large amounts of wave overtopping (> 150 l/s/m). The current design methods are unsuitable to prove the resistance of the Afsluitdijk against these large amounts. The goal of this thesis is to develop design procedures in order to prove the landward slopes erosion resilience of the Afsluitdijk against large amounts of wave overtopping. Based on a theoretical study a new design procedure has been developed, this method consists of six sub-procedures, two choices and two results. The first step is to determine the wave overtopping discharge. Up to 30 l/s/m good quality grass can be applied. This average wave overtopping discharge appeared a good measure for the load below 30 l/s/m. Otherwise the load should be expressed as the front flow velocity per overtopping wave. It is important to express the velocity for each wave separately, because only waves resulting in a higher velocity than the critical velocity contribute to the damage. Damage only occurs if the critical velocity the landward slope is able to withstand is exceeded. These wave are the number of critical overtopping waves Ncow or the percentage of waves that contribute to the damage Pcow. The overtopping velocities are based on empirical relations between the overtopping velocity and volume. The volume has been determined using the probability of a certain wave volume to occur (a Weibull distribution with a freeboard dependent scale factor a and shape factor b). A categorization based on the discontinuities and objects that are present on the Afsluitdijk has been created. For each category an amplification factor for the front flow velocity has been derived which varied from 1 (no influence) to 2. 1 (for holes). With the velocity distributions the required critical velocity can be calculated using the cumulative <b>overload</b> <b>factor.</b> In which each wave has contributes to the damage D. The influence of the storm duration and the allowable damage number D on the critical velocity has been analyzed. As well as the relation between the critical velocity, the number of critical overtopping waves and the percentage of critical overtopping waves. The results of the procedure are a required protective top layer or required investigations to complete the procedure. These investigations can be the development of the flow velocity on the berm, gradual transition between slope and berm, transition between dike section geometry, transition between different revetment types, influence of bushes, damage as an effect of large external structures and the resilience of revetments other than grass. The application of this procedure to the Afsluitdijk resulted in required critical velocities varying from 5. 8 (smooth crest) to 12. 4 m/s (rectangular structures). From tests in the past it appeared that the top layer of the Afsluitdijk is able to withstand 6. 3 m/s. This is insufficient for the conditions considered in the thesis. The limits of grass are exceeded and another revetment type should be applied. For pulsating wave overtopping currently no method exists that is able to prove the resilience of other revetments than grass, this is due to the non steady state character of wave overtopping. With this knowledge and realizing that the whole outer revetment should be replaced as well, it can be questioned if the concept of an overtopping resilient dike is the best choice for the reinforcement of the Afsluitdijk.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} develop a mechanism for designing competence-oriented tasks in various academic subjects and requirements for its implementation in higher educational establishments.   Methods. The authors conducted a theoretical analysis of philosophical, psychological and pedagogical literature sources on the research issues to implement the objectives of the study; Russian and foreign educational experience on the use of study tasks in the study process is studied and summarized; educational and syllabus documentation and training materials are analyzed (syllabi, textbooks, manuals, task and exercise books, etc.); normative documents are studied (State Educational Standards, Federal State Educational Standards, Main Syllabi, curricula, instructional acts, etc.). Empirical research methods involve observation, testing, questioning, modeling, peer review, pedagogical experiment and statistical interpretation of the study results. The study was carried out from 2007 to 2012 in the Engineering-Pedagogical Faculty of Moscow State Agroengineering Goryachkin University. 240 students were engaged in the pedagogical experiment. The following Moscow colleges provided facilities for the peer review of the list and solution frequency of vocational education tasks by secondary vocational school teachers: Colleges of Civil Engineering No 1 and No 12, Small Business College No 48, Polytechnic College No 13, Printing and Publishing College No 56, and Electromechanical College No 55.   Results. The research findings demonstrate that the competence-oriented tasks are shown as an integrative didactic unit of professional competence development. Its functions, classification, and structural components are given. The mechanism of designing competence-oriented tasks in various academic subjects is developed and tested. The proposed mechanism is an invariant for academic and teaching staff of educational establishments at all levels of professional education, including both higher and secondary specialized educational establishments. Currently, the mechanism is implemented in academic and teaching staff’s methodical and teaching activities in RSAU-MAA named after K. A. Timiryazev, and the system of training and criterion competence-oriented tasks is included in educational and methodical packages for different subjects and applied in the University study process.   Scientific novelty. The authors have systemized and extended general theoretical didactical views on the need for competence-oriented tasks as the educational ones (as a component of the teaching content and technology) and the criterion ones (as a method and means of monitoring the process and the result of developing students’ professional competence in the process of studying of different subjects); have specified the structure of the competence-oriented tasks (the structure elements: a condition, a requirement, and a construct) and determined the functions of the competence-oriented tasks in the modern university study process (gnostic, subject-and-activity, educational, axiological, creative, managing, motivation and incentive, control and assessment). The grounds for the classification of the competence-oriented tasks are considered: its position in the hierarchy of the formed competencies, professional activities stated in the State Educational Standard, types of the formed skills, the content of tasks and its intended purposes, the mode of learning and cognitive activity of students, the study forms implying the use of the tasks, and the number of students involved in the problem solving. The criteria for constructing a system of competence-oriented tasks (completeness, reliability and validity) and indicators (the system completeness coefficient, the didactic capacity coefficient, the <b>overload</b> <b>factor</b> of students, the degree of mastering the activities) are identified. The model of competenceoriented tasks, including regulatory, informative, technological, diagnostic, organizational and administrative units in their integrity and unity ensuring the effectiveness of the development of students’ professional competencies is worked out. The authors show the mechanism of designing a system of competence-oriented tasks in a subject matter, including the following stages: analytical and constructive, verification and implementation, control and correction.   Practical significance. Much attention is given to the implementation of the model of a system of competence-oriented tasks in the study process in the Engineering-Pedagogical Faculty of Goryachkin University (MSAU) contributed {{to improve the quality of}} training students in General and Professional Pedagogy, the development of their subject, subject-cycle (the psychological-pedagogical cycle), as well as a certain set of general cultural and professional competencies. The proposed mechanism of designing competence-oriented tasks is invariant and can be used to elaborate a system of competence-oriented tasks in other academic subjects taught in higher educational establishments.   The obtained research results contribute to the implementation of the competence-based approach in the study process of modern higher educational establishments and can be used in further training of university academic and teaching staff.    </p...|$|E

40|$|This pioneer study {{deals with}} {{difficulties}} {{faced by the}} beginning Arab teacher. The theoretical framework of the research is based on Veenman’s (1984) analysis, which indicates 24 difficulties faced by the begin ning teacher. These difficulties have been classified into eight categories ranked in order of importance. The study seeks to identify the difficulties experienced by the beginning Arab teacher during his first year of teaching and to predict his future dissatisfaction with teaching based on those difficulties. The ques tionnaire drafted especially {{for this study was}} completed by 130 participants (beginning teachers). The responses were analyzed, yielding six factors of difficulty. The findings indicate difficulties involving : 1) the interpersonal communication between beginning Arab teachers {{on the one hand and}} both students and parents on the other, 2) overload, 3) didactic and disciplinary knowledge, 4) support and recognition, 5) organizational climate (school culture), and 6) satisfaction. We examined the correlation between the be ginning Arab teacher’s difficulties and his dissatisfaction with his work. The research findings reveal that the organizational climate (school culture) and <b>overload</b> <b>factors</b> significantly affect the satisfaction vari able. With regard to the relation between the beginning Arab teacher’s general background characteristics and his difficulties in the first year, the background variable, specialization, was found to affect the factors of difficulty. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the genotype-phenotype correlation of the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a genetic disorder of iron metabolism, in Matera province (Basilicata, Italy). Integrating both epidemiological and molecular approaches, we studied: (a) {{the frequency of the}} HH main mutations; (b) the association between mutations and HH cases. The majority of patients with HH are homozygous for the C 282 Y mutation of the HFE gene. A second mutation (H 63 D) is more widely distributed and its connection with HH isn’t clear, but a low penetrance is attributed to this variant. The population-based study consists of three steps: (1) determination of iron biochemical parameters, (2) genetic test, (3) sequencing of HFE gene and bioinformatics studies. A case report is presented in a 41 -year-old male (genotype: H 63 D/wt) with biochemical and clinical evidences of HH, in absence of secondary iron <b>overload</b> <b>factors.</b> In the cohort of studied patients (150 M: 62 F), there are 18 homozygous patients; H 63 D/H 63 D genotype is found in 11 cases. In the heterozygous group, H 63 D/wt is the predominant genotype (61 / 68 subjects). All the H 63 D/wt residents in the same village (Mont.) show altered biochemical parameter levels. In our case study, a substitution localized into the HFE promoter (nt 225 A>C) is found. Results show that the H 63 D genotype is responsible for most cases of HH. The peculiar clinical manifestation found in Mont. suggests a founder effect. In our case, the iron overload is related to a presence of an undetected mutation, critical for the transcriptional regulation of the HFE gene...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Growth {{of white}} adipose tissue {{takes place in}} normal {{development}} and in obesity. A pool of adipose progenitors {{is responsible for the}} formation of new adipocytes and for the potential of this tissue to expand in response to chronic energy <b>overload.</b> However, <b>factors</b> controlling self-renewal of human adipose progenitors are largely unknown. We investigated the expression profile and the role of activin A in this process. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Expression of INHBA/ activin A was investigated in three types of human adipose progenitors. We then analyzed at the molecular level the function of activin A during human adipogenesis. We finally investigated the status of activin A in adipose tissues of lean and obese subjects and analyzed macrophage-induced regulation of its expression...|$|R
