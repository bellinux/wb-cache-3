5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|Word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> spread, {{eventually}} reaching Patton's superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{who ordered}} him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States. While the U.S. Congress {{and the general public}} expressed both support and disdain for Patton's actions, Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.|$|E

5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans {{have been killed by}} extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships as a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E
5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given and none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being {{a source of}} food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck {{and some of the}} rest of the party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E

5|$|During the 2012 season, {{all of the}} WindSeekers except Kings Island's {{experienced}} {{incidents in}} which the ride stopped, stranding riders in the air. Two such incidents occurred in September at Knott's Berry Farm, in one case leaving riders stranded {{at the top of}} the ride for nearly four hours, prompting the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to order the ride shut down indefinitely on September 19 pending investigation of both the length of time riders were stranded and the actual causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents.</b> Two days later on September 21, Cedar Fair announced the closure of all other WindSeekers to conduct an internal review. The company said that until the review concludes, none of the rides would operate again. The rides remained closed through the remainder of the 2012 season at the five seasonal parks but reopened at all parks in 2013, excluding Knott's Berry Farm's version which has been relocated.|$|E
5|$|Including the two disqualifications, ten drivers {{failed to}} finish the race, six of them because of {{accidents}} including Kubica. Four of them gearbox failures. Several cars were damaged during the race: Wurz's rear wing was damaged in the incident that took out Speed, while Davidson hit a groundhog on the racetrack. This meant that the safety car had to be deployed on four occasions. At the final restart on lap sixty, all of the remaining twelve cars {{were on the same}} lap creating some close racing and a lot of overtaking. Hamilton sustained his consistent pace throughout all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> and pulled clear of Heidfeld in the closing stages, taking his first race win relatively comfortably. Barrichello dropped ten places on his final pit stop. Hamilton's championship lead was strengthened when Sato overtook the reigning world champion to move into sixth place around the outside of the final chicane, having switched to the harder tyres on his final stop.|$|E
5|$|At the start, several drivers {{made contact}} with one another into turn two. Sebastian Vettel {{was hit in the}} rear by Daniil Kvyat there and during turn three, the latter of which caused him to crash into the barrier and retire from the competition. Further back, Nico Hülkenberg was hit by Esteban Gutiérrez and {{collected}} Rio Haryanto, forcing both Hülkenberg and Haryanto into retirement as well. As the safety car came out to allow for the cars and debris to be cleared from the track, several cars headed to the pit lane to repair damage, among them Daniel Ricciardo, Daniil Kvyat and Sergio Pérez. The order at the restart on lap four was: Rosberg, Räikkönen, Bottas, Massa and Hamilton, who had stayed clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidents</b> to move up to fifth. On the restart, Bottas moved ahead of Räikkönen, while Hamilton made a successful move on Massa into fourth. Kvyat's early pit stop left him in 15th at that point, and he soon served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for his contacts with Vettel, dropping him to last. Meanwhile, Hamilton overtook Räikkönen to move into third on lap seven. Felipe Nasr came into the pit lane on lap 12 to replace a slow puncture on his tyres. The order at the front remained the same until Bottas became the first front runner to pit for fresh tyres on lap 17. Hamilton followed suit one lap later, but still emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him into turn two another lap later. On lap 20, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming back out behind Hamilton, but ahead of Bottas. All the while, Rosberg led comfortably ahead of Max Verstappen, who made his first stop on lap 23 and dropped back.|$|E

50|$|The {{prima facie}} cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> was {{excessive}} speed; {{the train was}} travelling at 112 km/h when it derailed at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> a curve with a speed limit of 60 km/h.

50|$|The Raman {{scattered}} light is emitted by <b>the</b> stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electric field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> light.

In reality, however, some fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Raman scattered light has a polarization direction that is perpendicular to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> light. This component is called the perpendicular component. Naturally, <b>the</b> component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Raman scattered light whose polarization direction is parallel to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> light is called the parallel component, and the Raman scattered light consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parallel component and the perpendicular component.

40|$|Vortex {{interaction}} {{with a thick}} elliptical leading-edge at zero relative offset produces a pronounced secondary vortes of opposite sense that travels with the same phase speed as the primaty vortex along <b>the</b> lower surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edge.

When the thickness is sufficiently small, there is a definite severing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> vortex and <b>the</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> vortex that travels along <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical surface has a considerably larger phase speed than that along the lower surface; {{this suggests that the}} integrated loading along the upper surface is more strongly correlated. When the thickness becomes too large, then most, if not all, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> vortex passes below the leading-edge.
