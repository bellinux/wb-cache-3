5|$|José de San Martín was {{the fifth}} and last son of Juan de San Martín, an {{unsuccessful}} Spanish soldier, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser. He was born in Yapeyú, Corrientes, an Indian reduction of Guaraní people. The exact year of his birth is disputed, as there are no records of his baptism. Later documents formulated during his life, such as passports, military career records and wedding documentation, gave him varying ages. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents</b> point to his year of birth as either 1777 or 1778. The family moved to Buenos Aires in 1781, when San Martín was {{three or four years}} old.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament of the United Kingdom {{presented}} a loyal address to Queen Elizabeth II in 1965 {{to mark the}} 700th anniversary of Montfort's Parliament, and the Queen addressed both Houses of Parliament. The House of Lords Record Office, {{now known as the}} Parliamentary Archives, organised an exhibition in the Houses of Parliament of several important Acts of Parliament. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents</b> were displayed again in a 2015 exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{documents}} {{most often}} cited to justifying {{the elimination of}} Native mascots are the advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Neither <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents</b> refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and {{context of the use}} of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Linden, {{author of}} The Parrot's Lament {{suggests}} {{there are many}} examples of animal behavior and intelligence that surpass what people would suppose to be the boundary of animal consciousness. Linden contends that in many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documented</b> examples, a variety of animal species exhibits behavior {{that can only be}} attributed to emotion, and to a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species.|$|R
5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents</b> appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents</b> was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E
5|$|In 1349, John plundered a Venetian {{commercial}} ship {{which had}} been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled, {{in accordance with the}} medieval principle of jus naufragii. This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order to settle the dispute between Venice and John, as evidenced by an official document from 13 April 1350. Despite this conflict, under John the Principality of Valona was an active partner of Venice and Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) in maritime commerce. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John's role as a mediator in cattle, sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs. The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships. Even though all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents</b> were written in Slavic, John signed his name in Greek, which testifies to his Hellenisation. At the time, John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who addressed him as “King of Serbia and Bulgaria” in correspondence.|$|E
50|$|The couple {{began to}} {{document}} every basket she produced from 1895-1925. This {{expanded to include}} about 120 baskets that are documented. Most if not all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documented</b> baskets where sold at Cohn's Emporium, while the Cohns provided Keyser with food, lodging, and healthcare. The supreme craftsmanship <b>of</b> <b>these</b> baskets certainly added to the value, but the Cohns' early documentation promoted her artwork. Scholars have discovered that almost everything the Cohns wrote about Keyser was an exaggeration or fabrication.|$|R

5|$|The Republic of Lebanon's Identity Card is {{the main}} form of {{identification}} on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Lebanon. All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not. According to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer. While police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>documents,</b> the law does not state that one is obliged to submit the document at that very moment.|$|E

50|$|All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>document</b> {{management}} systems are principally concerned with organizing objective information sources {{rather than the}} expression of subjective knowledge. Yet their methods are useful to consider with respect to PKB systems, because such {{a large part of}} our knowledge comprises things we remember, assimilate, and repurpose from objective sources. Search environments like SketchTrieve, as well as snippet gatherers like YellowPen, address an important need in knowledge management: bridging the divide between the subjective and objective realms, so that the former can make reference to and bring structure to the latter.|$|R
