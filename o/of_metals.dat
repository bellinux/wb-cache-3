5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them.

5|$|In 1529, Georgius Agricola {{described}} fluorite as an additive used {{to lower}} the melting point <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> during smelting. He penned the Latin word fluorés (fluor, flow) for fluorite rocks. The name later evolved into fluorspar (still commonly used) and then fluorite. The composition of fluorite was later determined to be calcium difluoride.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue damage}} test <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber {{vibration}} isolator is performed, {{the result of}} which shows that fatigue damage performance <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber is different from conventional solid materials. The damage <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber which is accumulated with its inner partial broken and wore wires, results in deterioration of its macro-mechanical characteristic, macro-cracking and final fatigue failure, so it does not rupture as sudden failure of solid material. It is difficult to describe damage evolution <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber in the microscopic perspective, and from a macro point of view, it is feasible method to describe degree of fatigue damage which bases on the changes of mechanical properties. In order to reflect the incremental cumulative damage degree <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber, the stiffness damage and damping damage are used to accurately describe the fatigue damage process <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> robber, and the comprehensive damage factor D is proposed to be the fatigue failure criterion. Damage factor D can predict fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber specimen accurately, so it has reference significance to design <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> rubber...|$|R

5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical {{model for a}} classical electron moving through a metallic solid.

However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and magnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>metals,</b> and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities <b>of</b> <b>metals.</b> About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts <b>of</b> <b>metals.</b> About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E

5|$|When {{used as a}} flux {{for welding}} or soldering, {{metallic}} lithium promotes the fusing <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities.

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories <b>of</b> <b>metals,</b> metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E

The environmental relevance <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> processing is often low {{when compared to the}} environmental impacts of the preceding mining and refining of ores as well as their processing into metal ingots, so that the negligibility <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> processing has become a commonly used axiom of many LCA studies. Even for the production of lightweight components in the aviation industry, this credo is commonly recited while referring to the good recyclability <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> This paper analyses whether this credo of the negligibility <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> processing in LCA can really hold true for the production of lightweight components and crystallizes its major environmental hotspots...|$|R

5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms.

The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E

5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people.
