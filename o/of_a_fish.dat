5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species.

5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where the outline <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> pond can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{is part of}} a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes a scene from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin in the mouth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> in order to pay the temple tax. It owes its importance in particular to its revolutionary use of perspective and chiaroscuro. The Tribute Money suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough restoration in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that the speed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and the tail <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish.</b> Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or {{falling in love with}} humans.|$|E
5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E

5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish,</b> and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} shortfin mako shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first like that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish,</b> then in turn {{like that of a}} reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E

5|$|The body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E
