However the plans were put on hold after an Australian national, Santhanam, successfully appealed for a court injunction to stop the films release in September 2013. He claimed that Gemini Film Circuit had agreed to pay him a sum of six million rupees for his services of providing production facilities during the teams schedule in Australia, but had failed to make the payment. Under financial restraints, Gemini Film Circuits had also sold on the film to Vishals newly launched production studio, Vishal Film Factory, but failed to inform Vishal of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>payment</b> which had to be made to Santhanam. The High Court subsequently had put a stay order on the release of the film until the issue was sorted. Vishal then took up the responsibility in trying to release the film, and helped get it censored, but was unsuccessful in getting the film released. Vishal later disassociated from the film and Gemini Film Circuit acquired the film again from the actor, and revealed that they would release the film in due course.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Ensuring and {{maintaining}} positive cash flow {{is becoming more}} and more difficult, especially in the construction industry. Payments need to be collected to be able to sustain a positive cash flow and this is not an easy process. Organizations fail due to insufficient available liquid assets and this study is done to determine why payments aren’t made, including information on what payment provisions contractors agree upon, and why the trend in the industry is to keep cash rather than pay suppliers. The collection of <b>outstanding</b> <b>payments</b> is also investigated, including actions taken if payments are not made, what clauses are included in contracts to ensure payment and if interest is charged on <b>outstanding</b> <b>payments.</b> A credit application processes need to be in place to ensure the credit worthiness of the clients/ employers is reviewed. It is also very important that some form of contract is agreed upon, understood and signed by both parties. There are instances where the contract documentation is not provided or the contract documents is provided and signed, but one of the parties has not read or understood some of the payment clauses. This could also lead to delayed <b>payments.</b> Collection of <b>outstanding</b> <b>payments</b> could be to propose a payment agreement, by charging interest or alternatively, enforcing early payments by providing a settlement discount. One of the most mentioned reasons for companies holding onto cash is to ensure liquid capital is available to ensure positive cash flow and the continuation of the business. The main reasons why liquid capital is not available is poor management of funds, poor payment procedures and mismanagement of funds. It was found that most of the construction companies have credit application processes, contracts and payment provisions in place, but most of these companies don’t adhere strictly to the procedures set out in these documents. More attention need to be given to enforcing credit and collection policies in practice, as well as following the payment provisions set out in the construction documentation. Questionnaires were only sent to companies operating in the construction industry. Further investigations can be done on other industries (including construction, mechanical, electrical, medical, farming, food sector, fashion sector etc.), which can assist in assisting with payments made by companies or individuals...|$|R
