40|$|Background/Objectives:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the validity and reliability of the Main Meal Quality Index when applied on the UK population. Subjects/Methods:The indicator was developed to assess meal quality in different populations, and is composed of 10 components: fruit, <b>vegetables</b> (<b>excluding</b> potatoes), ratio of animal protein to total protein, fiber, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, processed meat, sugary beverages and desserts, and energy density, resulting in a score range of 0 – 100 points. The performance of the indicator was measured using strategies for assessing content validity, construct validity, discriminant validity and reliability, including principal component analysis, linear regression models and Cronbach’s alpha. Results:The indicator presented good reliability. Conclusions:The Main Meal Quality Index has been shown to be valid for use as an instrument to evaluate, monitor and compare the quality of meals consumed by adults in the United Kingdom.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of pre-treatments and storage on the physical, chemical and sensory attributes of wild lettuce (Lactuca taraxacifolia). The pre-treatments included blanching with 0. 125 % (w/v) Na 2 CO 3 at 95 oC for 1 min and without Na 2 CO 3 with subsequent drying. All vegetable samples were analyzed for colour (Hunter L, a, b), vitamin C, β-carotene, minerals (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe), rehydration ratio (fresh <b>vegetable</b> <b>excluded)</b> and moisture content before and after storage at intervals of two weeks {{for a period of}} three months. The vitamin C, β-carotene, rehydration ratio and mineral contents of all the vegetables (pre-treated and untreated) decreased with increasing storage period. Sensory evaluation showed vegetable soup prepared from unblanched-sundried wild lettuce showed comparable quality to the soup prepared from fresh leaves. Wild lettuce leaves could be preserved by sun drying with prior blanching in 0. 125 % (w/v) Na 2 CO 3 for minimal loss of quality...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{harmonize}} food classification {{and food}} composition databases, allowing comparability of consumption at both food and nutrient levels in Europe. Design: To establish {{the level of}} comparability at the food level, the EFCOSUM group benefited from the work already carried out within other European projects, which established a Euro Food Groups (EFG) classification system. Four food groups, ie bread, <b>vegetables</b> (<b>excluding</b> potatoes), fruits (excluding fruit juice) and fish and seafood, were judged on their applicability for making food consumption data comparable across countries at the food level. Conclusions: It was concluded that the EFG system could be used but that still much work has to be done. For food consumption data to be collected in the future, the software {{that will be used}} should enable conversion of foods 'as consumed' to foods at the 'raw edible' level. With respect to comparability of nutrient intake estimations, EFCOSUM advises waiting for the European Nutrient Composition Database (ENDB) currently being prepared by the EPIC group. Until this is available, comparison of consumption data at the nutrient level cannot be carried out between countries.
