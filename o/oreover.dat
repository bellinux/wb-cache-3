As a result, the varied and subtle {{ways in which}} disengagement may be manifested at school have been overlooked. This thesis seeks to draw on insights from the interactionist tradition to explain how forms of disengagement are displayed within various situations and the diverse factors that may engender it. These issues are explored in the distinctive context of the Caribbean. The research was undertaken at a secondary school in St. Lucia and ethnographic methods were used to understand students' actions, along with their interpretations, explanations and evaluations {{of themselves and their}} circumstances. Hence, the research relied on a range of data sources including lesson observations, informal interviews, and questionnaires. Personal and official documents were also analysed. tv 1 <b>oreover,</b> the perspectives of teachers and parents were used to enhance and corroborate students' experiences. The research revealed that students engaged in different forms of both quiet and disruptive disengagement, either on an individual basis or as collective acts. In order to explain these, I examined the demands made on them by teachers, home concerns, as well as peer-related and other institutional factors. A major finding of this research is that while many students expressed a positive orientation to school, they engaged in diverse behaviours which amounted to forms of quiet disengagement.

R ecent evidence {{has shown that}} somemiRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the potential association of miRNA expression with clinical outcome in patients with gastric cancer. Experimental Design: Expression of 250 human mature miRNAs was measured by real-time PCR on paraffin-embedded tumor samples of 21 patients with gastric cancer stage III uniformly treated with surgical resection followed by chemoradiation. We identified the miRNAs correlated with disease-free and overall survival times, and the results were evaluated including 24 other patients. In vitro cell proliferation and radiosensitivity studies were done to support clinical data. Results:The results revealed that down-regulation ofmiR- 451 was associatedwithworse prognosis. m iR- 451 was detected by in situ hybridization in epithelial cells and showed decreased expression in gastric and colorectal cancer versus nontumoral tissues. O verexpression of miR- 451 in gastric and colorectal cancer cells reduced cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to radiotherapy. Microarray and bioinformatic analysis identified the novel oncogene macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a potential target of miR- 451.

To this aim, we developed and studied a mouse model to allow labeling of esophageal cells with the histone 2 B-GFP (H 2 B-GFP) fusion protein. Results: First, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing the reverse tetracycline transactivator rtTA 2 -M 2 under control of the promoter (ED-L 2) of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene encoding the latent membrane protein- 1 (LMP- 1). The newly generated ED-L 2 -rtTA 2 -M 2 (ED-L 2 -rtTA) mice were then bred with the previously developed tetO-HIST 1 H 2 BJ/GFP (tetO-H 2 B-GFP) model to assess inducibility and tissue-specificity. Expression of the H 2 B-GFP fusion protein was observed upon doxycycline induction but was restricted to the terminally differentiated cells above the basal cell layer. To achieve expression in the basal compartment of the esophagus, we ubsequently employed a different transgenic model expressing the reverse transactivator rtTA 2 S-M 2 {{under the control of}} the ubiquitous, methylation-free CpG island of the human hnRNPA 2 B 1 -CBX 3 gene (hnRNP-rtTA). Upon doxycycline administration to the compound hnRNP-rtTA/tetO-H 2 B-GFP mice, near-complete labeling of all esophageal cells was achieved. Pulse-chase experiments confirmed that complete turnover of the esophageal epithelium in the adult mouse is achieved within 710 days.

The analytical focus is on the discourses that frame the development of the SFI program with a specific interest in categorizations and identity in relation to gender, language and national belonging. The empirical material includes historical texts (curricula, commission reports, public inquiries, political propositions, laws) from 1965 to 2010, as well as approximately 95 hours of audio and video recorded data and ethnographic field notes from five SFI classrooms. The results are presented primarily in the four articles but partly also in the thesis itself. Our analysis in the first study, that takes a sociohistorical perspective as a point of departure, indicates shifts in discourses with regards to the categories and aims of the educational program, thus, making certain identity positions more accessible than others at specific times. Using the approach of nexus analysis, the theoretical framework employed in the second study approaches language policies n terms of a dialectical elationship between policy and the learning that takes lace in the language focused classroom. Feminist and postcolonial frameworks re employed ore pecifically in the third and fourth studies. The historical nalysis presented in article three shows how the categories of “immigrant” and Swedes” ave been produced and negotiated in discourses on gender and gender quality in the SFI program since the early 1970 s.

The eventually produced mechanic ally weak zones may not however be directly seen from the surface. A new method, the s o-called pressure probe (Pre-P) method was developed for such problems to detect and chara cterise such areas. In this paper the features and application of this method is presente d on {{the example of a}} landslide. Repeatability of the Pre-P measurements, adequate s ampling distance, resolution of the method and the possible data processing steps are a lso investigated. The fracture system of the investigated landslide area could have been inv estigated by large resolution applying the Pre-P method. We know from these investigations tha t: 1. there are consolidated zones on the slope side of the fractures whose broadness correla tes with the broadness of the given fracture; 2. both the large and the small fractures follow each other periodically; 3. even the structure inside the blocks which belong to the lar ge fractures can be well seen which refers to the very good resolution of the method. It was m <b>oreover</b> shown that on the not-yet sliding side: 1. there are already fractures, that is the f uture slide-faces already exist; 2. those fractures are at least as wide as the fractures on the sliding side; 3. the blocks in this side are about two times wider than those of the sliding sid e. It is possible to pre-indicate, as well, that: 1. a several meter wide block will slump down before the main slide will happen; 2. the likelihood of sliding is much greater in the North part of the area than in the South part of it.

The benefits to market participants are easier access t o a wider range of financial products, increase in liquidity and lower transaction costs. Indeed, since its incorporation, Euronext has the second largest capitalization in E urope. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the conseq uences of Euronext integration on the French, Belgian and Dutch stock markets. It rai ses two questions: 1. has the merger improved the information efficiency of the m arkets; and 2. has the level of integration between the markets increased following the incorporation of Euronext? The study uses daily prices for the markets’ main i ndices for the period 01 / 01 / 1990 to 10 / 12 / 2010. The original sample is divided into thr ee periods: pre-integration, integration and post-integration period. Two types of returns are computed: log- returns and excess returns. A dummy variable and a control variable, the German main index DAX, are included in the analysis to acc ount for the effect of the introduction of the Euro. Unit root and stationarity tests show that prices s eries are integrated of the first order and that the returns series are stationary. Moreove r, the volatility of returns exhibits long-memory patterns. The data generating process o f all the returns series is captured with ARMA-GARCH models. The returns exhibit volatil ity clusters in all sub- periods. Hence, the information efficiency of the m arket has not increased following Euronext integration. However, GARCH models do not include an asymmetric component for the post-integration period, indicati ng that the returns do not display leverage effects after the creation of Euronext. Fi nally, a Euro dummy variable was significant only for the Belgian returns. Cointegration tests show that the three indices exp erience long-run equilibrium during the integration and the post-integration periods.

The decrease o f ball speed during the sim ulated m atches tended to be greater with high-than with low-stiffness string (P-. 06). H ence, playing tennis with high-stiffness string prom otes forearm m uscle fatigue developm ent, w hich could partly contribute to the groundstroke ball speed decrem ent during the game. Keywords: sport engineering, electrom yography, gripping force, im pact, racquet C om posite m aterials have allowed racquet engineers to design tennis racquet fram es by considering the physics o f the sw ing, w ithout being lim ited by the structural lim itations o f wood. C on­ sequently, m odern racquets are generally stiffer, lighter, and have a low er sw ing w eight (ie, m om ent o f inertia) than old wood racquets. 1 These structural modifications have therefore prom oted a change in playing style from one based on the correct execution o f the tech­ nique to one characterized by power and spin. 2 Indeed, although sw ing speed does not significantly vary as a function o f racquet m ass, it is significantly increased when sw ing w eight decreases. 1 Thus, modern racquets allow the players to swing the racquet faster. 3 This contributes to the faster pace o f m odern tennis, together with the im proved fitness o f tennis players, and larger racquet heads that allow players {{to hit the ball}} faster, w hile still m aintaining a good ball co n tro l. 1 M <b>oreover,</b> despite being lighter, com posite fram es are stiffer than traditional frames.

For a sam e m om entum variation (ie, mass x speed variation o f the ball-racquet system), if the friction betw een the ball and the stringbed during the collision is neglected, the im pulse o f the ball in the stringbed (ie, im pact force x contact time) does not change, w hatever the string properties. However, it is generally accepted that a string with a low stiffness bends m ore than one w ith high stiffness during the collision, thereby increasing the contact tim e and thus lim iting the im pact forces transm itted from the racquet to the player. 5 The impact forces destabilize the racquet, w hich m ainly tend to recoil, thereby generating a high torque at the wrist joint. This phenom enon is also influenced by the location o f ball im pacts: 3 the racquet rotation within the hand is increased for off-center im pacts (below or above the longitudinal axis o f the racquet, for exam ple). 6 Therefore, a high gripping force is required to prevent excessive rotation o f the racquet at im pact. 6 - 9 However, it is widely accepted that the repetition ot high force gripping contractions generates m uscle fatigue, w hich reduces maximal gripping force. 10 The use o f high-stiffness string, w hich translates into increased im pact forces, could thus result in the increase o f the required gripping strength, thereby prom oting fatigue developm ent. T he tension o f the string may also affect the intensity o f im pacts. Low ering tension would have the sam e effect that low-stiffness string; that is, the slightly longer contact time would translate into a higher outgoing ball speed, as long as the deform ation o f the string is perpendicular to the string plane, and a low er im pact force. However, when the strings begin to m ove w ithin the string plane, rubbing against each other, som e elastic energy is lost. 3 M <b>oreover,</b> playing with a low string tension also translates into reduced control o f the ball. 3 Thus it does not seem recom m endable to play with a low string tension. In that context, players may be prone to choose high-stiffness string, w hich allow s a better control o f the ball trajectory.

It has been argued that the aggregate earnings profiles may be twisted over time when the age composition of the labor force changes, and workers of different ages are imperfectly substitutable in production. During the 1970 s and early 1980 s, the structure of male earnings changed noticeably and the changes coincided with the arrival of the peak-sized cohorts spawned by the post-Korean War baby boom. Thus, the changes in age composition of labor force are supposed to be a major factor in the explanations given for the earnings changes. Theories and approaches which hinge on the supply of labor have been advanced and empirically examined by Freeman (1979) and Welch (1979), and modified and broadened by scholars such as Giant and Hammerers (1981) and Berger (1983 b, 1984, 1985) in the case of the U. S. Even though previous research has established that baby-boom cohorts have suffered depressed earnings relative to older cohorts, there is a disagreement regarding the steepness of the earnings profile of these large cohorts. In specifying human capital earnings equations for the analysis in the case of Korea, this study modified the specification employed in the previous studies. First, the earnings equations are here estimated by firm size and educational level in order to consider the firm size differences in demand for labor. Second, the period effects on real earnings are eliminated to avoid a specification error and completely capture the parallel shifts of cross-sectional earnings profiles over time. In this pooled time-series analysis by using the data from Occupational Wage Surveys of Korea covering the period from 1972 to 1982 by two years intervals, it is found that while cohort size depresses earnings at entry, these negative effects of cohort size diminish and wages reach "normal" levels at relatively young ages, except for college graduates in small and medium-size firms. That is, cohort size generally has a negative effect on earnings levels, but a positive effect on early career earnings growth in Korea's labor market. r 4 <b>oreover,</b> the greatest positive effect on earnings growth is found in small firms for all education levels, which is consistent with the idea that the substitutability between younger and older workers is greatest in small firms, and the smallest in large firms. The regression results for the college graduates in small and medium firms indicate a positive effect of cohort size on earnings even in the early career phase. One interpretation of this finding is that there would be relatively strong complementarity between work activities performed at different phases of the career in professional and managerial capacities where the highly educated tend to be concentrated. The other possible interpretation is that there could be a specification error in the earnings equations estimated, which do not completely control for changes in the quality of schooling in different cohorts. In summary, cohort size effects on earnings levels generally appear to decline with experience. The effects of large swings in demographic composition of the labor force on the structure of earnings may be temporary in nature...|$|E

Nessa perspectiva, ao pesquisar sobre o saber/fazer clínico psicológico, revelaram-se múltiplas atitudes, ações, intervenções, orientações, interpretações, possíveis e cabíveis, ao psicológico na relação/cuidado com o sujeito. Lançando como profissional e/ou pesquisador no vasto campo da clínica psicológica, é importante compreender o que facilita ou dificulta uma ação situada. Parte-se de uma compreensão de ação implicada como constituinte no modo de ser humano: sujeito que age. Assim, este trabalho visa, a partir de uma experiência específica, trazer um outro olhar, ressignificando o fazer clínico psicológico no contexto do hospital, à luz da fenomenologia existencial e de dispositivos para a ação clínica psicológica. Recorreu- se à metodologia qualitativa, inspirada na figura do narrador e amparada no método fenomenológico para interpretação. A matéria-prima desta obra {{consiste}} em narrativas da experiência do psicólogo/pesquisador e dos interlocutores nos atendimentos, criança e sua mãe, no Centro de Tratamento de Queimados, além de relatos de profissionais dessa mesma equipe de saúde. Ao final, procurou-se uma articulação entre o conhecimento vivido/afetivo e o conhecimento teórico, a partir do diálogo com autores. Vislumbrou-se que a ação psicológica no C. T. Q. situa-se no campo teórico-prático do Aconselhamento Psicológico, como prática clínico- psicológica e educacional, numa dimensão interdisciplinar de ação social clínica. Foram, ainda, evidenciadas peculiaridades da comunicação entre a psicóloga, a criança e sua mãe, compreendidas como utensílios/utilitários facilitadores da intervenção psicológica. Espera-se, com este trabalho, apontar aberturas para ousadias responsáveis na atuação clínica, com implicações para o estudo e prática interdisciplinarConsidering {{the pain}} and suffering of the burned child who is in hospital, this author was concerned mostly with the kinds of current clinical help which are offered by the psychology professionals staff. From this view point when one researched about the saber fazer, that is, the psychological and clinical know-how, there were a great number of possibilities as to the fazer saber, e. g. how to reach the suffering child in his/her innerself and let him/her know that there is someone who in fact can help. It was found out that {{there were a number of}} attitudes, actions, interventation and interpretation which the psychologist could make use of in his relationship and care for the subject, the burned child. Therefore, the psychologist and/or researcher should be conscious about how broad the psychological clinical field is, and further he/she needs to understand clearly what may help as well as what may prevent a certain contextual action. One should start from understanding the subjects individual experience as a unique human being. This study aims to take a rather different look at the burned child specific experience, and tries to provide a new meaning to the psychological clinical action, inside a hospital, enlightened by both the existential phenomenon and attitudes for the psychological clinical action. The qualitative methodology was chosen, and it was inspired by the narrator himself. It was also supported by the phenomenal method for interpretation. The material analysed is made up of narratives based on the psychologist/researcher experiences, as well as from the burned child and the mother, who were in the Burned Treatment Center (BTC). In addition, reports from professionals belonging to the same health staff were considered. Finally, special attention was given to both the experienced/affectionate knowledge and the theoretical one, all deriving from talks to area field experts. It was discovered that the psychological action done at the BTC is in the pratical-theoretical field from the Psychological Advice, and it is deemed as an educational and psychological-clinical practice, in an interdisciplinary dimension of a clinical social action.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are to {{simulate}} the dynamics of F 1 -ATPase and related molecular motors and to investigate their conformational changes and coordinating mechanisms. The structure and functionality of F 1 -ATPase and other molecular motors were explored {{with the aid of}} structural analysis and molecular simulation, respectively. Molecular dynamics was employed to study the dynamics of F 1 -ATPase and other molecular motors. Steered molecular dynamics was used to explore the unbinding pathways of ATP from F 1 -ATPase. Structural properties of molecular motors retrieved from the Protein Data Bank were studied in tandem with the simulation results. The structural fluctuations of ADP/Mg:ADP and ATP/Mg:ATP were studied in three different molecular systems. Periodic boundary conditions and spherical boundary conditions were used for comparison reasons. Structural parameters such as inter atomic distances, bonds, angles and dihedral angles were obtained by data mining of crystal structures of molecular motors and from simulation results. The coordination dynamics of Mg 2 + in molecular motors was investigated. Alignments of ADP, Mg:ADP, ATP and Mg:ATP were done to explore their flexibility and conformational diversity in molecular motors. The role of water molecules in determining the conformational fluctuations of ADP and ATP was investigated. The functional role played by Mg 2 + was correlated with its coordination diversity. The pathways of ATP nucleotide upon unbinding were analysed and the conformational changes triggered in ab subunits by this unbinding process are presented. These changes were studied using structural alignments and Ramachandran plots. The dynamics of hydrogen bonds during unbinding was determined by measuring the interatomic distances between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom bonded to oxygen or nitrogen. The simulation results show agreement with the experimental results obtained by X-ray diffraction or NMR. The alignment analysis showed that the tight pocket of molecular motors diminishes the flexibility of ADP/ATP while the presence of water allows for higher flexibilities. The extensibility of the ADP and ATP molecule was shown using radius of gyration to be higher in the loose pockets and smaller in tight pockets of molecular motors. The diversity of conformations adopted by the phosphate region of ATP in crystal has been reported previously for a small number of ATP molecules. The main cause of this conformational diversity is the presence of Mg 2 +. As it was shown, the presence of Mg 2 + is likely to facilitate the structural changes of the ribose base ring. This in turn drives the phosphate group to adapt different conformational states corresponding to ribose structural arrangements. These structural changes in ribose also cause the adenine to adopt different conformational states. The investigations of RMSD, RMSF and radius of gyration of ADP and ATP in the systems investigated were used to assess their structural extensibility and stability. These results together with the interaction energy investigation between water molecules or protein and ATP suggest that ATP is structurally much more unstable when coordinated by Mg 2 + and the number of water molecules in pocket is high. ATP has a more stable behavior in the proteins where the number of water molecules is significantly lower. ATP appears to have the highest degree of structural instability in solvent followed by loose pocket and is most stable in tight pocket. Simulation results and data mining investigations provided a detailed picture of conformational fluctuations of ADP/ATP and Mg 2 + coordinating dynamics in molecular motors. The agreement between simulation and experimental data allowed exploring new mechanisms as those that take place during unbinding of ATP from F 1 -ATPase. SMD investigations show that Mg 2 + remains in the pocket after ATP is unbound. The hydrogen bonds were shown to form and break during the unbinding process. They are closely related with the force required to unbind ATP from F 1 -ATPase. Investigations of water density in the hydratation shells and pRDF show that in the tight pocket the number of water molecules is small. In loose or open pocket water molecules are in a bigger number determining ADP/ATP to adopt more folded structures. The folding of ATP was shown also to be enhanced by a three coordination mechanism of Mg 2 + with the phosphate group of ATP. This work elucidates the diversity of conformational fluctuations of ADP/Mg:ADP and ATP/Mg:ATP nucleotides and the coordinating dynamics of Mg 2 + in molecular motors. <b>oreover,</b> it explores the structural and coordinating changes that take place in F 1 -ATPase during ATP unbinding...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been a great {{interest}} in the millimeter-wave (mmW) and terahertz (THz) bands due to the unique features they provide for various applications. For example, the mmW is not significantly affected by the atmospheric constraints and it can penetrate through clothing and other dielectric materials. Therefore, it is suitable for a vast range of imaging applications such as vision, safety, health, environmental studies, security and non-destructive testing. Millimeter-wave imaging systems have been conventionally used for high end applications implementing sophisticated and expensive technologies. Recent advancements in the silicon integrated and low loss material passive technologies have created a great opportunity to study the feasibility of low cost mmW imaging systems. However, there are several challenges to be addressed first. Examples are modeling of active and passive devices and their low performance, highly attenuated channel and poor signal to noise ratio in the mmW. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop new technologies enabling cost-effective implementation of mmW and sub-mmW imaging systems. To achieve this goal, an integrated active Rotman lens architecture is proposed as an ultimate solution to combine the unique properties of a Rotman lens with the superiority of CMOS technology for fabrication of cost effective integrated mmW systems. However, due to the limited sensitivity of on-chip detectors in the mmW, a large number of high gain, wide-band and miniaturized mmW Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) are required to implement the proposed integrated Rotman lens architecture. A unique solution presented in this thesis is the novel Band Pass Distributed Amplifier (BPDA) topology. In this new topology, by short circuiting the line terminations in a Conventional Distributed Amplifier (CDA), standing waves are created in its artificial transmission lines. Conventionally, standing waves are strongly avoided by carefully matching these lines to 50 Ω in order to prevent instability of the amplifier. This causes that {{a large portion of the}} signal be absorbed in these resistive terminations. In this thesis, it is shown that due to presence of highly lossy parasitics of CMOS transistor at the mmW the amplifier stability is inherently achieved. Moreover, by eliminating these lossy and noise terminations in the CDA, the amplifier gain is boosted and its noise figure is reduced. In addition, a considerable decrease in the number of elements enables low power realization of many amplifiers in a small chip area. Using the lumped element model of the transistor, the transfer function of a single stage BPDAs is derived and compared to its conventional counter part. A methodology to design a single stage BPDA to achieve all the design goals is presented. Using the presented design guidelines, amplifiers for different mmW frequencies have been designed, fabricated and tested. Using only 4 transistors, a 60 GHz amplifier is fabricated on a very small chip area of 0. 105 mm 2 by a low-cost 130 nm CMOS technology. A peak gain of 14. 7 dB and a noise figure of 6 dB are measured for this fabricated amplifier. <b>oreover,</b> it is shown that by further circuit optimization, high gain amplification can be realized at frequencies above the cut-off frequency of the transistor. Simulations show 32 and 28 dB gain can be obtained by implementing only 6 transistors using this CMOS technology at 60 and 77 GHz. A 4 -stage 85 GHz amplifier is also designed and fabricated and a measured gain of 10 dB at 82 GHz is achieved with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz from 80 to 91 GHz. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results verifies the accuracy of the design procedure. In addition, a multi-stage wide-band BPDA has been designed to show the ability of the proposed topology for design of wide band mmW amplifiers using the CMOS technology. Simulated gain of 20. 5 dB with a considerable 3 dB bandwidth of 38 GHz from 30 to 68 GHz is achieved while the noise figure is less than 6 dB in the whole bandwidth. An amplifier figure of merit is defined in terms of gain, noise figure, chip area, band width and power consumption. The results are compared to those of the state of the art to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed circuit topology and presented design techniques. Finally, a Rotman lens is designed and optimized by choosing a very small Focal Lens Ratio (FL), and a high measured efficiency of greater than 30 % is achieved while the lens dimensions are less than 6 mm. The lens is designed and implemented using a low cost Alumina substrate and conventional microstrip lines to ease its integration with the active parts of the system. 1 yea...|$|E

Estudos mostram que as metaloporfirinas paramagnÃÂticas tÃÂm apresentado resultados promissores como agentes de contraste em imagens por ressonÃÂncia magnÃÂtica nuclear. Em meio aquoso, estes compostos tÃÂm a capacidade de formar agregados moleculares que minimizam sua eficiÃÂncia para fins terapÃÂuticos. Portanto, o estudo das propriedades espectroscÃÂpicas de porfirina na presenÃÂa de sistemas biofÃÂsicos modelo pode subsidiar uma maior compreensÃÂo da interaÃÂÃÂo das porfirinas com tecidos existentes em meio fisiolÃÂgico. No presente trabalho, foram utilizadas tÃÂcnicas espectroscÃÂpicas para {{investigar}} a influÃÂncia do pH, forÃÂa iÃÂnica em duas porfirinas complexas com Cu 2 +: meso-tetrakis (N-metil- 4 -piridil),CuTMPyP e meso-tetrakis(2 -bipiridinil- 2 -cloro- 1 -rutÃÂnio) CuTPyP{Ru(bipy) 2 Cl} 4 e interaÃÂÃÂo destas com sistemas biofÃÂsicos modelo. Como modelo simplificado de membranas utilizou-se os surfactantes iÃÂnicos brometo de cetiltrimetilamÃÂnio (CTAB), dodecil sulfato de sÃÂdio (SDS) e o surfactante nÃÂo iÃÂnico ÃÂter estearÃÂlico de polioxietileno 20 (Brij 78) na forma micelar. Os espectros eletrÃÂnicos mostraram que o comportamento espectroscÃÂpico da CuTMPyP foi independente do pH e da forÃÂa iÃÂnica, pois variando-se o pH de 0, 5 a 13, 0 apenas uma espÃÂcie ÃÂ observada em soluÃÂÃÂo. Na presenÃÂa de surfactantes foi observado que devido a fatores eletrostÃÂticos nÃÂo hÃÂ uma interaÃÂÃÂo efetiva dessa porfirina com as micelas de CTAB e BRIJ 78. Entretanto, na presenÃÂa de SDS foi observada uma interaÃÂÃÂo efetiva entre a porfirina e as micelas de SDS. Com o aumento da concentraÃÂÃÂo de SDS em soluÃÂÃÂo observou-se um decrÃÂscimo gradual na intensidade da banda de Soret inicialmente centrada em 425 nm atÃÂ que a concentraÃÂÃÂo de SDS atinja 3, 12 x 10 - 4 mol. L- 1. Posteriormente a essa concentraÃÂÃÂo inicia-se um deslocamento espectral para comprimento de ondas maiores e a intensidade de absorÃÂÃÂo da banda de Soret passa a aumentar com o aumento da concentraÃÂÃÂo de SDS. Portanto, devido ÃÂ interaÃÂÃÂo preferencial com micelas aniÃÂnicas, ressalta-se a importÃÂncia do fator eletrostÃÂtico. Esses resultados foram confirmados por RPE e DCM. A estrutura hiperfina correspondente ao acoplamento com os quatros nitrogÃÂnios do anel macrocÃÂclico. NÃÂo foram identificadas mudanÃÂas em funÃÂÃÂo do pH nos ligantes axiais ao Cu. O valor calculado foi g 0 &# 8776; 2, 075. Para a porfirina CuTPyP{Ru(bipy) 2 Cl} 4 foram observadas trÃÂs espÃÂcies distintas em soluÃÂÃÂo, cujos valores de pH de transiÃÂÃÂo foram pK 1 = 3, 5 ÃÂ 0, 5 e pK 2 = 10, 6 ÃÂ 0, 6, para as formas diprotonada, monoprotonada e desprotonada. Neste caso, o comportamento espectral da porfirina sofre influÃÂncia da forÃÂa iÃÂnica, quando da presenÃÂa de NaCl com concentraÃÂÃÂo superior a 5, 9 x 10 - 1 mol. L- 1. NÃÂo hÃÂ interaÃÂÃÂes efetivas entre a porfirina e os surfactantes CTAB e Brij 78. Todavia, a uma intensa interaÃÂÃÂo com o surfactante aniÃÂnico. Um decrÃÂscimo da banda de Soret centrada em 417 nm foi observado com o aumento da concentraÃÂÃÂo de SDS em soluÃÂÃÂo atÃÂ uma concentraÃÂÃÂo igual a 5, 1 x 10 - 4 mol. L- 1. Posteriormente, um discreto efeito batocrÃÂmico foi observado. Cita-se novamente, a influÃÂncia dos fatores eletrostÃÂticos. Os resultados de DCM e RPE corroboram com os obtidos por UV-Vis. A estrutura hiperfina resultante da interaÃÂÃÂo do dos elÃÂtrons &# 960; delocalizados sobre os nÃÂcleos de nitrogÃÂnios foram observado apenas na presenÃÂa de micelas de SDS. Os espectros de RPE a 77 K apresentam simetria axial com g//&# 8776; 2. 345 e g&# 9524;&# 8776; 2. 026 na presenÃÂa e ausÃÂncia de micelas. Devido ÃÂ alta concentraÃÂÃÂo de ambas as porfirinas empregadas, apenas a forma livre da porfirina e sua interaÃÂÃÂo com micelas de SDS foram observadas atravÃÂs de DCM e RPE. Em suma, os fatores eletrostÃÂticos se apresentaram como o fator mais importante no processo de interaÃÂÃÂo das porfirinas. Porphyrins {{are very}} interesting because their favorables characteristics on biomedical applications. Paramagnetic metalloporphyrins {{have been studied}} and were exhibited promising results as contrast agents in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In aqueous medium, these compounds {{have the ability to}} form aggregates that minimize their effectiveness for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the investigation of properties of porphyrin in the presence of biological systems model can support {{a better understanding of the}} interaction of porphyrins with tissues in the blood. In the present study we used spectroscopic techniques, to investigated the influence of pH, ionic strength in the two porphyrins complexed with Cu 2 +: meso-tetrakis (N-methyl- 4 -pyridyl),CuTMPyP and meso-tetrakis(2 -bipyridinil- 2 -chlorine [...] ruthenium) CuTPyP{Ru(bipy) 2 Cl} 4, and their interaction with biological model systems. As model systems we used the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), the nonionic polyoxyethylene stearyl ether (20) (Brij 78) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in micellar form. The optical absorption showed that the CuTMPyP was insensitive in the pH range of 0, 5 to 13, 0 and only one specie was observed. This porphyrin were not influenced by ionic strength. No significant interaction of porphyrin with micelles of CTAB and Brij 78 were occurred. However, in the presence of SDS an effective interaction of porphyrin and SDS was observed. Optical spectra reveal a decrease of de Soret band at 425 nm with increasing SDS concentration until 3, 12 x 10 - 4 mol L- 1. Over this range there is a small red shift in the Soret band and its absorbance increasing with SDS concentration. In conclusion, due to preferential interaction with anionic micelles, the electrostatic factor seems to be more relevant. This result was confirmed by EPR and MCD results. A superhyperfine structure corresponds to four equally coupled nitrogens, i. e., nine lines pattern was observed. Then in the used pH range there is neither change in the binding of Cu in the porphyrin ring nor axial ligands exchanges. The value of g 0 &# 8776; 2, 075 was calculated. Three distinct species in solution equilibrium to the optical absorption spectrum for CuTPyP{Ru(bipy) 2 Cl} 4 were showed. The pK 1 = 3, 5 ÃÂ 0, 5 and pK 2 = 10, 6 ÃÂ 0, 6, whose forms are diprotonated, monoprotonated and no protonated were reported. In this case, the ionic strength above 5, 9 x 10 - 1 mol. L- 1 were denoted. No significant interaction of porphyrin with micelles of CTAB and Brij 78 were occurred again. However, there was a high interaction with anionic surfactant. A decrease of de Soret band at 417 nm with increasing SDS concentration until 5, 1 x 10 - 4 mol. L- 1 were observed. Thereafter, a small red shift in the Soret band and its absorbance increasing with SDS concentration were observed. One more time, the electrostatic factor was very relevant. The MCD and EPR were in agreement with this results. The hyperfine structure resulted from the interaction between delocalized &# 960; electron and N magnetic nuclei was just observed in presence of SDS micelles. EPR data at 77 K presented a typical axial spectrum with g// &# 8776; 2. 345 and g&# 9524; &# 8776; 2. 026 for all situations. Due to high concentration of both porphyrins used, only free form of porphyrin and theirself interaction of SDS micelles were observed in MCD and EPR spectra.
