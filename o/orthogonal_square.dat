Results on three chaotic time series show that the orthiogonal least squares algorithm is slightly inferior {{compared to the other}} three algorithms.

This thesis work targets the antenna diagnostics application for the GNSS antenna arrays. Two different types of inverse algorithms, a modal based technique and an equivalent source technique have been successfully implemented and verified. Resolution is a key factor for antenna diagnostics applications to be able to differentiate the different elements constituting the antenna array. To improve the resolution of the equivalent source method, surface weighing technique has been employed. Surface weighing is accomplished by using sinusoidal expansion and 2 D <b>orthogonal</b> <b>square</b> polynomials such as Chebyshev polynomials, Legendre polynomials and Zernike polynomials.

The mode frequencies and quality factors are also calculated by the finite-difference time-domain technique and Pade approximation method.

The decomposition of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>square</b> matrices in terms of Givens rotations defines a natural, interpretable framework for defining prior distributions over the sparsity structure of random eigenmatrices. We explore some theoretical aspects and implications for conditional independence graphical features arising in Gaussian models, and develop classes of priors over these matrices to underlie Bayesian modeling of resulting variance matrices. We discuss exploratory data analysis in this context, and define and implement Bayesian analysis based on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. This analysis is extended to the context of multivariate normal mixture models using the novel sparsity priors for variance matrices of the normal components, and this is applied in a study of a 20 −dimensional gene expression data set in breast cancer classification...|$|E

The variables studies were pretreatment temperature, duration, concentration, and dosage of sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

The results indicate that pretreatment best efficiency was attained with a temperature of 100 degrees C for 8 h at a concentration 3. 7 % solids and without NaOH.

40|$|Simulated "flights" {{over three}} {{different}} ground textures {{were used to}} examine people's ability to extract optical information useful for active regulation of altitude. The textures were regularly spaced lines as follows: 1) orthogonal to the direction of flight (latitude texture); 2) parallel to the direction of flight (meridian texture); and 3) both parallel and <b>orthogonal</b> (<b>square</b> texture). Visual constant velocity forward flight simulations were displayed on a CRT screen, and subjects asked to maintain one of three initial altitudes using a rate control stick. This task was made difficult {{by the presence of}} lateral (irrelevant) and vertical (relevant) "wind gusts. " The attitude never varied as winds, forward speed, and vertical rate control resulted in only translational movements. Adjusted root mean square errors (ARMSE) showed altitude regulation was more difficult at higher altitudes and when flying over meridian textures. Refined analysis of a single subject's data showed that this was due both to poorer regulation of the vertical wind disturbance and to a tendency to confuse the lateral wind disturbance for a vertical disturbance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Engineering, the {{identification}} of a linear statistical model is omnipresent (antenna array processing, factor analysis, etc). This problem has been extensively addressed since the fifties, refer e. g. to early contributions of Darmois and Skitovich. It consists of estimating a mixing matrix from observed realizations, {{under the assumption that}} the unobserved source random variables exciting the model are statistically independent. However, existence and uniqueness theorems were generally not constructive, {{in the sense that they}} did not yield practical algorithms. It is shown how such problems can be stated in terms of the decomposition of symmetric tensors into a sum of rank- 1 terms. For instance, Cumulant tensors have been used in different Engineering problems, and are symmetric as high-order derivatives of a multivariate scalar function. Various numerical algorithms are surveyed, and actually attempt to find a compromise between sub-optimality, numerical complexity, and simplicity. Principles underlying these algorithms are outlined, depending on the type of mixing matrix in the model: <b>orthogonal,</b> <b>square</b> invertible, or rectangular with full row rank. The case of square mixtures leads to approximate decompositions, whereas rectangular mixtures allow exact decompositions of so-called Under-determined Mixtures (UDM). It is pointed out during the course that some problems remain open. In some cases, the observation model itself is multi-linear, which may avoid to compute tensors (e. g. cumulants) from data. In that case, solutions become deterministic, and tensors to be decomposed generally do not enjoy symmetries...|$|E
