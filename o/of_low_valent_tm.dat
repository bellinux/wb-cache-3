40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{demonstrated that the}} photoactivity toward oxygen evolution {{of a number of}} n-type metal oxides can be substantially improved by a reductive electrochemical pretreatment. Such an enhancement has been primarily linked to the formation <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> metal species that increase electrode conductivity. In this work, we report new insights into the electrochemical doping using highly ordered (110) -oriented hematite nanorods directly grown on FTO. The reductive pretreatment consists in applying negative potentials for a controlled period of time. Such a pretreatment was optimized in both potentiostatic and potentiodynamic regimes. We show that the optimized pretreatment enhances electrode conductivity due to an increase in charge carrier density. However, it additionally triggers changes in the morphologic, catalytic and electronic properties that facilitate the separation and collection of the photogenerated charge carriers causing an up to 8 -fold enhancement in the photocurrent for water oxidation. The reductive pretreatment can be considered as a highly controllable electrochemical n-type doping with the amount of generated Fe 2 +/polaron species and the change in film morphology as the main factors determining the final efficiency for water photooxidation of the resulting electrodes.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} coordinating highly sterically demanding and strongly electron donating saturated N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) at late transition metal centres. 	 Chapter III details the synthesis {{of a range of}} iridium complexes of the type (NHC) 2 IrHxCly [x = 1, 2; y = 0, 1], bearing the saturated NHCs 5 -Mes, 6 -Mes and 7 -Mes. Unusually facile activation chemistry is observed in the reaction of [Ir(COE) 2 Cl] 2 with 6 -Mes and 7 -Mes to form the doubly cyclometallated species (6 -Mes') 2 IrH and (7 -Mes') 2 IrH, which were fully characterised. The responses of these complexes to the addition of dihydrogen and HCl were studied, leading to the controlled synthesis of range of precursors to 14 -electron iridium cations. 	 In Chapter IV the formation <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> iridium cations with weakly coordinating anions is targeted. Isolation of the cationic complexes [(NHC) (NHC') IrH][BArf 4] and [(NHC) 2 IrH 2][BArf 4] (NHC = 6 -Mes, 7 -Mes) showcases the stabilising power offered by these expanded ring systems. This allowed the study the interaction <b>of</b> these <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> species with a range of amine-borane substrates which are known to be readily dehydrogenated. Thermodynamic data on the C-H bond activation processes occurring at these iridium centres were able to be obtained due to facile, reversible oxidative addition of C-H bonds across the 14 -electron iridium. 	 Chapter V focuses on the effects of increasing the steric bulk of these NHCs to limit the coordination of multiple ligands at the metal centre. Use of 2, 6 -diisopropyl-phenyl (Dipp) groups on the expanded ring NHCs, instead of mesityl groups, leads to an unprecedented mode of reactivity with [Ir(COE) 2 Cl] 2. Activation and cleavage of C-N bonds in the carbene ring is observed, resulting in an open chain ligand chelating to the metal centre. Activation of the backbone in this manner has allowed the synthesis of saturated NHCs bearing a weakly coordinating anion on the ring. Here the first example of an anionic, saturated NHC is reported. 	 In Chapter VI these highly sterically demanding NHCs are exploited to stabilise active species in <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> gold chemistry. The extreme steric bulk of the 6 -Dipp ligand disfavours reduction of Au(I) to Au(0), however the resulting cation is observed to interact strongly with the weakly coordinating anion, [BArf 4]-. Thus, attempts were made to optimise the anion and conditions to isolate a catalytically relevant intermediate. The strong donating power of these expanded ring NHCs is also exploited to activate gold hydride complexes of the type (NHC) AuH (NHC = 6 -Dipp, 7 -Dipp). Analogues of [H 3]+ containing gold atoms ([{LAu} 2 H]+ and [LAuH 2]+) supported by expanded ring NHCs were also targeted. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>valent</b> nickel (less than + 1) {{complexes}} {{are rare}} in nature, however they are regularly encountered in nitridonickelate chemistry. Ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates exhibit {{a variety of}} interesting crystal structures {{with respect to their}} covalently bonded nitridonickelate anionic framework. The coordination geometry <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> nickel in these compounds presents a unique structural feature with nickel being in linear coordination by nitrogen atoms. The nitridonickelate frameworks of compounds investigated in this work are: Ba 2 [Ni 3 N 2]: The first ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates with 2 D Ni-N anionic network. The formal oxidation state of Ni is + 0. 67. Ba 2 (Ba 6 N) [NiN] 6 : The structure is made of o 1 D helical Ni-N anionic chains. Also, the structural stability of this compound´s structure type was found to occur over a wide range of substitution of Ba by Ca and Sr; a max. of 70 percent Ba could be successfully replaced by Sr and Ca atoms retaining the same structure type. The formal oxidation state of Ni is + 0. 83. Ba[NiN] and the solid solution series Ba[CuxNi 1 -xN]: The structure is made of 1 D zig-zag Ni-N chains. The solid-solution series is isostructural to Ba[NiN] at lower content of Cu while, at higher content it resembles Ba[CoN] structure type, however at very high Cu content it again transforms to Ba[NiN] structure type. The formal oxidation state of Ni is + 1. 0. Sr 2 [Ni(CN) N]: The structure consists of N-Ni-(CN) dumbbells. The compound is the first example of cyano-nitridonickelate. The formal oxidation state of Ni is 0. The handling of the ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates in specific and also of the other nitridometalates in general suffers greatly due to their being air and moisture sensitive. This requires synthetic methods suitable for air and moisture sensitive samples and also the respective instrumental setup for the measurement of their physical properties under inert atmosphere. Up to now no comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of the ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates has been made. In this work an emphasis was given to systematically investigate the physical properties of the ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates and to understand their structure specific physical properties. The common features of the investigated ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates are: 1. the <b>low</b> valency <b>of</b> nickel. 2. the linear coordination of Ni and octahedral coordination of N. During this investigation the <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> character <b>of</b> nickel was experimentally confirmed with the help of X-ray absorption spectroscopy and the interpretation of magnetic susceptibility data where the magnetic moments of the nickel atoms were always consistent with that <b>of</b> a <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> nickel species. The results obtained from the magnetic measurements and electrical conductivity shows that the alkaline earth nitridonickelates order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures and show temperature dependent metallic conductivity whereas the cyano-nitridonickelate Sr 2 [Ni(CN) N] does not order at low temperature, is paramagnetic, and exhibits semiconducting behaviour. This investigation has provided a better understanding of ternary alkaline earth nitridonickelates with respect to the different structure they exhibit and their associated physical properties. This work motivates to extend the investigations of the physical properties of other nitridometalates. These also exhibit different crystal structures with respect to their nitridometalate anionic framework and thus, structure specific physical properties are also to be expected...|$|R

40|$|A key {{question}} arising from {{studies on the}} corrosion behavior of molybdenum has been whether the passivation of molybdenum originates from a three-dimensional oxide film or from chemisorbed oxygen. In the present paper an alternative explanation for the apparent passivation behavior of molybdenum is given based on XPS measurements in combination with electrochemical techniques. Below the transpassive potential region, anodic current is obtained only if the sample has been cathodically activated and not after activation by ion etching. The experiments also show that the commonly used cathodic activation is insufficient to reduce the air-formed film. Thus, for such samples the anodic current in the apparent passive region {{could be due to}} oxidation <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> oxides on the surface. However, a transient anodic current is observed also for ion-etched samples that have been subjected to cathodic polarization In addition, impedance measurements show an unexpectedly large capacitance in the apparent passive region, indicating some kind of adsorption equilibrium at the metal-solution interface. This leads to the suggestion that hydrogen formed in the reduction process can diffuse into the molybdenum metal and cause a limiting oxidation of hydrogen upon positive polarization. Thus, in the apparent passive region the current is mainly due to oxidation of hydrogen and an extension of the transpassive corrosion yields a very low corrosion current for molybdenum. This is in agreement with the XPS experiments, where no more than a monolayer of oxidized molybdenum can be detected in the apparent passive region. (C) 2001 The Electrochemical Society. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} described {{within this}} thesis revolves around two central themes, the reactivity of phosphaalkynes towards various substrates, and the synthesis and further studies <b>of</b> novel <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> group 13 and group 14 element complexes. The first chapter provides a general introduction to important concepts and molecules {{pertinent to the}} studies discussed herein, and provides a brief overview {{into the history of}} phosphaalkynes. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of a series of 3 H- 1, 2, 3, 4 -triazaphospholes via a regiospecific pathway between phosphaalkynes and organic azides. Such [2 + 4] cycloadditions have shown marked similarities to Sharpless’s alkyne-azide click reactions, and had prompted interest in exploring them as high yielding routes in accessing new multidentate N/P ligands. Chapter 3 concentrates on coupling reactions between phosphaalkynes and amidinato stabilised group 14 element(I) dimers, as there were no examples of such reactions in the literature at the outset of this study.

40|$|The {{inspiration}} {{behind the}} synthesis and reactivity {{studies of the}} f-block metal complexes generally originated from several well defined basic purposes. The main goals {{in the field of}} lanthanide and actinide centered chemistry could be separated onto: (i) exploration of the fondamental chemistry of f-block elements with their reactivity and coordination behavior; (ii) understanding the nature of the bonding interactions between the metal centers and the ligands as well as between different metal centers within the same heterometallic complex; and finally, (iii) exploration of the possibility to use new complexes in catalytic or sensor related applications. This thesis is manly focused on the investigation of the preparation and the reactivity investigation <b>of</b> the several <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> compounds <b>of</b> Sm, <b>Tm,</b> U and Th with non-cyclopentadienyl ligands. Despite exceptionally high reactivity and rather unpredicted transformations demonstrated by some of the species in this class, an overall picture of the chemical activity remained rather scattered and considerably poorly investigated. In attempt to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} reactivity patterns in the field of f-block metal chemistry Chapter 2 of this thesis explored the chemical behavior of Sm complexes supported by the bulky aryloxides ligands. Application of the aluminum alkyls led to the appearance of a new coordination mode of aryloxide ligands to lanthanide, affording an unusually stable Sm(II) compounds. Attempted insertion reactions afforded several new complexes and provided more information about the stabilization influence of Lewis acids in zwitterionic compounds. The application of similar strategy to Sm(III) species resulted in the isolation of rare non-cyclopentadienyl single component ethylene polymerization catalyst. In Chapter 3 the reaction of Tm complexes supported by the combination of dimethyl-pyrrole with aluminum alkyl produced a very unusual product of C-H bond activation by the Tm metal center. Utilization of the Lewis acidic aluminum alkyls enforced the ligand to thulium pi-bonding and a formation of Zwitterionic structure. Upon treatment with hydrogen or PhSiH 3 as hydrogenating agent the initial species exhibited a series of very unusual transformations, leading to the isolation of rare case of SiH 3 coordination to thef-block metal center. Chapter 4 discovered unexpected reactivity of uranium complex with bulky amido-ligand in halogen replacement alkylation processes or during the reduction of the metal center. The alkylation reactions yielded extensive gamma-deprotonation and formation of cluster compounds. Two first structurally characterized uranium carbines were discovered and documented in the course of this exploratory work. Reduction of the mixed Uranium amido-halogenates proceeded with the formation <b>of</b> transient <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> species and immediate re-oxidation at the expense of the ligand, affording new amido-imino- or amido-alkyl-complexes of U(V). Multiple attempts of lowering the oxidation state of uranium metal center supported by new bis-amido-benzene ligand, presented in Chapter 5, resulted in the isolation of several new solvent fragmentation products. The reactivity displayed by the related ligand systems together with the additional support, provided by the isolation of complexes of this type, suggested the presence <b>of</b> highly reactive <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> synthons. Reduction reactions afforded the new uranium complex with the lowest reported oxidation state of the metal centers. However, the DFT calculations revealed that all the excessive electron density was situated on the ligand delocalized pi-systems, forcing the ligand to act as electron storage. Chapter 6 discussed the possibility of sterically enforcing pi-bonding ligands to stabilize the <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> oxidation state <b>of</b> Th metal center. Utilization of the bis-pyrrolide base ligand allowed the isolation of the thorium complex with significant pi-interaction of the metal center with the aromatic system of the ligand. Reduction of this system afforded the isolation of the rare example of Th(III) complex. Similarly to the complexes of U reported in the previous chapter, DFT calculation displayed significant presence of the electronic density on the pi-system of the ligand fragment.

The origins and properties of these compounds are first outlined, and a summary of methods previously used to synthesise the 14 -membered cembranoid ring system is then given. In connection with a synthetic programme towards cembranoids, based on a radical macrocyclisation as the key step, a number of suitable radical precursors were prepared and their radical macrocyclisations were attempted. Cyclisation via electropinacolisation of the α,ω-dialdehyde (69) {{was found to be}} an unsuitable method. Similarly, attempts at a reductive cyclisation of the acetylenic aldehyde (70) also proved unsuccessful. A modified precursor, the halo-enone (118) possessing an activated olefin function, was then chosen. This precursor also failed to cyclise on radical initiation. Ultimately it was found necessary to design the radical precursor such that the β-position of the activated olefin was unsubstituted. In order to favour the required macrocyclisation. Thus the 14 -membered cembranoid type ring was eventually prepared by radical cyclisation of the allylic iodo-dienone (127) to give the cyclic enone (132). This preparation then constituted a formal synthesis of the natural cembranolide (37). Despite other possible modes of cyclisation this particular allylic radical cyclisation was found to give selectively only the 14 -membered product as a mixture of 10 E- and 10 Z-isomers. Attempts to extend this methodology, to include an epoxide function in the substrate, proved unsuccessful. Finally a convenient synthesis of the natural cembranoid mukulol (41) is described, using a radical macrocyclisation of the iodo-dienone (149) to give the cyclic enone (148) as the key step. In the appendix an investigation <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> titanium mediated couplings as a means of preparing dihydrothiophenes and dihydrofurans is described. The diketo ether (184) was found not to cyclise under any conditions. Conversely the diketothioether (176) was found to cyclise to give a cyclic diol (178). We were unable to subsequently convert the diol to the corresponding dihydrothiophene...|$|R
40|$|The study {{involves}} synthetic approaches {{towards the}} preparation of novel NHC complexes <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> rhenium and manganese transition metals. Diverse methods of synthesis were studied. The direct approach, in which the ylidene obtained from deprotonation of 1, 3 -bis(2, 4, 6 - trimethylphenyl) imidazolium chloride {{was added to the}} metal substrate, proved to be unsuccessful as isolation of the free carbene should rather be performed in an argon filled glove box under extreme inert conditions. By way of further investigation the ylidene was prepared by in situ methods and then quenched with the metal substrate. Different bases for deprotonation purposes and reaction conditions were explored. All routes employed were investigated and compared using group VII transition metal substrates Re(CO) 5 Br, Mn(CO) 5 Br, Re 2 (CO) 10 and Mn 2 (CO) 10. Isolation and purification of these products proved to be very challenging due to the insolubility in some organic solvents with consequent problematic spectroscopic analyses of the complexes. The tendency of the products to undergo various side reactions is observed in all reactions. Specifically, hydrolysis of the imidazolium ligand, followed by vinyl formation, yielded the mesitylformamide compound (3). The results obtained for some of the monometal substrates indicated that the target complexes were formed but could not be isolated. However, the synthesis route employing deprotonation by nBuLi as base and [Mn 2 (CO) 10] as dimetal substrate lead to the isolation of the target dinuclear complex [Mn 2 (CO) 9 IMes] (9). Other novel complexes obtained {{during the course of this}} study include the biscarbene tetrarhenium complex [Re 2 (CO) 9. C(OEt) C 4 H 2 OC(OEt) Re 2 (CO) 9] (12) and various side reaction products. In many cases, metal-metal bond cleavage and carbonyl insertion was observed, as is evident in the complex IMesH[ReO 4] (6) and ketene product (13). Structural and theoretical studies were performed to investigate the bond character between the carbene ligand and the metal. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{unprecedented}} organoiron complexes {{of the formal}} oxidation states − 2, 0, + 1, + 2, and + 3 is presented, which are largely devoid of stabilizing ligands and, in part, also electronically unsaturated (14 -, 16 -, 17 - and 18 -electron counts). Specifically, it is shown that nucleophiles unable to undergo β-hydride elimination, such as MeLi, PhLi, or PhMgBr, rapidly reduce Fe(3 +) to Fe(2 +) and then exhaustively alkylate the metal center. The resulting homoleptic organoferrate complexes [(Me 4 Fe) (MeLi) ][Li(OEt 2) ] 2 (3) and [Ph 4 Fe][Li(Et 2 O) 2][Li(1, 4 -dioxane) ] (5) could be characterized by X-ray crystal structure analysis. However, these exceptionally sensitive compounds {{turned out to be}} only moderately nucleophilic, transferring their organic ligands to activated electrophiles only, while being unable to alkylate (hetero) aryl halides unless they are very electron deficient. In striking contrast, Grignard reagents bearing alkyl residues amenable to β-hydride elimination reduce FeX n (n = 2, 3) to clusters of the formal composition [Fe(MgX) 2] n. The behavior of these intermetallic species can be emulated by structurally well-defined lithium ferrate complexes of the type [Fe(C 2 H 4) 4][Li(tmeda) ] 2 (8), [Fe(cod) 2][Li(dme) ] 2 (9), [CpFe(C 2 H 4) 2][Li(tmeda) ] (7), [CpFe(cod) ][Li(dme) ] (11), or [Cp*Fe(C 2 H 4) 2][Li(tmeda) ] (14). Such electron-rich complexes, which are distinguished by short intermetallic Fe−Li bonds, were shown to react with aryl chlorides and allyl halides; the structures and reactivity patterns of the resulting organoiron compounds provide first insights into the elementary steps <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> iron-catalyzed cross coupling reactions of aryl, alkyl, allyl, benzyl, and propargyl halides with organomagnesium reagents. However, the acquired data suggest that such C−C bond formations can occur, a priori, along different catalytic cycles shuttling between metal centers of the formal oxidation states Fe(+ 1) /Fe(+ 3), Fe(0) /Fe(+ 2), and Fe(− 2) /Fe(0). Since these different manifolds are likely interconnected, an unambiguous decision as to which redox cycle dominates in solution remains difficult, even though iron complexes <b>of</b> the <b>lowest</b> accessible formal oxidation states promote the reactions most effectively...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes the synthesis, structure and stability {{of a range of}} halido, hydrido and heterocyclic complexes of the group 13 elements. The underlying theme is the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> group 13 complexes. The work upon this subject is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to the members of group 13 and to low oxidation state group 13 halide chemistry. The history of binary group 13 metal trihydride complexes and the reasons behind their inherent instability are also discussed. Chapter 2 details the use of a stable nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbene, l, 3 -bis(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene. (IPr), and nitrogen donor ligands, namely a bulky diazabutadiene (Ar-DAB), Ar = 2. 6 -Pr' 2 C 6 H 3. quinuclidine and formamidinate, in the formation of group 13 trihalide complexes. A series of metal trihalide complexes have been prepared and characterised, e. g. InBr 3 (L). L = IPr or Ar-DAB, whose reduction reactions with alkali metals did not yield <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> metal metal bonded group 13 species. In addition, the reactivity of "Gal" towards pyridine based ligands is described: 'Gal* reacts, for example, with 2. 2 '-bipyridine (bipy) to give salts of composition Ga(bipy) 3 I 3, ((bipy) 2 Ga} 2 (u-OH) 2 : Ga 2 l 6 l 6 or {(bipy) 2 Ga 2 (u-OH) 2 I 4. depending upon the reaction conditions. All new compounds have been crystallographically characterised.

In addition, the synthesis of the second example of an anionic gallium(I) N-heterocyclic carbene analogue. {(TMEDA) KGa(Ar-DAB) } 2, is described. This complex displays a Ga Ga interaction in the solid state which is unprecedented for this complex type. Chapter 4 lists reactivity studies of a new gallium(I) carbene analogue, {(TMEDA) KGa(Ar-DAB) } 2. towards main group halide complexes. These studies led to some decomposition products which are paramagnetic and have been studied both crystallographically and by EPR spectroscopy. The reactivity of the gallium carbene analogue towards sources of oxygen has been investigated and the complex, ((u- 0) Ga(Ar-DAB) 2 } 2 2 from the reaction with N 2 O. has been isolated and structurally characterised. In addition, an unprecedented 7 t-cyclopentadienyl bridged digallane complex, {Ga(Ar-DAB) 2 h{u-CpK(TMEDA) 2 }. incorporating the first structurally characterized -interaction with a Ga(II) center, results from the oxidative coupling of an anionic gallium(I) heterocycle with cyclopentadienyl thallium(I).

These include the preparation and characterisation of the first examples of amido indium hydride complexes, one of which has unprecedented thermal stability. In addition, these studies led to the first covalently bonded metal complexes derived from an anionic gallium carbene analogue, one of which, InH 2 {Ga(Ar-DAB) } 2 Li(TMEDA) 2, contains the first example of a structurally authenticated In Ga bond.
