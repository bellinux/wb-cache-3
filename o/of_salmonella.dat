5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>salmonella</b> in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E
25|$|Asymptomatic {{subclinical}} infection may help spread these diseases, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, V. cholerae, and Yersini. For example, as of 1984 {{it was estimated}} that in the United States, 200,000 people were asymptomatic carriers <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in contrasting environments {{was compared}} in this study. Samples collected from or near surface waters in a lush hardwood forest yielded four salmonellae serotypes from six culturally positive samples. A total of 76 samples {{collected from the}} top of a granite outcropping over a 3 -month period yielded 10 positive samples. Only two salmonellae serotypes were isolated, and one of these was isolated only once. The nature of the sample material had no significant effect on the detection <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> from the two sampling sites. However, {{the presence or absence of}} visible moisture in the sample significantly affected the recovery <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae.</b> The results showed that even a harsh environment such as that found on top of Stone Mountain may serve as an ecological niche for the survival and transmission <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> a {{relatively}} large inoculum of 1 million to 1 billion organisms is necessary to produce symptoms in healthy human volunteers, as Salmonellae {{are very sensitive to}} acid. An unusually high stomach pH level (low acidity) greatly reduces the number of bacteria required to cause symptoms by a factor of between 10 and 100.|$|E
25|$|Typhoid: Normal CFTR {{proteins}} {{are also}} {{essential for the}} entry <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Typhi into cells, suggesting that carriers of mutant CFTR genes might be resistant to typhoid fever. No in vivo study has yet confirmed this. In both cases, {{the low level of}} cystic fibrosis outside of Europe, in places where both cholera and typhoid fever are endemic, is not immediately explicable.|$|E

Lighter than the typical MRE, they require no preparation and allow servicemembers to eat them while traveling. In July 2009, 6,300 dairy shake packets of varying flavors were recalled due to evidence <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> contamination.|$|E
40|$|Various {{sampling}} {{techniques to}} determine the aerobic, E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae counts and to detect the presence <b>of</b> <b>salmonellas</b> were compared. As a simple method for the detection <b>of</b> <b>salmonellas</b> a modified Surkeiwicz procedure using both drip and rinse water is advocated.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for the enumeration <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in polluted waters using several modifications of existing techniques. Confirmation <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> is achieved within 48 hr. This procedure includes selective enrichment in m-Tetrathionate Broth (22 ± 1 hr), plating on Brilliant Green Sulfa Agar (20 ± 1 hr), and confirmation by flagellar (H) agglutination of the growth in a mannosecontaining medium (6 ± 1 hr). An incubation temperature of 41. 5 C was used throughout this procedure. Dilution to extinction techniques (most probable number) were employed to enumerate salmonellae. Large sample volumes were concentrated {{through the use of}} membrane filters. This technique proved to be rapid and reliable for the enumeration <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in water, waste water, and waste-water sludges...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} over a 2 -year period {{to determine the extent}} to which a poultry processing plant served as a reservoir <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> reaching the external environment, to examine the question of the importance <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in the environment, and to consider how best to control the spread of the organisms. The studies have been undertaken at a chicken processing plant handling between 75, 000 and 80, 000 birds per day. Populations <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> and indicator bacteria were estimated in the raw wastes, through the waste treatment plant, and in the receiving stream waters. The results demonstrate that salmonellae are present in poultry processing wastes in a surprisingly constant relation to fecal coliforms (in excess <b>of</b> 1 <b>Salmonella</b> per 500 fecal coliforms), that serotypes in the environment are constantly changing, and that they may reflect unusual conditions in the processing plant, or a possible source of infection among human and animal residents of the environment. Disinfection of poultry processing wastes is recommended...|$|R
25|$|A type III {{secretion}} system {{means that}} a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella,</b> Shigella, Yersinia) can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in Y. pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.|$|E
25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is Salmonella. Large amounts <b>of</b> <b>salmonella</b> contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% <b>of</b> <b>salmonella</b> strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E
25|$|To design optimal {{growth media}} {{with respect to}} {{enhanced}} growth rates or useful by-product secretion, {{it is possible to}} use a method known as Phenotypic Phase Plane analysis. PhPP involves applying FBA repeatedly on the model while co-varying the nutrient uptake constraints and observing the value of the objective function (or by-product fluxes). PhPP makes it possible to find the optimal combination of nutrients that favor a particular phenotype or a mode of metabolism resulting in higher growth rates or secretion of industrially useful by-products. The predicted growth rates of bacteria in varying media have been shown to correlate well with experimental results. as well as to define precise minimal media for the culture <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> typhimurium.|$|E

2500|$|A {{possible}} risk of raw feeding is that {{of human}} infection caused by direct or indirect exposure to bacterial pathogens in raw meat and animal stools.

Brilliant Green Agar was used throughout as the recovery medium. Although the lactose pre-enrichment methodology promoted Salmonella recovery from samples containing small numbers of dormant organisms, the efficiency of this enrichment method is adversely affected by unfavorable coliform-Salmonella ratios. Under such conditions, early subculture of lactose broth into selenite broth is indicated. Selenite broth containing 10 % sterile feces was more efficient than the lactose pre-enrichment methodology in promoting the growth <b>of</b> “dormant” <b>salmonellae.</b> Albumen adversely affected recovery <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> from selenite broth, whereas whole egg and egg yolk enhanced Salmonella recovery from this medium.
