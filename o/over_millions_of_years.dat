5|$|Numerical {{studies have}} shown that <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> the general nature of the {{alignment}} between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto's stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> as {{appears to be the}} case for Mars.|$|E
5|$|Models for a {{continuous}} formation throughout {{the age of}} the Solar System illustrate that at weak resonances within the Kuiper belt (such as 5:7 or 8:1), or at the boundaries of stronger resonances, objects can develop weak orbital instabilities <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The 4:7 resonance in particular has large instability. KBOs can also be shifted into unstable orbits by close passage of massive objects, or through collisions. Over time, the scattered disc would gradually form from these isolated events.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> {{to the form}} {{in which they are}} found today. The {{original}} ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
5|$|The 2:3 {{resonance}} {{between the}} two bodies is highly stable, and is preserved <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide. The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull {{between the two}} causes angular momentum {{to be transferred to}} Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to Kepler's third law. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.|$|E
50|$|Although from a {{distance}} the Sierran rock looks quite similar, it is actually made up of many individual rock bodies that formed from repeated intrusions <b>of</b> magma <b>over</b> many <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chalk {{as seen in}} Cretaceous {{deposits}} of Western Europe is unusual among sedimentary limestones in {{the thickness of the}} beds. Most cliffs of chalk have very few obvious bedding planes unlike most thick sequences of limestone such as the Carboniferous Limestone or the Jurassic oolitic limestones. This presumably indicates very stable conditions <b>over</b> tens <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|R
25|$|The active {{front of}} a {{volcanic}} arc is the belt where volcanism develops at a given time. Active fronts may move <b>over</b> time (<b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years),</b> changing their distance from the oceanic trench {{as well as their}} width.|$|R
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E
5|$|When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. <b>Over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii hotspot is a {{volcanic}} hotspot {{located near the}} namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean. One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume {{is responsible for the}} creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres (3,600mi) long. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant, and more than 123 are extinct, many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii {{to the edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries. The classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that hotspots are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's.|$|E
5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped <b>over</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|R

50|$|The {{combined}} continents of Africa and the Americas split {{apart from}} the combined continent of Pangea during the Triassic Period. A small rift was opened in the Farmville area into which water flowed and allowed for wetland life.

5|$|This {{cycle of}} growth and {{dormancy}} strings together volcanoes <b>over</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> {{leaving a trail of}} volcanic islands and seamounts across the ocean floor. According to Wilson's theory, the Hawaiian volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot, and this is easily observable; the oldest rock in the main Hawaiian islands, that of Kauai, is about 5.5 million years old and deeply eroded, while the rock on Hawaii island is a comparatively young 0.7 million years of age or less, with new lava constantly erupting at Kīlauea, the hotspot's present center. Another consequence of his theory is that the chain's length and orientation serves to record the direction and speed of the Pacific Plate's movement. A major feature of the Hawaiian trail is a sudden 60° bend at a 40- to 50-million-year-old section of its length, and according to Wilson's theory, this is evidence of a major change in plate direction, one that would have initiated subduction along much of the Pacific Plate's western boundary. This part of the theory has recently been challenged, and the bend might be attributed to the movement of the hotspot itself.|$|E

5000|$|In therapsids (mammal {{ancestors}} and their kin), the lower jaw {{is made up}} of the dentary (the mandible in mammals) and a group of smaller [...] "postdentary" [...] bones near the jaw joint. As the dentary increased in size <b>over</b> <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> two <b>of</b> these postdentary bones, the articular and angular, became increasingly reduced and the dentary eventually made direct contact with the upper jaw. These postdentary bones, even before their articular function was lost, probably transmitted sound vibrations to the stapes and, in some therapsids, a bent plate that might have supported a membrane capable of detecting vibrations developed on the angular. Eventually, it developed into the ectotympanic ring which supports the tympanic membrane in the ears of modern mammals.|$|R
