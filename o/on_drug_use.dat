Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E

500|$|Since their movement's {{emergence}} {{early in}} the 20th century, Pentecostals saw themselves as [...] "peculiar people", {{and one of the}} components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior. Prohibitions <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> gambling, social dancing, consuming alcohol, smoking, attending theaters, bowling, swimming in public pools and beaches, owning television sets, and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from the larger society. Starting in the 1950s, attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change. The most change probably occurred over views on women's attire, with the former stance against wearing make-up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion. Most of these [...] "holiness standards" [...] are no longer adhered to; however, some are still held to, such as proscriptions on smoking, alcohol and drug use.|$|E

[...] "The Prayer" [...] is based <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> during nights out in clubs, while [...] "On" [...] specifies the effects and after-effects of cocaine. Okereke tried to treat the tracks as explanations of people's actions, rather than moralising tales; he has stated, [...] "In a time when so many people feel they can't communicate or feel hemmed in, I can see the appeal of cocaine." [...] "Sunday" [...] details the morning-after hangover following a drunken and promiscuous night out, while [...] "SRXT" [...] {{takes the form of}} a suicide note following the loneliness and despair of hedonism in the metropolis. The album closer is named after Seroxat, a trade name for the antidepressant paroxetine, and was crafted following the suicide attempts of two of Okereke's friends after they left university in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Misuse, problem use, abuse, {{and heavy}} {{use of alcohol}} refer to {{improper}} use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as {{no more than two}} alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey <b>on</b> <b>Drug</b> <b>Use</b> and Health found that only 10% of either [...] "heavy drinkers" [...] or [...] "binge drinkers" [...] defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates how family {{structure}} {{is associated with}} adolescent <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and how parenting, peer use, religiosity, and neighborhood prob-lems may mediate the relationship.
