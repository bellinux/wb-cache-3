5|$|From 1916 {{through her}} {{retirement}} in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co-chair. Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E

5|$|The Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>household</b> and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to {{all areas of}} traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>household</b> drug {{supplies and}} self-medication practice among medical and pharmacy students at Zagreb University in 2001, and {{to relate the}} findings to a previous survey in 1977. Methods A cross-sectional anonymous questionnaire-based survey included 287 students who inventoried drug supplies in their family <b>households</b> and interviewed <b>the</b> <b>household</b> members on drug keeping and self-medication practice. An identical methodology was used in 1977 (n= 225). Results In 2001, healthcare professionals were present in 37 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surveyed <b>households</b> (33 % in 1977). At least one drug was found in every household. Drugs were kept at a designated place (“home phar-macy”) in 68 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> (65 % in 1977). Drugs past expiry dates and/or with purpose un-known to <b>the</b> <b>household</b> members were reported in 27 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> (32 % in 1977). The most frequently found drugs were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that were present in 97 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> (93 % in 1977), and were followed by antibiotics found in 46 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> (40 % in 1977). Self-medication of NSAIDs was practiced in 88 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> {{in which they were}} found (95 % in 1977), whereas self-medication of antibiotics was practiced in 37 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> in which they were found (41 % in 1977).

30|$|Our {{estimates}} {{show that}} about 66 and 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> in <b>the</b> sample were food secure {{based on a}} single indicator such as FOODexp and DDS, respectively.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with analyzing <b>the</b> consumption patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> in Erzurum, providing efficient estimates for the models related to the income hypotheses, viz., absolute income, relative income, permanent income, and life cycle hypotheses, comparing parameter estimates implied by the different models, and choosing one <b>of</b> them as <b>the</b> best model which explaines <b>the</b> consumption tendency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> by using <b>the</b> <b>Household</b> Survey Data conducted by the author for the year 1991. <b>The</b> major findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis reveal that Engel's law is also valid in Erzurum, that besides income, demographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>households</b> such as occupation, education are important factors affecting the consumption, that climate has a special importance in explaining the consumption, and that the linear model is the best.
