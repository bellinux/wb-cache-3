5|$|Songs <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American {{composer}} and producer David Axelrod, released in October 1969 by Capitol Records. It was composed, arranged, and produced by Axelrod, who worked with session musicians such as guitarist Al Casey, drummer Earl Palmer, and conductor Don Randi. As with his 1968 debut album Song of Innocence, Axelrod composed musical interpretations of English poet William Blake's Songs of Innocence and <b>of</b> <b>Experience,</b> an 18th-century illustrated collection of poems.|$|E

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> a negative event compared to their actual chance <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> an event and other's risk <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> the same event.|$|R

The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song of Innocence. Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E

However, capturing perceptions and/or memories <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> is far from easy. Much of consumers 2 ̆ 7 thinking occurs in their unconscious and only surfaces through metaphors and stories; yet, most research practices wrongly assume that consumers {{have easy access to}} memories or attitudes and can readily explain their thinking and behaviors (Zaltman, 2003). The challenge of capturing perceptions and memories <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> is especially apparent for sensory aspects <b>of</b> <b>experiences,</b> as a lot of sensory information is unconsciously processed. Sensory descriptions or depictions <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> are critical in the context of experiential marketing but are difficult to formulate if the sensory essence <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> as perceived by the consumers is unknown and cannot be easily captured through traditional research approaches...|$|R

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization <b>of</b> <b>Experience</b> (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{different aspects of}} perfectionism in athletes (N = 388) related to the different fears of failure proposed by Conroy et al.

Results showed that perfectionistic personal standards showed a negative relationship with fear <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> shame and embarrassment and a positive relationship with positive affect after success, whereas perfectionistic concern over mistakes and perceived parental pressure showed a positive relationship with fear <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> shame and embarrassment and with negative affect after failure. Moreover, fear <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> shame and embarrassment fully mediated the relationship between perfectionistic concern and negative affect and between coach pressure and negative affect. The findings demonstrate that fear <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> shame and embarrassment is central in the perfectionism-fear of failure relationship and that perfectionistic concern about mistakes and perceived coach pressure are aspects of perfectionism that predict fear <b>of</b> <b>experiencing</b> shame and embarrassment and negative affect after failure...|$|R

Inductees must have at least 15 years <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years <b>of</b> <b>experience.</b> To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region.
