50|$|With {{the growth}} of the steel mills, Ambridge became a {{worldwide}} leader in steel production. The borough became known for bridge building, metal molding, and the manufacture of tubes (large iron pipes). During World War II, the American Bridge Company fabricated steel for the building of LSTs (Landing Ship Tanks). The steel was then sent by rail to the adjacent American Bridge naval shipyard in Leetsdale, PA where the LSTs were built. The area was also home to several other steel mills like Armco, the pipe mill which manufactured <b>oil</b> <b>piping,</b> and A.M. Byers, a major iron and tool fabricator. Eventually competition by foreign steel producers began to cause the share of the steel market for U.S. manufacturers to dwindle. With the shift of steel production overseas, the American Bridge Company ended operations in Ambridge in 1983. The legacy of American Bridge can be seen today in bridges around the world.|$|E

Circumferential TIG welding is widely used in industries such as <b>piping,</b> <b>oil</b> refineries, power stations, etc. The 3 D numerical simulation ANSYS code is used to predict the residual stress distribution developed during circumferential TIG welding. Due to non-uniform distribution of plastic and thermal strains in and around the weld pool, large amounts of residual stresses and deformations are present in all welded structures. The simulated results are validated using experimental results available in the literature. The effects of welding current and pipe thickness on residual stress and temperature fields at different locations were assessed...|$|R
40|$|Many thermal {{solar power}} plants use thermal oil as heat {{transfer}} fluid, and molten salts as thermal energy storage. Oil absorbs energy from sun light, and transfers it to a water-steam cycle across heat exchangers, to be converted into electric energy {{by means of a}} turbogenerator, or to be stored in a thermal energy storage system {{so that it can be}} later transferred to the water-steam cycle. The complexity of these thermal solar plants is rather high, as they combine traditional engineering used in power stations (water-steam cycle) or petrochemical (<b>oil</b> <b>piping),</b> with the new solar (parabolic trough collector) and heat storage (molten salts) technologies. With the engineering of these plants being relatively new, regulation of the thermal energy storage system is currently achieved in manual or semiautomatic ways, controlling its variables with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulators. This makes the overall performance of these plants non optimal. This work focuses on energy storage systems based on molten salt, and defines a complete model of the process. By defining such a model, the ground for future research into optimal control methods will be established. The accuracy of the model will be determined by comparing the results it provides and those measured in the molten-salt heat storage system of an actual power plant...|$|E

This research investigates {{the effect of a}} thin, deposited layer of Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr on carbon steel in terms of wear and corrosion properties. The microstructure of the HVOF-sprayed Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr coating was characterized at each step by scanning electron microscopy. Wear testing was performed with a pin-on-disk tester. Wear weight loss was examined by applying different loads over a 9048. 96 m sliding distance. Experimental results show that the wear resistance of the coated sample reduced the risk of seizure compared to the uncoated sample. An electrochemical test was also performed and the behavior of the substrate in the coated sample was investigated in 3. 5 NaCl for 27 days. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the HVOF coating has high corrosion resistance and protects the substrate from NaCl electrolyte penetration.

40|$|Case StudyA dry screw {{compressor}} skid was fabricated for offshore service that included oil buffered mechanical seals on the compressor. During shop testing, excessive seal <b>oil</b> <b>piping</b> vibration was observed {{that resulted in}} pipe component failures. The oil system was designed to include a common lube and seal oil system with a pump design pressure of 590 psi. There were six oil control valves on the system, including a lube oil pressure control valve, one flow control valve on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow control valve on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure control valve for the oil system. Vibration and pressure pulsation measurements indicated that the response was at the pocket pass frequency of 206 Hz. The source was determined to be at the compressor. Arrangement of the control valves and control sensing lines were likely contributors to the severity of the response. Modification to the seal oil system included addition of several volumes at strategic locations to change the acoustical characteristics of the oil system to reduce the shaking forces in the pipe system. These changes along with pipe support modifications and changes to the control valve sensing lines were successful at reducing the pipe pulsations and vibration response to acceptable levels...|$|E

In particular, a typical industrial piping system, containing several critical components, such as elbows, a bolted flange joint and a Tee joint, was tested under different levels of realistic earthquake loading. They corresponded to serviceability and ultimate limit states for support structures as suggested by modern performance-based earthquake engineering standards. The so called hybrid simulation techniques namely, pseudo-dynamic and real time testing with dynamic substructuring, were adopted to perform seismic tests. Experimental results displayed a favorable performance of the piping system and its components; they remained below their yielding, allowable stress and allowable strain limits without any leakage even at the Near Collapse limit state condition for the support structure. Moreover, the favourable comparison between experimental and numerical results, proved the validity of the proposed hybrid techniques alternative to shaking table tests...|$|R

40|$|A {{unit was}} {{constructed}} {{for the study}} of film heat transfer coefficients of a heavy fuel oil in viscous or streamline flow. The heat exchanger was of the shell and tube type, having extended longitudinal steel fins welded to the tube. Auxiliary equipment consisted of an oil pump, <b>oil</b> storage reservoirs, <b>piping,</b> and means for measurement of temperatures and oil flow rates. The unit was operated both as a fin type heat exchanger with the oil in contact with the finned surfaces, and as a straight tube and shell exchanger with the oil on the tube side. Oil flow rates and temperatures were varied over a wide range. The data obtained was calculated by the means of existing empirical equations, and the results were compared with those of previous investigators and with the proposed correlations by plotting. The experimentally determined film coefficients obtained on the exchanger when operated as a fin type were found to be in agreement with the best existing correlation. Coefficients determined on the straight tube and shell exchanger were found to be forty per cent higher than the values predicted by this correlation. A comparison was drawn between the exchanger as a fin type and as a shell and tube type. The fin type was found to transfer approximately four hundred per cent as much heat per unit length of exchanger as did the straight shell and tube type. It is believed that a considerable saving would be effected by the use of a fin type exchanger in any application of heat transfer in which one fluid film definitely controlled the rate of heat transfer...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{facilities}} by {{and large}} did not exist before {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century, when the first submarine cables were snaked across the world 2 ̆ 7 s oceans. Likewise, platforms exploiting undersea resources, most notably oil and gas, did not exist until the middle of the twentieth century, with World War II providing the spur for states to overcome the technological challenges in exploiting the sea bed, and <b>piping</b> <b>oil</b> and gas across the ocean floor. For Australia and New Zealand these developments have been of tremendous impact. Since the nineteenth century, submarine cables connected the two states to the rest of the world, allowing communication times to be reduced from weeks and months to days, hours and ultimately virtually instantaneously. Today the bulk of telecommunications traffic, including telephone and internet, travels via submarine cable, and for Australia it is worth 5 billion to the national economy. Oil and gas platforms have allowed exploitation of substantial petroleum deposits to the extent that well over 80 per cent of such production in Australia, and virtually all of it in New Zealand, is produced in offshore fields. As such, the loss or disruption for an extended period of oil and gas supplies from offshore, or the severing of submarine communication links, would have a catastrophic effect on the economies of Australia and New Zealand. This underlies the importance of the protective regimes that exist internationally and domestically to protect these facilities from interference. This chapter considers the regime for the in situ protection of offshore facilities from terrorist attack, including platforms, pipelines and submarine cables under international, Australian and New Zealand law. Thile relevant to an overall strategy to combat terrorism, broader regulatory mechanisms such as the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code 1 will not be considered...|$|R

40|$|Civilisation has {{depended}} on welded structures to facilitate production {{and improve the}} quality of life. Welds are used to create infrastructure upon which we rely, such as transportation, <b>oil</b> and gas <b>piping,</b> shipbuilding, bridges and buildings, and to produce the equipment that makes all of this happen. In short, the joining of two metals through welding has immensely contributed to our society. A critical factor in the strength of welded joints is the geometry of the joints, and for this reason a robust optimisation of geometrical parameters of welded joints has been conducted in order to establish the optimum and most robust design in the presence of variation amongst geometrical parameters. A parametric finite element analysis, using Python script, has been performed with the objective to investigate the effect of the welded joint parameters on the stress concentration factors under tensile and bending load. The results indicate that the parametric model, which is generated by Python script, {{can be used in a}} wide range of welded geometry, and has the capacity to reduce the time of computation. Additionally, an experimental study, including the geometrical identification of the welded joints, tensile test, hardness test and fatigue, has also been performed. In order to select the best optimisation algorithms, different optimisation algorithms and performance metrics with various types of problem were examined in this study. The results from this part show the accuracy of Circumscription Metric (CM) in comparison to Pair wise Metric (PW) - which is used widely in optimisation studies. Furthermore, the results show that the Fast Multi-objective Optimisation Algorithm (FMOGA-II) outperformed other optimisation algorithms used during this study. In this study, a new methodology for selecting the most robust designs from within the Pareto set has been developed. Finally, a traditional and robust optimisation of a butt welded joint has been performed by establishing a link between an optimisation software package and parametric finite element, the results of which show the ability of this approach to extract the robust optimal designs from the Pareto front...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of entrained sand {{in oil and}} gas production is becoming increasingly prevalent as wells age and this is leading to erosion-corrosion in C 02 -saturated conditions becoming a major mechanism of material attack. Its understanding, prediction and control are key challenges to sound facilities design. The use of carbon steel in conjunction with corrosion inhibitors in preventing erosioncorrosion has been observed as an economically viable solution for <b>oil</b> and gas <b>piping</b> systems. In order to produce highly effective corrosion inhibitors, {{it is important to understand}} how inhibitors act on each of the components of erosion-corrosion. Although research into corrosion inhibition has been extensively conducted, there is less documentation of inhibitors in retarding erosion-corrosion. This thesis has attempted to construct a quantitative structure relationship between erosion, corrosion and their synergistic effects to investigate erosion-corrosion and inhibition mechanisms with four fully formulated CO 2 inhibitors (CGO, CRO, CRW 8 and CRW 9) along with some mechanistic studies involving single components from inhibitor formulations. Two experimental set-ups were used: a rotating cylinder electrode (RCE) and a submerged impinging jet (SIJ). In both experimental methodologies, gravimetric measurement, cathodic polarisation, Linear Polarisation and AC impedance techniques were used to ascertain the extent of corrosion as a function of conditions and inhibitor dosing/type. Both RCE and SIJ test samples were studied using surface analysis techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), Light microscope, Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In this thesis, through integration of electrochemical analysis and gravimetric measurements the damage has been identified as being associated with mechanical erosion, electrochemical corrosion or interactive electrochemical/mechanical processes. The role that inhibitors can play in reducing damage in addition to that caused by corrosion, namely by erosion and their synergistic action has been shown. Under both configurations. erosion-corrosion interactions play a major role in damage with corrosion being a controlling parameter. The thesis has made substantial advances in the understanding of the extent to which corrosion inhibitors could be used to control erosion-corrosion damage and in understanding the mechanisms of how this can be achieved.
