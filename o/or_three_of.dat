5|$|By late March the Embassy {{began to}} reduce the number of US {{citizens}} in Vietnam by encouraging dependents and non-essential personnel to leave the country by commercial flights and on Military Airlift Command (MAC) C-141 and C-5 aircraft, which were still bringing in emergency military supplies. In late March, two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> these MAC aircraft were arriving each day and were used for the evacuation of civilians and Vietnamese orphans. On 4 April a C-5A aircraft carrying 250 Vietnamese orphans and their escorts suffered explosive decompression over the sea near Vung Tau and made a crash-landing while attempting to return to Tan Son Nhut; 153 people on board died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became {{the capital city of}} Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E

5|$|In counterattacks {{against the}} KPAF, the UN responded on July 15 with {{an attack on}} Kimpo, {{destroying}} two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the seven Yak-7s there and damaging the runway at the airfield. On July 18, Task Force 77 attacked Pyongyang and Pyongyang East Airfields, destroying 14 North Korean aircraft and damaging 13 more. The next day, Task Force 77 attacked Yonpo and destroyed 15 more North Korean aircraft there, and three more at Sondok. That day near Pyonggang F-80s of the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group destroyed another 14 North Korean fighters and one bomber, and damaging seven others. On July 20, another strike by 14 B-29s destroyed the runways at Pyongyang and Onjong-ni. In the process of these strikes, the UN aircraft also shot down six North Korean aircraft opposing the attacks. By {{the end of the}} day on July 20, only 65 of the KPAF 1st Air Division's original aircraft were intact, and only 34 of them were operable.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque {{style in}} Sicily was largely {{confined}} to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest {{examples of this}} style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By {{the middle of the}} 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably {{different from that of the}} mainland, it typically included at least two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterise in words.|$|E
5|$|The Early Middle Ages in Romania {{started with}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Roman troops and administration from Dacia province in the 270s. In the next millennium a series of peoples, most of whom only controlled two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the nearly ten historical regions that now form Romania, arrived. During this period, society and culture underwent fundamental changes. Town life came to an end in Dacia with the Roman withdrawal, and in Scythia Minorthe other Roman province in the territory of present-day Romania400 years later. Fine vessels made on fast potter's wheels disappeared and hand-made pottery became dominant from the 450s. Burial rites changed more than once from cremation to inhumation and vice versa until inhumation became dominant {{by the end of the}} 10thcentury.|$|E

5|$|The {{adventure}} {{is divided}} into 27 encounters across a 16-page module. Encounters are varied and each presents its own challenges. Encounter seven necessitates characters jumping from platform to platform above a sea of hot mud whilst evading erupting geysers; this in turn leads to encounter eight and a room of permanent darkness where a vampire guards Whelm. Encounter 17 occurs in a giant but fragile bubble located above a boiling lake, with the players needing to defeat a giant crab and retrieve Wave without damaging the bubble. Encounter 26 involves negotiating a magical ziggurat populated by various monsters (including sea lions, giant crayfish, giant scorpions, and manticores) before encounter 28, a battle against an ogre mage who possesses Blackrazor. A final challenge on departing is an encounter with two to four efreet if the characters have succeeded in taking two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the magical weapons.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradiška. The following day, two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines {{from the same}} squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of}} the 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. Even at this late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E
