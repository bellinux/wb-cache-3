He was asked what he would do {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E

50|$|In the lead-up to the invasion, the U.S. and U.K. {{emphasized}} {{the argument that}} Saddam Hussein was developing {{weapons of mass destruction}} and that he thus presented a threat to his neighbors and to the world community. Throughout late 2001, 2002, and early 2003, the Bush Administration worked to build a case for invading Iraq, culminating in then Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell's</b> February 2003 address to the Security Council.|$|R
50|$|This {{claim was}} {{repeated}} {{several times in}} the run-up to the war, including in then-Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell's</b> speech to the U.N Security Council on February 5, 2003, which concluded with a long recitation of the information provided by al-Libi. Powell's speech was made less than a month after a then-classified CIA report concluded that the information provided by al-Libi was unreliable, and about a year after a DIA report concluded the same thing.|$|R

25|$|He criticizes Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> for {{promoting}} the decision taken by President George H. W.

2500|$|Resolution 1441 {{was most}} {{prominent}} during the {{run up to}} the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell's</b> address to the Security Council one month before the invasion. According to an independent commission of inquiry {{set up by the}} government of the Netherlands, UN resolution 1441 [...] "cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council's resolutions." [...] Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the 2003 invasion violated international law.|$|R
25|$|The {{fact that}} no ricin had been found was known to some {{government}} departments very early on, but this information was not revealed to the public until after Bourgass's trial two years later, although in the interim it was cited as evidence for further terrorism laws, as well as featuring in US Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell's</b> 5 February 2003 speech to the UN to build {{the case for the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq, as part of the alleged Abu Musab al-Zarqawi global terrorist network.

He said that he had heard from three US {{intelligence}} sources that Diego Garcia was used as [...] "a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time" [...] and, [...] "What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment".|$|R

25|$|In return, {{the state}} promised {{to comply with}} an {{agreement}} with the International Atomic Energy Agency which supports better monitoring of its nuclear interests.

5000|$|Walter {{had been}} {{opposed to the}} Vietnam War, a source of {{contention}} with his father, but had not used his money to act on his convictions.

It was headlined [...] "Powell Lied?" [...] describing Powell's February 5, 2003 speech to the United Nations Security Council—the New York Times insisted on adding the question mark. Walter took out similar advertisements in English and Spanish in local newspapers in Santa Barbara, California, where he was living. His stance was unpopular; posters he attached to his house were torn down, and a rock was put through his car's window. Walter did not repeat the advertisement.|$|R
5000|$|An {{effort by}} the DOE to correct this detail in {{comments}} prepared for United <b>States</b> Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell's</b> UN appearance was rebuffed by the administration and Powell, in his address to the UN Security Council just before the war, referenced the aluminum tubes, stating that while experts disagreed {{on whether or not}} the tubes were destined for a centrifuge program, the specifications of the tubes were unusually tight. Powell later admitted he had presented {{what turned out to be}} an inaccurate case to the UN on Iraqi weapons, and the intelligence he was relying on was, in some cases, [...] "deliberately misleading." [...] After the 2008 U.S. presidential election, and the election of Democratic party nominee Barack Obama, President Bush stated that [...] "my biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq".|$|R

5000|$|Section VII of the Committee's report {{focuses on}} the {{intelligence}} behind Secretary <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell's</b> speech to the UN on February 5, 2003.

The report also describes the subsequent review made by <b>Colin</b> <b>Powell</b> and analysts from the State Department with analysts from the CIA. In the speech, Powell said that [...] "every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence." [...] Despite this, the Committee concluded that [...] "much of the information provided or cleared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for inclusion in Secretary Powell’s speech was overstated, misleading, or incorrect." ...|$|R
