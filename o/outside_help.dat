She {{is the only person}} to maintain correspondence with Berkman in prison, and defends him from criticism on the <b>outside,</b> <b>helping</b> him upon his release. The book tracks the development of Berkman's ideas on political violence, and his ruminations often read like a dialog with Goldman, whom he knows intimately.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, which was in effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from <b>outside</b> <b>help</b> before attacking it.|$|E
5|$|German East Africa, {{acquired}} by Germany during the 1880s, covered roughly , and by 1914 {{was home to}} about 5,000 white settlers, {{most of whom were}} of German origin. German East African soldiery at the outbreak of war comprised 216 German officers and enlisted men, and 2,450 askaris (native soldiers); police numbered 45 whites and 2,154 askaris. Because of the British Royal Navy's domination of the Indian Ocean, German East Africa was largely isolated from <b>outside</b> <b>help.</b> It therefore fought a war of improvisation, judicious resource management and unorthodox strategy. During the conflict, its military strength grew to a peak of 3,300 whites and anywhere between 15,000 and 30,000 askaris, all commanded by Generalmajor Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage <b>outside</b> <b>help</b> if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E
5|$|HMS Fife (a Royal Navy County Class Destroyer) {{was on its}} {{way back}} to the United Kingdom when the {{hurricane}} struck, and was turned back to provide emergency aid to the island. Sailing through mountainous seas The Fife docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only <b>outside</b> <b>help</b> for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called Humphrey) took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance. This was the first time a Royal Navy ship had provided a public broadcast news service.|$|E
5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated <b>outside</b> <b>help</b> to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 April, South Vietnamese forces {{reported}} hearing the sound of tanks moving toward {{the southern end of}} the district airfield. At about 5:30 am, the Viet Cong launched another attack from southern Lộc Ninh, with the support of about 25 T-54 and PT-76 tanks. Viet Cong infantry initially managed to breach the South Vietnamese lines, but the attack soon stalled, and neither side gained a clear advantage. In the afternoon, elements of the Viet Cong E6 Regiment forced their way through the compound gates, but air strikes from U.S. AC-130s stopped them from advancing any further. By that stage, however, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment had absorbed a significant number of casualties; it only had 50 soldiers left, while another 150 wounded were in the hospital bunker. The defenders in Lộc Ninh were cut off from <b>outside</b> <b>help</b> since heavy-calibre North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns effectively prevented resupply and medivac flights into the area.|$|E
5|$|The British {{bargaining}} position had worsened; the American scientists {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed <b>outside</b> <b>help,</b> {{and they wanted to}} prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to forgive}} is widely {{recognized}} by the public, but they are often {{at a loss for}} ways to accomplish it.

However, not even regular prayer was found to be effective.|$|E

When the amir and former slave Basasiri took up the Shia Fatimid banner in Baghdad in, the caliph al-Qa'im was unable to defeat him without <b>outside</b> <b>help.</b> Toghril Beg, the Seljuq sultan, restored Baghdad to Sunni rule and took Iraq for his dynasty.|$|E

The Dáirine were represented in historical times most clearly by the Corcu Loígde, over whom the Deirgtine finally achieved supremacy during the 7th century, following the loss by the former of their centuries-long hold on the Kingdom of Osraige, apparently with some <b>outside</b> <b>help</b> from the Uí Néill.|$|E

The study identified that people who like to stay in the outside space, such as the open space beneath the house and the garden, showed higher happiness.
