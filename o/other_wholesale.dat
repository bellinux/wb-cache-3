2500|$|While {{amate paper}} {{is one of}} a number of paper crafts of Mexico, along with papel picado, papier-mâché [...] (such as Judas figures, alebrijes or {{decorative}} items such as strands of chili peppers called ristras). However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes. The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional Mexican handcraft designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both Otomi artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers. [...] The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers. [...] Although the Nahua people of Guerrero remain the principle buyers of Otomi paper, <b>other</b> <b>wholesale</b> buyers [...] have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks, [...] furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and [...] more. [...] The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, standard quality and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of production intermittence on spot markets. We use both game theory and an adaptation of the Camerer and Ho (1999) behavioral model. Con-trolling for costs, we find that intermittent technologies yield lower prices when incumbents have individual market power, but higher {{when they do not}} have it. This happens when firms are risk-neutral and risk-averse, and also under different intermittence and ownership configurations. Replacing high-cost assets with low-cost ones results in higher prices than letting them co-exist. The findings have implications for, among <b>others,</b> <b>wholesale</b> electricity markets, in which wind power is increasingly important...|$|R
6000|$|So He spoke; {{and they}} did not fully {{understand}} what He meant. They thought that by their adversary He meant the Roman governor. For they immediately began to talk to Him about some Galileans whose blood Pilate, the Roman governor, had mingled with their sacrifices (I suppose in some of those wars which were continually breaking out in Judea). I think He meant more than that. [...] "Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans? Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." [...] As much as to say, though ye did not rebel against the Romans like these Galilaeans, you have your sins, which will ruin YOU. As long as you are hypocrites, with your mouths full of the cant of religion, and your hearts full of all mean and spiteful passions; as long as you cannot of yourselves discern what is right, and have lost conscience, and the everlasting distinction between right and wrong, so long are you walking blindfold to ruin. There is an adversary against you, who will surely deliver you to the judge some day, and then it will be too late to cry for mercy. And who was that adversary? Who but the everlasting law of God, which says, Thou shalt do justly?--and you Jews are utterly unjust, false, covetous, and unrighteous. Thou shalt love all men; and you are cruel and spiteful, hating each other, and making all mankind hate you. [...] Thou shalt walk humbly with thy God; and you Jews are walking proudly with God; fancying that God belongs only to you; that because you are His chosen people, He will let you commit every sin you choose, as long as you keep His name on your lips, and keep up an empty worship of Him in the temple. That is your adversary, the everlasting moral law of God. [...] And who is the Judge but God Himself, who is set on His throne judging right, while you are doing wrong? And who is the officer, to whom that judge will deliver you? There indeed the Jews were right. It was the Romans whom God appointed to punish them for their sins. All which our Lord had foretold, as all the world knows, came true forty years after in that horrible siege of Jerusalem, which the Jews brought on themselves entirely by their own folly, and pride, and wicked lawlessness. In that siege, by famine and pestilence, by the Romans' swords, by crucifixion, and by each other's hands (for the different factions were murdering each <b>other</b> <b>wholesale</b> up to the very day Jerusalem was taken), thousands of Jews perished horribly, and the rest were sold as slaves over the face of the whole earth, and led away into a captivity from which they could not escape till they had paid the uttermost farthing.|$|E

40|$|Cross-brand {{pass-through}} {{implies that}} a retailer responds to wholesale promotional {{support from a}} target brand by changing the retail prices of competitive brands. Besanko et al. (2005) model a target brand's retail price {{as a function of}} its own and <b>other</b> brands' <b>wholesale</b> prices using 780 observations (15 price zones × 52 weeks) and take the many significant coefficients for <b>other</b> brands' <b>wholesale</b> prices that they find as evidence of cross-brand pass-through. Because price zones do not react independently to wholesale prices when they set a brand's retail price, Besanko et al. 's (2005) estimation overstates the number of independent observations by a factor of 15. When we correct for this overstatement of independent observations, we find that the number of stable, significant coefficients for <b>other</b> brands' <b>wholesale</b> prices is lower than one would expect by chance. We conclude that {{there is no evidence of}} cross-brand pass-through in the 11 categories analyzed by Besanko et al. (2005). pricing, promotion, retailing and wholesaling, channels of distribution, econometric models, Dominick's, packaged goods, laundry detergent, price zones...|$|R
