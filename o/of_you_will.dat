[...] Despite mentoring {{some of the best}} engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. [...] He once told a new intake class: [...] "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated.

The remaining 10% <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort". [...] Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming [...] "cramped by premature specialisation".|$|E

[...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas.
