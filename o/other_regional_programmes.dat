25|$|The BBC {{has never}} made as many <b>regional</b> <b>programmes</b> as {{commercial}} {{television in the}} South West.

50|$|ITV London itself doesn't {{make any}} programmes, as all {{productions}} were completed by external companies, Carlton, LWT or London News Network. The News and Sport {{for the region}} continued to be provided by LNN until 1 March 2004, when ITN took over production of London Tonight, resulting in the move of the programme from The London Studios to ITN's headquarters at Gray's Inn Road. <b>Other</b> <b>regional</b> <b>programmes</b> continued to be produced for the region by the two legal franchises, Carlton and LWT, and the companies were accredited {{at the end of}} the production until 2004, when it was replaced by a ITV London caption for both companies following the ITV plc merger.|$|E
40|$|The English Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) were {{established}} in April 1999 {{as part of the}} wider package of devolution measures. One of the first tasks undertaken by the RDAs was the preparation of Regional Economic Strategies (RESs). These strategies were intended to be a means of securing agreement on a single <b>regional</b> vision and <b>programme</b> of development. However, the RDAs are not the only actors present in the English regions and the RESs are not the only regional-level planning exercises. This paper reviews the guidance given to RDAs regarding the preparation and content of RESs. It also provides an initial assessment of the strategy documents {{and the extent to which}} they are coordinated with <b>other</b> <b>regional</b> plans and <b>programmes.</b> The eight RESs differ in terms of their structure, content and emphasis. In general terms, and accepting the constraints under which they were prepared, it is clear that they represent positive attempts to develop strategies for the regions. Key issues for the future include the need for RDAs to agree detailed subject-specific action plans, to establish stronger links with <b>other</b> <b>regional</b> actors and to ensure that they add value to regional development. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{programme}} {{was first}} produced from All Souls' Church in Blackman Lane, Leeds, where {{part of the}} church had {{been converted into a}} black-and-white television studio with attendant equipment. In 1974, Look North moved to new studios at Broadcasting House on Woodhouse Lane, near Leeds Metropolitan University and round the corner from All Souls Church. The new facilities, equipped for colour, remained the base for Look North Leeds and <b>other</b> <b>regional</b> <b>programmes</b> until 26 September 2004. A brand new broadcasting centre was built near the West Yorkshire Playhouse on St Peter's Square, with BBC Look North moving into the new premises on 27 September 2004. The move coincided with the introduction of a new BBC Yorkshire region.|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to a central drive for evidence-based practice, {{there have been many}} research support schemes, setups, and other practices concentrating on facilitating access to external research, such as the Centre for Evidence Based Healthcare Aotearoa, the Cochrane Collaboration, and the York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Very little {{attention has been paid to}} supporting internal research in terms of local evidence and internal research capabilities. The whole evidence-based practice movement has alienated internal decision makers and, thus, very little progress has been made in the context of evidence informing local policy formation. Health and social policies are made centrally based on dubious claims and often evidence is sought after implementation. For example, on record, most health care practitioners appear to agree with the causal link between depression and mental illness (sometimes qualified with other social factors) with suicide; off the record, even some psychiatrists doubt that such a link is applicable to the population as a whole. Therefore, be it through misplaced loyalty or a lack of support for internal researchers/decision makers, local evidence informing local decision making may have been ignored in favour of external evidence. In this paper, we present a practical holistic model to support local evidence-based decision making. This approach is more relevant in light of a new approach to primary health care of “local knowledge” complementing external evidence. One possible outcome would be to network with <b>other</b> <b>regional</b> <b>programmes</b> around the world to share information and identify “best” practices, such as the “Stop Youth Suicide Campaign”(www. stopyouthsuicide. com) ...|$|E
