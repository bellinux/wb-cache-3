40|$|Atmospheric {{sphericity}} is {{an important}} factor that must be considered in order to evaluate an accurate ozone loss rate in the polar stratosphere. The built-in plane-parallel radiative transfer scheme of a nudging chemical transport model (CTM) and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with coupled chemistry is modified by a pseudospherical approximation. The plane-parallel atmosphere radiative transfer version (PPA version) is compared with the pseudospherical atmosphere radiative transfer version (SA version) for both the nudging CTM and AGCM. The nudging CTM can isolate the chemical effects for a given dynamical field, while the interaction among the chemical, radiative, and dynamical processes can be studied with the AGCM. The present analysis focuses on Antarctica during an ozone hole period. In the ozone loss period over Antarctica, ozone starts to decrease earlier and minimum value of total ozone becomes lower in the SA versions of both the nudging CTM and the AGCM than in the corresponding PPA versions. The ozone mixing ratio decreases earlier in the SA version because of an earlier increase of ClO concentration initiated by the upward actinic flux at solar zenith angles greater than 90 °. Dynamics plays an important role as well as the chemical processes. During the <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>period,</b> the ozone distribution becomes almost the same in the SA and PPA versions of the nudging CTM, while in the AGCM the ozone amount in the SA version remains at lower values compared to those of the PPA version. In the AGCM, a decrease of ozone over Antarctica enhances the latitudinal gradient of temperature and thus strengthens the polar vortex in the SA version. A resultant delay of the polar vortex breakup causes the delay of the ozone recovery. For the AGCM, ensemble runs are performed. The ensemble experiment exhibits large ozone variances after the middle of December, when the ozone recovery is dynamically controlled. Most ensemble members of the AGCM show a delay of the polar vortex breakup in the SA version, while a few members show opposite results. In the latter members, the polar vortex breakup is strongly affected by the enhanced EP flux from the troposphere around 100 hPa, which causes the variances in the <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>period.</b> Most members, however, do not show large statistical variances; that justifies the conclusions from the ensemble means...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> on Antarctic sea ice in the next half-century, by comparing two ensembles of integrations of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, from 2001 to 2065.

In this study, we examine the implications of stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> for the tropospheric chemistry and ozone air quality with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). With a full recovery of the stratospheric ozone, the projected increases in ozone column range from 1 % over the low latitudes to more than 10 % over the polar regions. The sensitivity factor of troposphere ozone photolysis rate, defined as the percentage changes in surface ozone photolysis rate for 1 % increase in stratospheric ozone column, shows significant seasonal variation but is always negative with absolute value larger than one. The expected stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> is found to affect the tropospheric ozone destruction rates much more than the ozone production rates. Significant decreases in surface ozone photolysis rates due to stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> are simulated. The global average tropospheric OH decreases by 1. 7 %, and the global average lifetime of tropospheric ozone increases by 1. 5 %. The perturbations to tropospheric ozone and surface ozone show large seasonal and spatial variations.

Furthermore, this enhanced warming would be strongest in the Northern Hemisphere, which is surprising since previous studies have consistently shown the effects of stratospheric ozone changes to be most pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere. Hu et al. (2011) base their claims largely on differences in the simulated temperature change between two groups of CMIP 3 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3) climate models, one group which included stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> in its twenty-first century simulations and a second group which did not. Both groups of models were forced with the same increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases according to the A 1 B emissions scenario.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} Northern Hemisphere polar <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> to a scenario {{in which there is}} rapid loss of Arctic summer sea ice {{in the first half of}} the 21 st century. The issue is addressed by coupling a chemistry climate model to an ocean general circulation model and performing simulations of <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> with, and without, an external perturbation designed to cause a rapid and complete loss of summertime Arctic sea ice. Under this extreme perturbation, the stratospheric response takes the form of a springtime polar cooling which is dynamical rather than radiative in origin, and is caused by reduced wave forcing from the troposphere. The response lags the onset of the sea-ice perturbation by about one decade and lasts for more than two decades, and is associated with an enhanced weakening of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. The stratospheric dynamical response leads to a 10 DU reduction in polar column ozone, which is statistically robust. While this represents a modest loss, it has the potential to induce a delay of roughly one decade in Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> estimates made in the 2006 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion...|$|R
40|$|The role of stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> in the Southern Hemisphere climate system, in {{the coming}} decades, is {{examined}} by contrasting two 10 -member ensembles of Community Atmospheric Model (CAM 3) integrations, over the period 2000 – 2060. Model integrations in the first ensemble are conducted with {{a complete set of}} forcings: greenhouse gas concentrations from the A 1 B scenario, SSTs from corresponding ocean-atmosphere coupled model integrations, and ozone starting with severe depletion over the South Pole and recovering by mid-century. The integrations in the second ensemble are very similar to the first, except that only the transient ozone forcing is specified, and all other forcings are kept at year 2000 levels. Specifying <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> in isolation allows us to determine unambiguously how it impacts the atmospheric circulation. We find that, in DJF, most key indices of atmospheric circulation show significant trends in the second ensemble, due to the closing of the ozone hole. In the first ensemble, however, trends are found to be statistically insignificant for nearly all key circulation indices. This suggests that <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> will result in a nearly complete cancellation (and possible reversal) of the atmospheric circulation effects associated with increasing greenhouse gases, in Southern Hemisphere summer, over the coming half century...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the tropopause in the past, present, and future climate is examined by analyzing a set of long-term integrations with stratosphere-resolving chemistry climate models (CCMs). These CCMs have high vertical resolution near the tropopause, a model top located in the mesosphere or above, and, most important, fully interactive stratospheric chemistry. Using such CCM integrations, {{it is found that}} the tro-popause pressure (height) will continue to decrease (increase) in the future, but with a trend weaker than that in the recent past. The reduction in the future tropopause trend is shown to be directly associated with stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery.</b> A significant <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> occurs in the Southern Hemisphere lower stratosphere of the CCMs, and this leads to a relative warming there that reduces the tropopause trend in the twenty-first century. The future tropopause trends predicted by the CCMs are considerably smaller than those predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) models, especially in the southern high latitudes.

At such latitudes the uncertainties of total ozone trends are greater than those obtained from AR(1) models and the expected time required to detect <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> correspondingly longer. We find no evidence of LRC behavior in southern middle-and high-subpolar latitudes (45 °– 60 °S), where the long-term ozone decline attributable to anthropogenic chlorine is the greatest.

In northern middle and high latitudes, on the other hand, there is clear evidence of LRC behavior. This increases the uncertainties on the long-term trend attributable to anthropogenic chlorine by about a factor of 1. 5 and lengthens the expected time to detect <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> by a similar amount (from ∼ 2030 to ∼ 2045). If the long-term changes in ozone are instead fit by a piecewise-linear trend rather than by stratospheric chlorine loading, then the strong decrease of northern middle- and high-latitude ozone during the first half of the 1990 s and its subsequent increase in the second half of the 1990 s projects more strongly on the trend and makes a smaller contribution to the noise. This both increases the trend and weakens the LRC behavior at these latitudes, to the extent that <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> (according to this model, and in the sense of a statistically significant ozone increase) is already on the verge of being detected.

In the winter northern polar lower stratosphere the increased radiative cooling from the growing abundance of GHGs is, in most models, balanced by adiabatic warming from stronger polar downwelling. In the Antarctic lower stratosphere the models simulate an increase in low temperature extremes required for polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation, but the positive trend is decreasing over the twenty-first century in all models. In the Arctic, none of the models simulates a statistically significant increase in Arctic PSCs throughout the twenty-first century. The subtropical jets accelerate in response to climate change and the <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> produces a westward acceleration of the lower-stratospheric wind over the Antarctic during summer, though this response is sensitive to the rate of recovery projected by the models.

In the midlatitude lower stratosphere the evolution differs from that in the tropics, and rather than a steady decrease in ozone, first a decrease in ozone is simulated from 1960 to 2000, which is then followed by a steady increase through the 21 st century. Ozone in the midlatitude lower stratosphere returns to 1980 levels by ~ 2045 in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and by ~ 2055 in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and full <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> is likely reached by 2100 in both hemispheres. Overall, in all regions except the tropical lower stratosphere, full <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> from ODSs occurs significantly later than the return of total column ozone to its 1980 level. The latest return of total column ozone is projected to occur over Antarctica (~ 2045 – 2060) whereas it is not likely that full <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> is reached {{by the end of the}} 21 st century in this region. Arctic total column ozone is projected to return to 1980 levels well before polar stratospheric halogen loading does so (~ 2025 – 2030 for total column ozone, cf. 2050 – 2070 for Cl y + 60 ×Br y) and it is likely that full recovery of total column ozone from the effects of ODSs has occurred by ~ 2035. In contrast to the Antarctic, by 2100 Arctic total column ozone is projected to be above 1960 levels, but not in the fixed GHG simulation, indicating that climate change plays a significant role...|$|R

40|$|Verification of a stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> {{remains a}} high {{priority}} for environmental research and policy definition. Models predict an <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> at a much lower rate than the measured depletion rate observed to date. Therefore improved precision of the satellite and ground ozone observing systems are required over the long term to verify its recovery. We show that validation of satellite radiances from space and from the ground can be a very effective means for correcting long term drifts of backscatter type satellite measurements and can be used to cross calibrate all B W instruments in orbit (TOMS, SBW/ 2, GOME, SCIAMACHY, OM, GOME- 2, OMPS). This method bypasses the retrieval algorithms used for both satellite and ground based measurements that are normally used to validate and correct the satellite data. Radiance comparisons employ forward models and are inherently more accurate than inverse (retrieval) algorithms. This approach however requires well calibrated instruments and an accurate radiative transfer model that accounts for aerosols. TOMS and SCIAMACHY calibrations are checked to demonstrate this method and to demonstrate applicability for long term trends...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{recent years}} {{a number of}} chemistry-climate models have been {{developed}} {{with an emphasis on}} the stratosphere. Such models cover a wide range of time scales of integration and vary considerably in complexity. The results of specific diagnostics are here analysed to examine the differences amongst individual models and observations, to assess the consistency of model predictions, with a particular focus on polar ozone. For example, many models indicate a significant cold bias in high latitudes, the "cold pole problem", particularly in the southern hemisphere during winter and spring. This is related to wave propagation from the troposphere which can be improved by improving model horizontal resolution and with the use of non-orographic gravity wave drag. As a result of the widely differing modelled polar temperatures, different amounts of polar stratospheric clouds are simulated which in turn result in varying ozone values in the models. The results are also compared to determine the possible future behaviour of ozone, with an emphasis on the polar regions and mid-latitudes. All models predict eventual <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery,</b> but give a range of results concerning its timing and extent. Differences in the simulation of gravity waves and planetary waves as well as model resolution are likely major sources of uncertainty for this issue. In the Antarctic, the ozone hole has probably reached almost its deepest although the vertical and horizontal extent of depletion may increase slightly further over the next few years. According to the model results, Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> could begin any year within the range 2001 to 2008. The limited number of models which have been integrated sufficiently far indicate that full <b>recovery</b> of <b>ozone</b> to 1980 levels may not occur in the Antarctic until about the year 2050. For the Arctic, most models indicate that small ozone losses may continue for a few more years and that recovery could begin any year within the range 2004 to 2019. The start of <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> in the Arctic is therefore expected to appear later than in the Antarctic. Further, interannual variability will tend to mask the signal for longer than in the Antarctic, delaying still further the date at which <b>ozone</b> <b>recovery</b> may be said to have started. Because of this inherent variability of the system, the decadal evolution of Arctic ozone will not necessarily be a direct response to external forcing...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{measure the}} impact of {{different}} <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during classical resistance training (RT) modalities Background. Resistance training was introduced into rehabilitation programs to improve the efficiency of traditional training. The impact of different RT modalities on muscular performance is well known but the <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> between successive RT sets recommended in the literature varied between 30 s and 5 min. Method. Twenty one healthy subjects were tested while performing a classical RT paradigm: 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 75 % of 1 -RM, with <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> of 30, 60, 90 and 120 s. Results. A <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 30 or 60 s did not allow a return of SBP and HR to resting values. A progressive drift of the values was observed in the successive rests {{as well as in}} the successive efforts. A <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> longer than 60 s (90 and 120 s) allowed a return of SBP and HR to resting values. Conclusions. A <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 90 s or more between successive classical RT sets is recommended in order to avoid excessive SBP and HR elevation. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.
