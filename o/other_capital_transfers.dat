Payments related to incentives were 0 only in 4.3 % of the LLM-year observations (concentrated in 2008, where they represented the 24.3 %), with an additional 3.2 % smaller than one euro per-capita. Payments for infrastructures were 0 in 6.9 % of the cases, while they were negative (due to reimbursements relative to projects that had been stopped) only for 1.1 % of the observations. An additional 9.9 % were smaller than one euro per-capita. In all these cases we impose the log to be equal to zero. We ignore the last category (other expenditures) because it amounted to 2.8 % of total cumulative payments in 2013, with the majority of LLM-year observations equal to 0.|$|E

40|$|How does an {{oil boom}} affect the forest cover of {{tropical}} oil exporting-countries? Are they {{more or less}} likely than non-oil countries to experience forest loss? What macro-economic linkages and policies are decisive? This article summarises research on land-use changes in eight tropical developing countries. Our country-comparative approach reveals that the direct oil impacts on forests are unquestionably subordinate compared to oil's derived macroeconomic impact. In most cases, oil wealth indirectly but significantly comes to protect tropical forests. The core mechanism here is that oil rents cause 'Dutch Disease', decreasing the price-competitiveness of agriculture and logging, which strongly diminishes pressures for deforestation and forest degradation. But domestic policy responses to oil wealth are also vital determinants for the forest outcome. When governments use most oil wealth for urban spending sprees, this reinforces the core effect by pulling more labor out of land-using and forest-degrading activities. Yet, in extreme cases when boosting oil revenues finance large road-construction programs or frontier-colonization projects, the core forest-protective effect of oil wealth can be reversed. Repeated currency devaluation and import protection of heavily land-using domestic sectors also contribute to increased forest pressures. These conclusions have ample policy implications, reaching beyond the group of tropical oil countries. <b>Other</b> international <b>capital</b> <b>transfers,</b> like bilateral credits, aid or debt relief can have similar impacts. These measures will alleviate pressures on forests, unless they come to bolster specific forest-detrimental policies. This also provides some suggestions on what forest-friendly safeguards could realistically be taken {{in the design of}} structural adjustment programs, considering the important trade-offs between development and conservation objectives...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the desirability of implementing of a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax in South Africa. The implementation of a <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax system in South Africa should generate additional income without placing a further administrative or financial burden on the South African Revenue Services. A system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax will replace the current system of donation tax and estate duty in South Africa. Any new system will be based on the principles established by these two forms of taxation, but should simultaneously address many of the loopholes in these two systems. Since the Margo Commission's recommendation in 1986 that South Africa should implement a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax, much has been written about this form of capital tax but the government has never implemented the recommendations. However, it is certain that a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax will be implemented in South Africa in the future. The current system of donation tax and estate duty is not effective in levying the taxes and earning the income for the government for which it was originally designed. Over the years numerous ways have been developed to legally avoid these taxes, which is why they are referred to as voluntary taxes (Anon, 1988 : 17). This dissertation consists of three parts: The first part is a literature study in which capital taxes are discussed. The distinction between income and capital is reviewed. The various forms of capital taxes are identified and the arguments for and against introducing one of them are discussed. This part concludes with arguments for and against a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax for South Africa. The second part is an analysis of donation tax and estate duty as currently levied in South Africa. The shortcomings of the current legislation are discussed and legal ways to avoid estate duty are identified. The inheritance tax system in the UK and the donation tax and estate duty system in the USA are also briefly discussed. The anti-avoidance measures implemented in these countries are discussed in some detail in view of recommendations to implement similar measures in South Africa. In the third part a <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> tax system for South Africa is proposed. Precautions to minimise the avoidance of these taxes through interest-free loans and generation-skipping devises are discussed. Finally a conclusion is reached regarding the matters analysed in this dissertation...|$|R

For this reason, a number of studies including Puri and Ritzema (1999), Chami, Fullenkamp, and Jahjah (2003), and Bouhga-Hagbe (2004) focus on the determinants of remittances. This dissertation models remittances as a transfer within a “multi-national ” family for which remittances may be either be saved, used to finance investment in housing or schooling for example or simply consumed. The model provides several hypotheses regarding how remittances might affect household spending and investment decisions in the home country. In particular, we use the estimation framework of Gruben and McLeod (1998), Bosworth and Collins (1999), Mody and Murshid (2002) and especially Bouhga-Hagbe (2004) to study the impact of remittances on savings, investment and growth rates in a panel of 62 developing countries for which long remittances series are available and compose either over 5 % of exports or imports or over 2 % of GDP. Where remittances are large relative to exports, they may also affect the real exchange rate and the trade balance. Where remittances are large with respect to imports, they finance a trade balance deficit. Finally, we can regress income by deciles and quintiles on remittances to investigate which household groups appear to benefit most from remittances compared to other sources of foreign exchange, including exports, aid grants and <b>other</b> <b>capital</b> inflows and <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

Three major research questions were derived to examine public school fiscal management relative to budgeting efficiency, lapsing and depletion funds. The three research questions are as follows: (1) What variables can identify and are likely to maximally contribute to school districts' budget expenditures falling within a plus/minus 2 % range of the adopted budget? (2) What factors would be maximally associated with school districts having either a credit or deficit ending fund balance in the general operations budget? (3) What variables are likely to maximally contribute to school districts budgeting practices leading to increased or decreased capital levy fund balance? A systematic stratified sample of 31 school districts constituted the study group. Discriminant Function Analysis was used in the statistical treatment of 11 discriminant variables for six budget classifications. Each hypothesis was rejected at the. 01 level of significance. <b>Capital</b> <b>Transfer</b> Funds indicated maximum contribution in differentiating school budget groups which were within the plus/minus 2 % range of the adopted budget. For the second research question and hypothesis, Revenue, in linear-combination with Beginning Fund Balance and expenditure, evidenced maximum ability to differentiate the credit fund balance. <b>Capital</b> <b>Transfer</b> Funds added minimal ability to discriminate budget groups.

Large foreign <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> permit over-valued ex-change rates to develop or continue, and these penalize agriculture by reducing the incentives to export and by increasing the incen-tives to import. Results indicate that an increasing ratio of foreign debt to GNP is associated with an increasing ratio of agri-cultural imports to GNP and a decreasing ratio of agricultural exports to GNP. It is concluded that further borrowing by debt-burdened countries is unlikely to solve their basic problems unless accompanied by the appropriate economic policy changes necessary for long-term economic growth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the pattern of decolonisation in West Africa was a {{function}} of the nature of human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> from the colonisers to the indigenous elites of the former colonies. Underpinning the nature of these human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> is the colonial educational ideology. Where this ideology emphasized the notion of "assimilation", the system generally tended to produce elites that depended highly on the coloniser for their livelihood, hence necessitating a continuation of the imperial relationship even after independence was granted. On the contrary, where the ideology emphasized the "strengthening of the solid elements" of the country-side, the system tended to produce a bunch of elites that were quite independent of the coloniser and consequently had little to lose from a disruption of the imperial relationship at independence. The model raises several predictions based on a single assumption {{on the nature of the}} nationalist elite. The paper's contribution, is in providing a framework for understanding the different paths of decolonisation in Africa in general, but more specifically in the British and French West African empires, an approach which unites both the Eurocentric and Afrocentric perspectives.

Any child receives two transfers, one as a non-human transfer and the other as a human <b>capital</b> <b>transfer.</b> Under different education regimes, non-human transfers offset the low realization of innate ability, which despite the human <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> implies a low level of earnings. Then the questions that will arise are, first, to what extent skill-compensating investments are important as ex-ante income inequality reduction mechanisms in the private provision system, and secondly, how public education can affect this reduction mechanism. I show that tax policy may have unexpected effects on the compensatory effect, that is, on the income gap. The result is that the distribution of income induced by the public provision system is not more equally distributed. Moreover, the fraction of population that does not improve is just {{at the bottom of the}} income distribution. I also explore some possibilities to avoid this negative effect and preserve public education as an essential public service.
