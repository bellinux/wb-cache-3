5|$|Jesuit {{settlers}} from England {{founded the}} Province of Maryland in 1634. However, the 1646 {{defeat of the}} Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including missionary Andrew White, and the destruction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>school</b> at Calverton Manor. During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until {{after the end of}} the American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} the setting of Mr Perrin and Mr Traill – a second-rate public school – was clearly drawn from life, as indeed it was. The boys of Epsom College were delighted with the thinly disguised version <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>school,</b> but the college authorities were not, and Walpole was persona non grata at Epsom for many years. This was of no practical consequence, as {{he had no intention}} of returning to the teaching profession, but it was an early illustration of his capacity, noted by Benson, for unthinkingly giving offence, though being hypersensitive to criticism himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{change of}} {{perspective}} from concrete to abstract groups makes it natural to consider properties of {{groups that are}} independent of a particular realization, or in modern language, invariant under isomorphism, {{as well as the}} classes of group with a given such property: finite groups, periodic groups, simple groups, solvable groups, and so on. Rather than exploring properties of an individual group, one seeks to establish results that apply to a whole class of groups. The new paradigm was of paramount importance for the development of mathematics: it foreshadowed the creation of abstract algebra in the works of Hilbert, Emil Artin, Emmy Noether, and mathematicians <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E

The band was conceived by would-be Glasgow scene-maker Alan Cairnduff, although he left the job of organising the band to his friend John Milarky. At Cairnduff’s suggestion, Milarky teamed up with two musicians he had never worked with before – budding singer and lyricist Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill. Kerr and Burchill {{had known each other}} since the age of eight.

In the San Francisco area there are three schools that offer the technique as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>school</b> program, funded primarily by the David Lynch Foundation. The Visitacion Valley Middle School began the program in 2007 and the Everett Middle School and John O’Connell High School began the program sometime after that.

40|$|The {{responsibilities}} of principals as leaders <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> and as lead-ers of curriculum are inseparable. Both functions are subsets {{of the broader}} responsibility to be an educa-tional leader. During the 1980 s, principals were proclaimed to be the undisputed educational leaders <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools.</b> Considerable discussion ensued in the literature over whether this leader-ship was derived more from an individual’s expertise or from managerial skills. Others sought to distinguish school leader-ship from instructional leadership, institutional leadership from instructional leadership, and management from instruc-tional leadership, viewing each as important but separate functions...|$|R
