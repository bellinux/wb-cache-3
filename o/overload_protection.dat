The causes of cascading phenomena can be extremely complicated due to the many different and interactive mechanisms such as transmission <b>overloads,</b> <b>protection</b> equipment failures, transient instability, voltage collapse, etc. In the literature a number of vulnerability measures to cascading failures have been proposed to identify the most critical components in the grid and evaluate the damages caused by the removal of such recognized compo-nents from the grid.

40|$|The {{power system}} in many {{countries}} around world has been shifting from a regulated system to a deregulated and uncertain, competitive market environment. This exerts unprecedented and severe pressures on the existing transmission system by worsening flow congestion and decreasing security margins. On the other hand, maintaining system reliability is still {{the basis for the}} proper planning and operation of the bulk electric power system. The traditional deterministic security assessment approaches tend to be conservative by emphasizing the most severe, credible event. With the increased competition, engineers face more pressure, from economic imperatives in the market places, to operate the system closer to or even beyond the traditional deterministic limits. Therefore, more refined methods are needed to provide improved security assessment results, which should be able {{to take into account the}} probabilistic nature of many uncertain variables in the decision-making environment. Motivated by this need of the industry, this research is aimed at developing quantitative risk based methodologies for system security assessment with the consideration of the probabilistic nature of electric bulk system behavior. The work includes five parts: impact assessment for risk based security assessment, risk assessment for transformer overload, risk assessment for special protection systems, risk assessment for bilateral transactions, and risk based optimal power flow. Impact assessment for risk based security assessment provides a method to measure the cost consequence of different insecurity problems in the power system. Risk assessment for transformer <b>overload,</b> special <b>protection</b> systems and bilateral. transactions provide quantitative risk measurement which is helpful for the system operator to monitor the system security condition.

40|$|ITH 33 /IQM 9. 21 {{is a novel}} {{compound}} {{belonging to}} a family of glutamic acid derivatives, synthesized under the hypothesis implying that multitarget ligands may provide more efficient neuroprotection than single-targeted compounds. In rat hippocampal slices, oxygen plus glucose deprivation followed by re-oxygenation (OGD/Reox) elicited 42 % cell death. At 1 μM, ITH 33 /IQM 9. 21 mitigated this damage by 26 % and by 55 % at 3 μM. OGD/Reox also elicited mitochondrial depolarization, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and reduction of GSH levels. These changes were almost fully prevented when 3 μM ITH 33 /IQM 9. 21 was present during slice treatment with OGD/Reox. In isolated hippocampal neurons, ITH 33 /IQM 9. 21 reduced [Ca 2 +]c transients induced by a high K+ depolarizing solution or glutamate. In a photothrombotic model of stroke in mice, intraperitoneal injection of ITH 33 /IQM 9. 21 at 1. 25 mg/kg, 2. 5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg given before and during 2 days after stroke induction, reduced infarct volume by over 45 %. Furthermore, when the compound was administered 1 h post-stroke, a similar effect was observed.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} propionyl-L-carnitine protects rabbit heart against the {{deterioration}} caused by ischemia and reperfusion, isolated hearts were infused with a medium containing it in different concentrations. During control, normoxic perfusion, and 60 minutes of low-flow ischemia (37 degrees C) followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, diastolic, and developed pressures were monitored; coronary effluent was collected and assayed for lactate and creatine phosphokinase (CPK); mitochondria were harvested and assayed for oxidative phosphorylation and calcium content; and tissues for concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate. Propionyl-L-carnitine reduced the ischemic deterioration of mitochondrial function and {{the depletion of}} tissue stores of ATP. On reperfusion, hearts treated with it recovered better than the untreated hearts with respect to left ventricular performance, replenishment of ATP and CP stores, and mitochondrial function. The reperfusion-induced mitochondrial calcium overload and release of CPK were also reduced. The effect of propionyl-L-carnitine was dose dependent. At 10 (- 8) M it failed to modify ischemic and reperfusion damage but protected well at 10 (- 7) M. No further protection was obtained at 10 (- 6) M.

40|$|There is {{currently}} {{great interest in}} the technological properties of conductive polymer composites because their cost-performance balance. They have {{a wide range of}} industrial applications -in anti-static materials, self regulating heaters, current <b>overload</b> and overheating <b>protection</b> devices, and materials for electromagnetic radiation shielding. Measurements of the electrical properties of polymer composites {{are one of the most}} convenient and sensitive methods for studying polymer structure. A polymer composite differs substantially from a free polymer in a wide range of properties. The presence of filler affects both the electrical, as well as mechanical properties. One of the most important characteristics of conductive polymer composites is that their electrical conductivity increases nonlinearly with the increase of the concentration of filler particles. When the concentration of filler particles reaches a certain critical value, a drastic transition from an electrical insulator to a conductor is exhibited. This conductivity behavior resulting in a sudden insulator-conductor transition is ascribed to a percolation process, and the critical filler concentration at which the conductivity jump occurs is called ‘percolation threshold’. In the past few years, a lot of studies have been carried out to analyze the percolation phenomenon and mechanisms of the conductive behavior in conductive polymer composites. It has been established that the electrical conductivity of conductive polymer composites uncommonly depends on the temperature. Some of such composites show a sharp increase and/or decrease in electrical conductivity at specific temperatures. The conductive temperature coefficient (CTC) of conductive polymer composites has been widely investigated. In these work we investigated how concentration of the CB affects the dielectrical properties of the composite LDPE+CB. The ac electrical conductivity, σac, for such composites was measured.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM) project {{seeks to}} harness the energy {{generated}} by people using exercise machines and deliver this energy to the electric grid [1]. The implementation consists of a protection system, DC-DC converter, and an inverter. This project involves redesigning the existing DC-DC input protection circuit and current limiter for the EHFEM project [2]. The DC-DC converter takes in the power from the exercise machines and converts it to a manageable voltage level for the inverter. Due to a problem where the inverter may overload the converter, a current limiter sets to limit the current between the two circuits [4]. The inverter demanding more current at a lower voltage than the DC-DC converter can provide causes this <b>overload.</b> The input <b>protection</b> circuit for the DC-DC converter presents another major component of the protection system. The DC-DC converter must operate within set input voltage and current parameters. Concurrent with this project, students Byung Yoo and Sheldon Chu have developed a new DC-DC converter design with an operational range of 6 V to 51 V [7]. This paper proposes a design for an overvoltage protection circuit to limit the input of Yoo’s and Chu’s DC-DC converter to within its operational range. The input protection circuit regulates the incoming voltage from the elliptical machine and filters out any high frequency transient responses with capacitive filtering to generate a smooth DC signal. The circuit also functions to divert excess voltage and current that accumulates during the Enphase Micro-inverter’s startup period where an open load appears across the DC-DC converter leading to an overvoltage level [3]. A current sense circuit ensures the output from the DC-DC converter to the inverter delivers only as much power as the inverter can convert [4]. The device maintains a minimal component count number and lacks any excessively large components permitting easy assembly and installation. The device operates with a minimal loss of energy and minimizes fabrication costs allowing for recuperation of initial production costs over 10 years of normal use...|$|R
