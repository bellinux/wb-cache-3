5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for <b>off-gassing</b> is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In smelters, {{metal ores}} or {{concentrates}} are smelted to reduce a metal oxide to a metal {{through a series}} of reactions and processes. In a smelting process, a large amount of <b>off-gas</b> emissions are often generated, which can cause serious environmental and plant hygiene problems if not properly treated. <b>Off-gas</b> systems extract and treat the <b>off-gas</b> emissions, and ensure that the smelter operation is in accordance with environmental and industrial hygiene regulations. In this paper, the dynamic models for an industrial smelter furnace and converter <b>off-gas</b> system, tackling hazardous sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), are developed using mass continuity, momentum and energy conservation laws. Based on the developed dynamic models, the effects of important variables on the system’s dynamics are studied via simulations. The developed dynamic models provide a necessary basis for high performance control development of smelter <b>off-gas</b> systems because online measurements are limited and additional ones must be justified.
