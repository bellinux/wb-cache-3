5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the antislavery Republican Party became the {{dominant}} political organization in Massachusetts, led by Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson who espoused Garrison's views in Congress and further increased sectionalism. In 1856, Sumner delivered a speech <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> so scathing and insulting to pro-slavery politicians that Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina severely beat {{him with a}} cane. By 1860, the Republicans controlled the Governor's office, the state legislature and the mayoralty of Boston.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{retired from}} the {{practice}} of law in 1989. In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of Gentleman From Kentucky, a Kentucky Educational Television documentary about his life, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington. He had been preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine, on February 3, 1985. On February 26, 1991, Kentucky's two senators, Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell, gave speeches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper's memory. Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Detective Gibson, {{who was in}} plainclothes, {{was shot}} after the suspect entered DeLay's office. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Gibson was able to return fire and wound the suspect, who was apprehended in that office. A female tourist was grazed by bullets on her {{shoulder}} and face. She was treated for her injuries and released. Also injured was USCP Officer Douglas McMillian. Future Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee, a heart surgeon who had been presiding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> just before the shooting, resuscitated the gunman and accompanied him to D.C.

5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor,</b> but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E
5|$|In January 1827, the General Assembly {{considered}} {{whether to}} elect U.S. Senator John Randolph {{for a full}} six-year term. Randolph was a contentious figure; although he shared the staunch states' rights views held {{by most of the}} Virginia legislature, he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor,</b> which put his allies in an awkward position. Furthermore, he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President John Quincy Adams and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The nationalists of the Democratic-Republican Party, who supported Adams and Clay, were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature. They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states' rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator's reputation. They approached Tyler, and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat. Tyler repeatedly declined the offer, endorsing Randolph as the best candidate, but the political pressure continued to mount. Eventually he agreed to accept the seat if chosen. On the day of the vote, one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between the two candidates—Tyler was merely more agreeable than Randolph. The incumbent's supporters, though, contended that Tyler's election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration. The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115–110, and he resigned his governorship on March 4, 1827, as his Senate term began.|$|E

25|$|On the Fourth of July in 1856, proclamations of President Pierce led {{to nearly}} 500 U.S. Army troops {{arriving}} in Topeka from Ft. Leavenworth and Ft. Riley.

25|$|In 1965, California's George Murphy {{joined the}} Senate, and kept candy {{in his desk}} to offer his colleagues, and for himself, though eating is not allowed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor.</b> When he left the Senate after a six-year term, other Republican {{senators}} maintained the custom. The nascent tradition did not become publicly known until the mid-1980s, when Washington Senator Slade Gorton disclosed it in announcing {{that he would be}} sitting at the Candy Desk.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2005, {{during the}} hearing on Judge John Roberts's {{nomination}} for Chief Justice of the United States, Feingold {{was one of}} three Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of sending Roberts's nomination to the floor for a full vote. He also announced that he would vote to confirm Roberts. Feingold graduated from Harvard Law School the same year as Roberts, 1979.

25|$|Boxer {{voted against}} John Bolton's {{nomination}} for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and filibustered him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor.</b> As {{a result of}} the strong Democratic opposition Bolton could not obtain Senate approval. However, President Bush bypassed the Senate by employing the constitutional right of recess appointment, only the second time such an appointment has been used for a United States ambassador to the United Nations since the UN's founding in 1945. Recess appointments themselves have been used numerous times by various presidents.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Kaufman, {{along with}} Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), {{introduced}} {{an amendment to}} the then-proposed Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Brown–Kaufman amendment. The amendment would have limited the nondeposit liabilities of banks to two percent of gross domestic product, effectively curtailing the size to which banks could grow. Kaufman stated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> his intention to recapture the spirit of the Glass–Steagall Act, passed in 1933, which had been rescinded in 1999. The amendment failed in a Senate vote of 61 to 33 on May 6, 2010.|$|E
25|$|With {{important}} Congressional elections {{scheduled for}} November, the crisis became enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator Kenneth Keating (R-New York), who received his information from Cuban exiles in Florida, warned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> that the Soviet Union may be constructing a missile base in Cuba. He charged the Kennedy administration of covering up {{a major threat}} to the US. Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.|$|E

25|$|Women {{were not}} allowed to wear {{trousers}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> US <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> until 1993. In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore trousers onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear trousers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor so long as they also wore a jacket.|$|R
50|$|As with later assassinations, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Lawrence {{was part of}} a conspiracy. While nobody denied Lawrence's involvement, many people, including Jackson, believed that he may have been supported or put up to carrying out the assassination attempt by the President's political enemies. Senator John C. Calhoun made a statement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> that he was not connected to the attack. Jackson believed that Calhoun, an old enemy of his, was {{at the bottom of the}} attempt.|$|R
25|$|The omnibus bill, despite Clay's efforts, {{failed in}} a crucial vote on July 31 with the {{majority}} of his Whig Party and many Southern Democrats opposed. Clay announced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor</b> the next day that he intended to persevere and pass each individual part of the bill. Clay was physically exhausted; the tuberculosis that would eventually kill him had begun to take its toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in Newport, Rhode Island. Douglas separated the bills and guided them through the Senate. Each individual bill managed to pass, because it had the support not only of moderates, but of either the pro-slavery or anti-slavery senators, depending on who the bill was meant to favor. Combined, these two groups were able to crush the third.|$|E
25|$|On April 21, 1960, Simon {{married his}} first wife, Jeanne Hurley Simon, {{a member of}} the state legislature.

She later became a successful lawyer, author, and chair of National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. She died in February 2000 of brain cancer. Upon her death, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin delivered a tribute to Mrs. Simon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>floor.</b> Their daughter, Sheila Simon, became the 46th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in January, 2011. She previously served as a councilwoman in Carbondale, Illinois and was a law professor at Southern Illinois University.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, {{it would have been easy}} for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>floor,</b> if it somehow came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
