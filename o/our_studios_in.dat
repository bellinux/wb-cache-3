5000|$|Upon {{graduating in}} 1979, Lasseter {{immediately}} obtained {{a job as}} an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation mostly due to his success with Lady and the Lamp. [...] To put that in perspective, the studio had reviewed approximately 10,000 portfolios in the late 1970s in search of talent, then selected only about 150 candidates as apprentices, of which only about 45 were kept on permanently. In the fall of 1979, Disney animator Mel Shaw told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "John's got an instinctive feel for character and movement and shows every indication of blossoming here at <b>our</b> <b>studios</b> ... <b>In</b> time, he'll make a fine contribution." ...|$|E
5000|$|Says Rogue: [...] "I didn't {{want to do}} Rogue Wave unless I {{felt really}} excited again, like it was when we were {{starting}} out. So Pat and I hadn't hung out in like a year, and we just started playing <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> <b>in</b> Oakland, {{and as soon as}} we started, it felt right. Right away, it felt inevitable {{that we were going to}} work on these songs and have a new record; we need to kind of start over and start with a new label and do all new things and it feels good. I feel like we're a whole new band now. We are! We have all new players." ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{theoretical}} part I explain {{the origin of}} the puppet and puppetry and their history and development across the world and in Slovenia. Then I explain the concept of the art of puppetry and it's significance from the educational point of view. I describe various types of puppets and puppet techniques. I represent technical elements of the puppet play – making of the puppets, puppet stage, scene, costumes, props and the importance of material and colour selection in puppet theatre. I describe the procedure of making a performance. In the practical part I describe the procedure of making the puppet for the play » The tell-tale heart«, where I cooperated as a visual artist and the maker of the puppet. In the education – research part I conducted five classes, {{an hour and a half}} each, working on the art workshops for children. The workshops were led together with two friends (painters) <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> <b>in</b> Šiška. For this purpose i wrote the lesson plans. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by a {{tendency}} towards {{the development of}} international design and construction consortia, the paper explores the application of information technology in order to add an international and multicultural dimension to <b>our</b> Design <b>Studios.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the paper describes how a group of 4 Mexican design professors offers distance education to a Design <b>Studio</b> <b>in</b> the U. S. and how, in a reciprocal way, 4 American construction professors offer distance education to a Construction <b>Studio</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. Both groups of professors and students make extensive use of the Internet and a T 1 dedicated line for compressed video. In addition to the experience previously mentioned, the paper elaborates on potential applications of the "Reciprocal Distance Education" model at university and professional levels. The paper presents conclusions that place particular attention {{in the evaluation of}} information resources. In the same way, some conclusions address the administrative an faculty structures that make possible the implementation of the model...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{generally}} successful for transferring software engineering knowledge to industry through {{various forms of}} education. However, many challenges in software engineering training remain. A key amongst these is how best to energise software engineering education with real-world software engineering practices. This paper describes our experience of delivering a radically different approach based {{on the notion of}} a Software Design Studio. The Software Design Studio is both a lab for students engaged in conceiving, designing and developing software products as well as an approach for teaching software engineering in the lab which emphasizes practical hands-on work and experimentation. The feedback on the Software Design Studio – from both staff and students – has been outstanding. Although the programme is designed as a small, elite programme there is interest to see if the teaching methods can be transferred across to the much larger undergraduate programme in Computer Science. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of how <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> works <b>in</b> practice so that others, thinking of taking a studio or studio-inspired approach, can use in designing their own courses...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{initially}} {{announcing a}} break after supporting Wasting Light, Grohl later stated in January 2013 that the band had started writing material for an eighth studio album. On February 20, 2013, at the Brit Awards, Grohl {{said he was}} flying back to America the following day to start work on the next album. In an August 2013 interview with XFM, Grohl announced that their next album was slated for a 2014 release, saying: [...] "Well, I’ll tell you, we have been <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> writing and <b>in</b> {{the past few weeks}} we’ve written an album {{and we are going to}} make this album in a way that no-one’s ever done before and we’re pretty excited about it...

5000|$|According to the band, the EP is a {{collection}} of our more 'settled' numbers. More reserved, with not a distortion pedal in sight, this lovely EP is a realisation of a plan that's been kicking around our collective brains since before we were signed in 2002. Where in the past we've crowbarred-in every single dynamic, idea and style we could think of into a record, we thought it best this time to present a more thematic and cohesive collection, so's not to disrupt the more fainted-hearted listener from their blub-induced slumber. Still, it covers plenty of ground, and features a fair few Oceansize firsts such as trumpets, pedal-steel guitar as well as a bit of pumping techno and some additional vocals from Kate Ray. It is also the first Oceansize record to be made <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own as-yet-unnamed <b>studio</b> <b>in</b> Manchester.|$|R
5|$|We were <b>in</b> a <b>studio</b> <b>in</b> New York, {{this place}} called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from <b>our</b> <b>studio,</b> and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|R
2500|$|In July 2016, Rock Sound {{reported}} that the band {{was in the process}} of recording. Recording took place at the band's personal <b>studio,</b> Titan <b>Studios</b> <b>in</b> Watford. Here, the band recorded all of the guitar and bass parts, which were engineered by Sansom. Most of the guitar tracks were recorded clean, and re-amped later on. Duce described the recording process as: [...] "Me, Ben and Dan sitting <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> running through things in a pretty leisurely way." [...] The songs were recorded in batches of two at a time, according to Duce, [...] "like a production line".

2500|$|In 1930, Warner Bros. {{announced}} {{the consolidation of}} its executive offices with those of First National Pictures, with the executive offices being moved from the Sunset Boulevard studio to the First National <b>Studios</b> <b>in</b> Burbank, California.
