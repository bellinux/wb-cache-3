5|$|The last carucage {{was imposed}} in 1224, after {{which most of}} the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on {{moveable}} <b>or</b> <b>personal</b> property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, <b>or</b> <b>personal</b> motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes.

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, <b>or</b> <b>personal</b> dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.|$|E

5|$|News {{of these}} {{conditions}} was relayed to Britain, mainly by William Howard Russell, special correspondent of The Times. Hearing the news, Samuel Morton Peto, {{one of the leading}} railway contractors of the day, offered with his partners Edward Betts and Thomas Brassey, to build at cost, without any contract <b>or</b> <b>personal</b> advantage, a railway to transport supplies from the port of Balaclava to the troops outside Sevastopol. They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava. The offer was accepted and the contractors began to obtain supplies, to purchase or hire ships, and to recruit the men, who included specialists and navvies. The fleet set sail on December 21 and arrived at the beginning of February.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, <b>or</b> <b>personal,</b> and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E

5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain <b>or</b> <b>personal</b> creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software <b>or</b> <b>personal</b> decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
