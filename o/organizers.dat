5|$|In July 2010, RA <b>organizers</b> {{announced}} that the film festival would move from October 2010 to April 2011 because of funding shortfalls. One news source reported that RA <b>organizers</b> had intended to hold an October film festival, but a community fundraiser brought in only $5,000—far less than hoped, and not enough to allow an October festival to occur. The move to April was prompted, in part, by the hope that a $75,000 D.C. government grant would allow the festival to occur. However, on March 8, 2011, RA officials cancelled the April event because of continuing heavy debt and because several grants had not been awarded to the organization.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{embryonic}} stem cells differentiate into gastrula <b>organizer</b> cells that express typical markers and induce secondary axes when injected into frog embryos. Here, we report that these human <b>organizer</b> cells express DUXO (DUX of the <b>Organizer),</b> a novel member of the double-homeobox (DUX) family of transcription factors, a group of genes unique to placental mammals. Both of DUXO's homeodomains share high similarity with those of Siamois and Twin, the initial inducers of the amphibian gastrula <b>organizer.</b> DUXO overexpression in human embryoid bodies induces <b>organizer</b> related genes, whereas its knock down hampers formation of the <b>organizer</b> and its derivatives. Finally, we show that DUXO regulates GOOSECOID, the canonical <b>organizer</b> marker, in a direct manner, suggesting that DUXO is a major regulator of human <b>organizer</b> formation...|$|R

40|$|Establishment of the {{vertebrate}} body axis {{requires the}} formation of the <b>organizer</b> domain during early embryogenesis. In amphibians, this domain {{is referred to as the}} Spemann <b>Organizer</b> and is essential for germ layer patterning and formation of the embryonic body axes. The Wnt and Nodal signaling pathways are both essential for <b>organizer</b> formation, but how these signals are integrated to influence gene expression in the <b>organizer</b> is largely unknown. The Wnt pathway activates expression of two transactivators, Siamois (Sia) and Twin (Twn), which mediate <b>organizer</b> formation downstream of Wnt. Expression of Sia or Twn is sufficient to induce an ectopic axis, suggesting they play an essential role in <b>organizer</b> formation. However, whether Sia/Twn play equivalent roles in <b>organizer</b> formation, or whether both are required for all aspects of <b>organizer</b> formation in not clear. Here, we report that knockdown of Sia/Twn together, but not individually, disrupts <b>organizer</b> gene expression and axis formation. We identify the Sia/Twn binding site within the promoter of the <b>organizer</b> gene Goosecoid (Gsc). Sia/Twn form homodimers and heterodimers through direct homeodomain interaction and both dimer forms are found at the endogenous Gsc promoter. The Gsc promoter also contains a Nodal responsive distal element, suggesting that Sia/Twn cooperate with Nodal signals in the transcription of Gsc. We find that Wnt and Nodal effectors synergize to activate transcription of three <b>organizer</b> genes, Gsc, Cerberus (Cer), and Chordin (Chd). Sia/Twn and the Nodal effectors FoxH 1 and Smad 2 / 3 occupy the promoters of these genes in vivo and their occupancy increases with active signaling from both pathways. This suggests that a complex consisting of Sia/Twn and Nodal effectors forms at <b>organizer</b> gene promoters. Consistent with this, p 300 is recruited to <b>organizer</b> gene promoters in response to Sia/Twn or Nodal signals. Thus, Sia/Twn interact with Nodal effectors to regulate the spatial and temporal expression of <b>organizer</b> genes, suggesting a general mechanism for the regulation of <b>organizer</b> gene expression in the early embryo. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSignaling inputs from {{multiple}} pathways {{are essential for}} the establishment of distinct cell and tissue types in the embryo. Therefore, multiple signals must be integrated to activate gene expression and confer cell fate, but little is known about how this occurs at the level of target gene promoters. During early embryogenesis, Wnt and Nodal signals are required for formation of the Spemann <b>organizer,</b> which is essential for germ layer patterning and axis formation. Signaling by both Wnt and Nodal pathways is required for the expression of multiple <b>organizer</b> genes, suggesting that integration of these signals is required for <b>organizer</b> formation. Here, we demonstrate transcriptional cooperation between the Wnt and Nodal pathways in the activation of the <b>organizer</b> genes Goosecoid (Gsc), Cerberus (Cer), and Chordin (Chd). Combined Wnt and Nodal signaling synergistically activates transcription of these <b>organizer</b> genes. Effectors of both pathways occupy the Gsc, Cer and Chd promoters and effector occupancy is enhanced with active Wnt and Nodal signaling. This suggests that, at <b>organizer</b> gene promoters, a stable transcriptional complex containing effectors of both pathways forms in response to combined Wnt and Nodal signaling. Consistent with this idea, the histone acetyltransferase p 300 is recruited to <b>organizer</b> promoters in a Wnt and Nodal effector-dependent manner. Taken together, these results offer a mechanism for spatial and temporal restriction of <b>organizer</b> gene transcription by the integration of two major signaling pathways, thus establishing the Spemann <b>organizer</b> domain...|$|R

40|$|Background: Argyrophilic {{nucleolar}} <b>organizer</b> {{region is}} higher in malignant nuclei as compared to reactive and benign nuclei. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the role of Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region and its extent in differentiating benign and malignant lesions, particularly with respect to follicular neoplasms of the thyroid. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, cross sectional study which included 110 patients presenting with thyroid swelling. The fi ne needle aspiration smears were studied by conventional methods and silver staining for Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region. In 50 cases, diagnosis was confi rmed by histopathology. The Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region count was done and the mean Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region count per nucleus was calculated along with pattern of distribution. Results: Mean Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region count was higher in neoplastic as compared to non-neoplastic and infl ammatory lesions. Papillary carcinoma had the highest mean Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region count (5. 40 ± 0. 86) and the lowest count was seen in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (2. 10 ± 0. 36). Higher mean Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region count was recorded in follicular carcinoma (4. 84 ± 1. 42) as compared to follicular adenoma (3. 5 ± 0. 27) which was found to be statistically signifi cant (P< 0. 05). Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region dots were arranged in clusters in colloid goiter whereas scattered discrete black dots were seen in neoplastic lesions. Conclusion: Argyrophilic nucleolar <b>organizer</b> region study of thyroid can be used as an additional diagnostic adjunct with cytomorphological features to differentiate benign and malignant follicular neoplasms.
