5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys.

Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Gossip soon spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> {{an illegitimate}} child.

Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
