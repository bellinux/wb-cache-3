5|$|The Bill Thomas Cheetah American sports/racing car, a Chevrolet-based coupe first {{designed}} and driven in 1963, {{was an attempt}} to challenge Carroll Shelby's Shelby Cobra in American sports car competition of the 1960s era. Due to only two dozen or fewer chassis ever being built, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> of these being complete cars, the Cheetah was never homologated for competition beyond prototype status, with its production ending in 1966.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 {{the island was}} finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number {{and the lack of}} a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Berlingske {{reported}} that from 2015 the enlarged harbour {{was expected to}} attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> smaller ships at present. The larger vessels will carry up to 3,500 passengers. Port of Skagen was covering {{the cost of the}} work which amounted to DKK 226 million (US $41 million). The new harbour would provide new jobs increasing the workforce from some 2,000 today to 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, were reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town was also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery. Grave 42 was a deep, wide pit in which a high-status individual was buried on top of a wooden bed with iron fittings. The body lying on the bed was most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found in the grave is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society. Such burials are highly unusual; <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> are known in the whole of the UK, and the one at Street House is the most northerly known.|$|E
5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E

5|$|The first manager {{appointed}} was Harry Thompson in July 1949, {{soon after}} the club turned professional. In a nine-year spell he led the team to the Southern League title in 1953, {{as well as the}} Southern League Cup in 1953 and 1954. He was replaced by Arthur Turner in 1958, who would become the longest-serving manager in the club's history, serving more than a decade in charge. Turner led United to back-to-back Southern League titles, of which the second, in 1962, resulted in their election to the Football League. Promotion followed from the Fourth Division in 1965, and the club were crowned Third Division champions three years later. Turner left the club nine months after this success. Over the next thirteen years, five managers took charge. Ron Saunders was in charge for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> games, moving to Norwich City {{at the end of the}} 1968–69 season. Gerry Summers was manager for six years, before being replaced by Mick Brown. During Brown's four-year run, United were relegated back to the Third Division after spending eight years in the Second.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the first {{production}} of Boris Godunov in February 1874, Mussorgsky had taken part in the ill-fated Mlada project (in the course of which he had made a choral version of his Night on Bald Mountain) and had begun Khovanshchina. Though far from being a critical success – and in spite of receiving <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so performances – the popular reaction in favour of Boris made this the peak of Mussorgsky's career.|$|E
25|$|About 9,200 DMC-12s were {{produced}} between January 1981 and December 1982. Almost {{a fifth of}} these {{were produced}} in October 1981. About a thousand 1982 models were produced between February and May 1982, {{and all of these}} cars had the VINs changed after purchase by Consolidated to make them appear as 1983 models. There are the 15XXX, 16XXX, and 17XXX VINs which were originally 10XXX, 11XXX, and 12XXX VINs. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> 12XXXX VIN cars still exist.

The insurgents numbered about 600 soldiers, {{divided into four}} companies; the unit had <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so cavalrymen. Polish forces included the twenty or so Italians from the Garibaldi's Legion and several French volunteers, remnants of the Zouaves of Death. Russian forces were composed of three companies (7th and 9th companies of the Vitebsk Infantry Regiment and the 4th Company of the 7th Riflemen Battalion) and were commanded by prince Szachowski, commander of the Olkusz garrison.|$|E
25|$|Shanawdithit made ten {{drawings}} for Cormack, {{some of which}} showed parts of the island, and others illustrated Beothuk implements and dwellings, along with tribal notions and myths. As she explained her drawings, she taught Cormack Beothuk vocabulary. She told him there were far fewer Beothuk than twenty years previously. To her knowledge, {{at the time she}} was taken, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> Beothuk survived. Despite medical care from the doctor William Carson, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis in Botwood on June 6, 1829. At the time there was no known cure for the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of evacuating these difficult to defend zones was considered, but {{the policy of}} Haganah was set by David Ben-Gurion. He stated that 'what the Jewish people have has to be conserved. No Jewish person should abandon his or her house, farm, kibbutz or job without authorization. Every outpost, every colony, whether it is isolated or not, must be occupied {{as though it were}} Tel Aviv itself. No Jewish settlement was evacuated until the invasion of May 1948. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> kibbutzim in Galilee {{as well as those of}} Gush Etzion sent women and children into the safer interior zones.|$|E

25|$|Temporary amateur radio {{licences}} {{were issued}} from 1946, {{after the end}} of World War II. By 1948, there were 50 amateur radio operators in India, although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> were active. Following India's independence in 1947, the first amateur radio organization, the Amateur Radio Club of India was inaugurated on 15 May 1948 at the School of Signals at Mhow in Madhya Pradesh. The club headquarters was later moved to New Delhi, where it was renamed the Amateur Radio Society of India (ARSI) on 15 May 1954. As India's oldest amateur radio organization, ARSI became its representative at the International Amateur Radio Union.|$|E
25|$|This annual pilgrimage, {{called the}} Rosh Hashana kibbutz, drew {{thousands}} of Hasidim {{from all over}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and even Poland until 1917, when the Bolshevik Revolution forced it to continue clandestinely. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so Hasidim risked making the annual pilgrimage during the Communist era, as the authorities regularly raided the gathering and often arrested and imprisoned worshippers. Beginning in the mid-1960s, Hasidim who lived outside Russia began to sneak into Uman to pray at Rebbe Nachman's grave during the year. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the gates were reopened entirely. In 2008, approximately 25,000 {{people from all over}} the world participated in this annual pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Research by {{historian}} Paul Finkelman {{reveals that}} Marshall owned hundreds of slaves, {{contrary to the}} conventional belief that he owned <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so slaves. Marshall also engaged in the buying and selling of slaves throughout his life. As the then Ariel F. Sallows Chair in Human Rights, Finkelman first presented his research at the College of Law, University of Saskatchewan. Finkelman's research {{will be published in}} his forthcoming book, Supreme Injustice: Slavery in the Nation’s Highest Court, to be published by the Harvard University Press. Finkelman suggests that Marshall's substantial slave holdings may have influenced him to render judicial decisions in favor of slave owners.|$|E

25|$|In the 2011 census 70.7% of Barrow's {{population}} stated {{themselves as}} being Christian. People stating no religion or chose not to state totalled 28.4% combined. Other religious groups represented 0.9% of the population, with Islam and Buddhism prevailing as {{the first and second}} most common groups. Conishead Priory, the first Kadampa Buddhist centre in the west, is home to around 100 Buddhists and is located off the Barrow to Ulverston Coast Road within the South Lakeland district. Historically Barrow was home to a notable Ashkenazi Jewish community that peaked in size during the 1930s with a synagogue in the town. Despite this it closed in 1974 and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> Jews were recorded by the 2011 census.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November 1673 Sobieski added a {{major victory}} to his list, this time {{defeating}} the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn and capturing the fortress located there. The news of the battle coincided {{with the death of}} King Michal the day before the battle. This made Sobieski one of the leading figures of the state, so on 19 May the following year, he was elected monarch of the Commonwealth. His candidacy was almost universally supported, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so members of the diet opposing him (mainly centered around magnates of the Lithuanian Pac family). In light of the war, requiring Sobieski to be on the front lines, the coronation ceremony was significantly delayed – he was crowned John III almost two years later, on 2 February 1676.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of September, the Royalist {{garrison}} of Southsea Castle consisted of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> men. On the night of 4 September, a Parliamentarian force of 400 infantry equipped with ladders and backed by cavalry set out to attack the castle. Although the force was spotted and fired on by the guns of Portsmouth, {{they were able to}} make to the seaward side of the castle. Simultaneously, a small party approached the main gate and called on the castle to surrender. Captain Challoner was at the time somewhat inebriated and asked them to come back in the morning. At around this time, the guns of Portsmouth once more opened fire on the assaulting force, and the Parliamentarians responded by scaling the walls and capturing the castle without further opposition. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being recaptured.|$|E
