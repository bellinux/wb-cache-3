500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Leaves is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1995 album Washing Machine, which was released {{shortly after the}} band concluded their stint headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. With the money they had made at the festival, the band decided to build a recording studio, called Echo Canyon, on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan. The span of nearly three years between Washing Machine and A Thousand Leaves also represented the longest gap between studio albums in Sonic Youth's career at the time. Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore explained that the band needed a break, noting {{that they had been}} touring non-stop for 16 years. He said, [...] "We're having children, we're getting older, let's just cool <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and build this workshop, and go that way, work that route." [...] In their new studio, the band began writing new songs from extended improvisations in rehearsal. Several instrumental jams were released as extended plays through the band's own record label, Sonic Youth Recordings, and distributed by Smells Like Records, an independent record label previously formed by drummer Steve Shelley.

He also said that the band was going to explore [...] "electronic sounds for the next record".|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, Launch Radio Networks {{reported}} that Sully Erna has {{started working on}} his solo album. Although he wasn't exactly sure what shape it will take, Erna told Launch Radio Networks that [...] "I've been putting some thought into it," [...] he said. [...] "I actually have some stuff that I'm doing on the side right now. I don't know when I'm gonna kind of unleash something like that, and I don't know really what it's gonna be yet. I {{have a couple of}} different ideas, and I'm not sure what and when it's gonna happen, but of course Godsmack is our lifeblood and we don't have any plans on trying to break this thing up. But, you know, we do want to venture <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and just do some side stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scotty Moore {{described}} their first session, {{resulting in the}} recording of [...] "That's Alright Mama": We were taking a break and, all of sudden, Elvis started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool. Then Bill Black picked up his bass and began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, and stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up. Try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again'. So we kinda talked it over and figured <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> what we were doin'. We ran it again, and of course Sam is listenin'. 'Bout the third or fourth time through, we just cut it. It was basically a rhythm record. It wasn't any great thing. It wasn't Sam tellin' him what to do. Elvis was joking around, just doing what come naturally, what he felt.|$|E

[...] "One of {{the girls}} at that dance the other night told me a great many queer facts about your taboos on these domestic subjects; so I know how stringent and how unreasoning they are. And, indeed, I found <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> for myself; for there was one nice girl there, to whom I took a very great fancy; and I {{was just going to}} kiss her as I said good-night, when she drew back suddenly, almost as if I'd struck her, though we'd been talking together quite confidentially a minute before. I could see she thought I really meant to insult her. Of course, I explained it was only what I'd have done to any nice girl at home under similar circumstances; but she didn't seem to believe me. And the oddest part of it all was, that all the time we were dancing I had my arm round her waist, as all the other men had theirs round their partners; and at home we consider it a much greater proof of confidence and affection to be allowed to place your arm round a lady's waist than merely to kiss her." ...|$|E

5000|$|My {{last year}} at ABC, I was working {{overnights}} anchoring this newscast, then during the day at 20/20.

West, who was vocal in his displeasure with past award snubs, responded onstage during a concert on the Watch the Throne Tour, saying [...] "That's my fault for dropping Watch the Throne and Dark Fantasy the same year.

5000|$|Regarding his {{coaching}} philosophy, Statham said, [...] "We do things consistently well. Our program is sound. We're very team-oriented, and we've {{tried to sell}} that from the very beginning. When you play hard and play together and do things fundamentally sound, you're going to be competitive. Our primary focus is to play hard, play well {{and try to do}} it as a team." [...] Statham's on-court demeanor does not include yelling and ref-baiting [...] Said Statham, [...] "I don't like the television color commentators (saying) how you gotta work the referee and draw a T.

50|$|After {{finishing}} {{seventh in}} League Two, City {{were entered into}} the end-of-season play-offs to determine who would get promoted to League One for the 2013-14 season. Bradford were against fourth-placed Burton Albion in the semi-finals and played them over two legs. The first leg did not start too well for the Bantams as Burton's Calvin Zola scored twice in the first half-hour to give Burton a 2-0 advantage early on. Bradford were awarded a penalty after Garry Thompson's shot was handled in the area, and Nahki Wells calmly slotted the penalty to make the score 2-1. A minute before half-time, Burton struck again after Alex McDonald crossed the ball to Robbie Weir, who scored at the near post to take Burton to a 3-1 lead. As they have done all season, Bradford came <b>out</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of fight and Thompson scored in the 74th minute with a thunderous drive after cutting inside from the right. The 3-2 loss meant that the Bantams would have to win by two or more goals in the second leg to reach the final.|$|R
6000|$|Silas Foster, by {{the time}} we {{concluded}} our meal, had stript off his coat, and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire, with a lapstone, a hammer, a piece of sole leather, and some waxed-ends, in order to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots; he being, in his own phrase, [...] "something of a dab" [...] (whatever degree of skill that may imply) at the shoemaking business. We heard the tap of his hammer at intervals {{for the rest of the}} evening. The remainder of the party adjourned to the sitting-room. Good Mrs. Foster took her knitting-work, and soon fell fast asleep, still keeping her needles in brisk movement, and, to the best of my observation, absolutely footing <b>a</b> stocking <b>out</b> of the texture of a dream. And a very substantial stocking it seemed to be. One of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel, and the other appeared to be making a ruffle, for her Sunday's wear, <b>out</b> of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of embroidered muslin which Zenobia had probably given her.|$|R
500|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica and Lisa Origliasso {{together}} with Shelly Peiken and Greg Wells – Wells also produced the track. The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and <b>out</b> for just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we went through that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> when things started getting full on with us. It went from one extreme, where no one knew who we were, to the complete opposite".|$|R

We used the same guns and gimmicks and wardrobes with the waistlines let <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> The script, unlike the old shows, is played strictly for comedy. It calls for us to be ten years older than when we were last seen. There are a lot more laughs than adventure." ...|$|E

I love Annie Kirkbride and we have a right good laugh. I think that would be quite funny. Or Liz McDonald. I'm really pleased Bev Callard is coming back. That would cause problems for Steve and I'd love that, to be sat there with his mum on the couch." [...] It was later revealed that Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) would be Jason's new love interest despite Jason recently being in a sexual relationship with Eva's mother Stella (Michelle Collins). It was revealed that Stella would be livid that her daughter is dating her ex, but eventually calms down as she already has enough to worry about as her killer partner Karl Munro (John Michie) has left the street in dramatic circumstances. Speaking of the romance, Tyldesley said to ITV: [...] "She's never really entertained the thought of anything serious with Jason in the past, obviously especially because he used to be with her mum. But she just begins to see that he's a really genuine, nice sweet guy. [...] "Whilst Jason and Eva are trying to help Stella <b>out,</b> there is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of flirting that starts, and Sean kindly points out to Eva how fit Jason is! She continued: [...] "We can expect, as always, a lot more drama for the Prices. Obviously Jason used to be with Stella, so when Stella finds <b>out</b> that there's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of cavorting going on between him and her daughter, things might blow up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> God knows what Gloria's going to say!" ...|$|R

Talking of the racing club, Morison stated – [...] "I've got lots of kennels myself, lots of animals, lots of dogs. So me and Grant got together bought a couple of dogs and it's spiralled <b>out</b> of control <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> because we've bought seven now in the space of about three months.
