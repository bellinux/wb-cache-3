With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley's projected lifetime could be as long as 10million years. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, {{within the next few}} tens of thousands of years, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years. Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80–90% over the last 2000–3000 revolutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the new line is to allow {{regional}} and express trains to run directly between Asker Station, Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station, without being slowed and delayed by commuter trains that make frequent stops at intermediate stations. The Asker Line will improve regularity, and capacity will increase from 12 to 26 trains per hour in each direction. Travel time from Asker to Skøyen Station will be reduced from 20 to 13 minutes. The line has received criticism for not being a true high-speed line, and for Lysaker Station not being in compliance with accessibility requirements. Similar parallel, high-speed lines have been <b>or</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> built northeast and southeast of Oslo.|$|E
