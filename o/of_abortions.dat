40|$|The {{legality}} <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> {{remains one}} <b>of</b> the mostly highly contested issues surrounded by debate and activism. The legalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> is best {{understood in the}} American context with the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade that has shaped the abortion debate in the U. S. ever since. The legality, cultural opinions, legitimacy, and prevalence <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> vary from country to country; views are never static, but are constantly adjusting to global and local conditions, as well as changing economic and social needs. Abortion politics are often essentialized to a dichotomy of proponents and opponents <b>of</b> legal <b>abortion.</b> Nevertheless, this essay is intended to complicate this simplification by considering the legalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in the U. S. {{as well as in}} India. Despite numerous studies <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> politics in the U. S. and India, scholars have failed to situate and explore the two in relation to one another. In doing so, the processes and social movements that preceded and followed the legalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> in the American context and Indian context emerge as a complex puzzle, one with fascinating contradictions and implications. In the U. S., the women’s movement sought to end state regulation of abortion; in India, feminists of the women’s movement sought state regulation and restriction <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> Moreover...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This article {{examines}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> legalization on fertility rates in the United States. METHODS: Fertility rates were compared over time between states that varied in the timing <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> legalization. RESULTS: States legalizing abortion experienced a 4 % decline in fertility relative to states where the legal status <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> was unchanged. The relative reductions in births to teens, women more than 35 years of age, non-White women, and unmarried women were considerably larger. If women did not travel between states to obtain an abortion, the estimated impact <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> legalization on birth rates would be about 11 %. CONCLUSIONS: A complete recriminalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> nationwide could result in 440, 000 additional births per year.
