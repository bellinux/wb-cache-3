5000|$|There are {{at least}} two {{instances}} of cross dressing balls that have been documented in England. The first one was known through a police raid of a ball celebrated in Temperance Hall, in the Hulme area of Manchester. On September 24, 1880, the chief constable of Manchester received an anonymous information about an event [...] "of an immoral character" [...] that was about to take place in the Temperance Hall of Hulme. The detective Jerome Caminada introduced two policemen dressed as women amongst those that had been gathering in the ball room after 9 p.m. Of the 47 men that congregated, all dressed in the most wild dresses, 22 as women; a pair was dressed as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and another as Romeo and Juliet. Detective Caminada <b>oberved</b> <b>the</b> ball from a neighboring roof, all young men between 20 and 30 years old, that had begun dancing about 10 p.m.; every now and then, a couple disappeared into a side room. About 1 a.m., after detective Caminada thought enough crimes had been committed, he gained entry shouting the password [...] "sister" [...] in an effeminate manner. After the door was opened, the police raided the building, and detained all participants. The trial showed that the dancers were not from Manchester, they were regulars of similar balls that were organized in several cities, as Leeds, or Nottingham. The judge, thinking about the possible scandal for <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> let them go free.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} fluid {{dynamics}} video showing {{the behavior of}} drops of liquid oxygen, at room temperature. Due to their low boiling point, these drops levitate on a cushion of their own vapour. This property gives them a high mobility, as known more generally in such Leidenfrost situations. But liquid oxygen is also paramagnetic, and thus likely to be manipulated using a magnet. It is first shown that {{the shape of the}} drop can be modified by changing the drop/magnet distance; approaching the magnet acts as reinforcing gravity, so that the drops get flattened by this action. The transformation is of course reversible: as the magnet is withdrawn, the liquid recovers its quasi-spherical shape. Magnets {{can also be used to}} trap the oxygen drops. As they pass above a magnet, they slow down significantly, a consequence of their deformation: despite a very low friction, the vibrations induced by the drop deformations represent an important source of dissipation: below a well-defined velocity, drops can even be stopped in the magnetic trap. Quicker ones can be decelerated and then captured by series of magnets. <b>Oberving</b> <b>the</b> same events from the top reveals the complex shapes adopted by the liquid as it crosses the traps.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Recent research shows thioridazine {{which is a}} kind of phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs can inhibit the proliferation of various tumor cells in vitro, but the role of thioridazine on lung cancer has not been reported. So we choose PC 9 cell lines as the research object, the aim is to <b>oberve</b> <b>the</b> killing effect of thioridazine on PC 9 cells and investigate its possible mechanism. Methods After being treated with different concentrations of thioridazine, the proliferation of PC 9 cells was determined by methyl thiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The expressions of cell cycle-associated protein CyclinD 1 and apoptosis-related proteins Caspase- 3, Caspase- 8, Caspase- 9, Bcl- 2, Bax and Bcl-xl were detected by Western blot. Results The proliferation of PC 9 cells was significantly inhibited by thioridazine in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry showed that cell cycle was arrested in G 0 /G 1 phase and the apoptotic rates were significantly increased with the increasing concentration of thioridazine. Compared with the control group, the differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Western blot analysis showed that, compared with the control group, thioridazine reduced the expressions of CyclinD 1, Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xl (P< 0. 01) and increased the expression of Bax (P< 0. 01). In the mean time, thioridazine promoted the activities of Caspase- 3, Caspase- 8 and Caspase- 9 (P< 0. 01). Conclusion The mechanism of thioridazine inhibiting the proliferation of PC 9 cells may be related to stimulation of Caspase apoptotic pathway, down-regulation of CyclinD 1, Bcl- 2, Bcl-xl and up-regulation of Bax...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{luminescent}} bacterial biosensor {{was used}} to quantify bioavailable arsenic in artificial groundwater. Its light production above the back-ground emission was proportional to the arsenite con-centration in the toxicologically relevant range of 0 to 0. 5 mM. Effects of the inorganic solutes phosphate, Fe(II) and silicate on the biosensor signal were studied. Phosphate at a concentration of 0. 25 g L 1 phosphate slightly stimulated the light emission, but much less than toxicologically relevant concentrations of the much stronger inducer arsenite. No effect of phosphate was <b>oberved</b> in <b>the</b> presence of arsenite.
