25|$|A {{general-purpose}} amplifier {{with typical}} low-impedance output is used. Its output {{is connected to}} the primary of an external step-up transformer. Special-purpose transformers can tailor the system design to the project's target power levels. Multiple amplifiers can be combined together via transformers to yield higher voltage and higher current capacity lines. For instance, three 70-volt amplifiers have been used to make a 210-volt line by connecting them to a special-purpose external <b>output</b> <b>transformer</b> that has three primaries and a single secondary.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid {{amplifier}} involves {{one of two}} {{combinations of}} tube and solid-state amplification. It may have a tube power amp fed by a solid-state pre-amp circuit, as {{in most of the}} original MusicMan Amps, later amplifier models from Alamo Electronics, the Fender Super Champ XD, and the Roland Bolt amplifier. Randall Amplifiers V2 and T2 use hybrid amp technology. Alternatively, a tube pre-amp can feed a solid-state output stage, as in models from Kustom, Hartke, SWR and Vox. This approach dispenses with the need for an <b>output</b> <b>transformer</b> and easily achieves modern power levels.|$|E

In August, 1969, Eddie Kramer recorded the 4-day Woodstock Festival using three Shure M67 mixers. Shure's portable mixer line later included other models such as the M267 and 268.|$|E
50|$|Circlotron valve {{amplifier}} {{is a type}} of power amplifier utilizing symmetrical cathode-coupled bridge layout of the output stage. Original circlotrons of 1950s used <b>output</b> <b>transformers</b> to couple relatively high output impedance of vacuum tubes to low-impedance loudspeakers. Circlotron architecture, easily scalable, was eventually adapted to operate without <b>output</b> <b>transformers,</b> and present-day commercially produced circlotron models are of output transformerless (OTL) type.|$|R

50|$|Unicord {{had begun}} as a {{manufacturer}} of electrical transformers. When the original Marshalls came to the U.S., Unicord's engineers were concerned that the <b>output</b> <b>transformers</b> could not reliably handle the full output. Unicord redesigned the <b>output</b> <b>transformers</b> and told Marshall to use the Unicord design in all units shipped to the U.S., and Marshall could use the design outside the U.S. if they wanted to. Marshall did adopt the Unicord design for all their tube amps.|$|R
25|$|Generally every AC {{power line}} {{transformer}} {{acts as an}} isolation transformer, and every step up or down {{has the potential to}} form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, {{on both sides of the}} input and <b>output</b> <b>transformer</b> coils. Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} of valves (vacuum tubes), most {{loudspeakers}} had a nominal impedance of 16Ω. [...] Valve outputs require an <b>output</b> <b>transformer</b> to match the very high output impedance and voltage of the output valves to this lower impedance. [...] These transformers were commonly tapped to allow matching of the output to a multiple loudspeaker setup. [...] For example, two 16Ω loudspeakers in parallel will give an impedance of 8Ω. [...] Since the advent of solid-state amplifiers whose outputs require no transformer, the once-common multiple-impedance outputs have become rare, and lower impedance loudspeakers more common. [...] The most common nominal impedance for a single loudspeaker is now 8Ω. [...] Most solid-state amplifiers are designed to work with loudspeaker combinations of anything from 4Ω to 8Ω.|$|E

[...] With the tap placed at the anode end of the primary winding, the tube (valve) is effectively connected as a triode, and if the tap was at the supply end, as a pure pentode. [...] Blumlein discovered that if the tap was {{placed at a distance}} 15–20% down from the supply end of the <b>output</b> <b>transformer,</b> the tube or valve would combine the positive features of both the triode and the pentode design.|$|E

2500|$|Distortion is {{a feature}} {{available}} on many guitar amplifiers {{that is not}} typically found on keyboard or bass guitar amplifiers. Tube guitar amplifiers can produce distortion through pre-distortion equalization, preamp tube distortion, post-distortion EQ, power-tube distortion, tube rectifier compression, <b>output</b> <b>transformer</b> distortion, guitar speaker distortion, and guitar speaker and cabinet frequency response. Because many factors beyond preamp distortion contribute to a particular guitarist's sound, recording engineers and PA system techs typically put a microphone {{in front of the}} guitar speaker, rather than only use the guitar amp's pre-amp out signal. [...] A sound engineer or music producer may send the DI out signal from the pickups to a separate track at the same time, so they can re-amp the signal later. In contrast, it is fairly common to use a DI box with electric bass.|$|E
2500|$|Other early {{customers}} included Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who, whose {{search for}} extra volume led Marshall {{to design the}} classic 100-watt valve amplifier. Ken Bran and Dudley Craven, Marshall's developers, doubled the number of output valves, added a larger power transformer and an extra <b>output</b> <b>transformer.</b> Four of these amplifiers were built and delivered to Pete Townshend, and the Marshall Super Lead Model 1959, the original Plexi, was born in 1965. At the request of Pete Townshend, Marshall produced an 8×12-inch cabinet (soon replaced {{by a pair of}} 4×12-inch cabinets) on top of which the 1959 amplifier head was placed, giving rise to the Marshall stack, an iconic image for rock and roll. The size of the wall of Marshall stacks [...] "soon became an indicator of the band's status", even when rendered obsolete by improved PA systems; indeed, many of the [...] "ridiculously huge arrays of heads and cabs" [...] included dummies. Still, most modern 100-watt heads have roots in Marshall's design, even though they often contain many more features (or different tubes, such as the more American-sounding 6L6 tubes).|$|E
50|$|A {{particularly}} {{critical component}} is the <b>output</b> <b>transformer</b> of a valve amplifier.

50|$|The {{very high}} output {{impedance}} of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires matching transformers to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or cutting lathe heads. The transformer {{is used as}} the load, {{in place of the}} resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. <b>Output</b> <b>transformers</b> dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative.
