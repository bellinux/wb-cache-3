5|$|According to {{a verdict}} {{delivered}} by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's penal system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, with much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> {{placed on the}} comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders still were not separated from older ones, that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were not paid for the work they did.|$|E
50|$|After their 1998 release, 8 Years to Nowhere a {{selection}} of songs from previous recordings (originally called 8 Years from Nowhere to Nowhere), they decided {{to go on a}} one-year hiatus because their drummer, Greg Jacques along with Matt Switaj <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Blamed,</b> was starting a new record label, 2 Jake Records.|$|R
25|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{band members}} had other duties {{that had to}} be {{committed}} to, such as Lance Garvin and Rocky Gray's Soul Embraced, and felt {{it was time to move}} on. According to several interviews, it was only supposed to be Bruce Fitzhugh's final tour, and after he left, Cory Brandan Putman was supposed to take over Lead Vocals and Rhythm Guitar, and Bryan Gray, formerly <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Blamed</b> was to take over Lead Guitar.|$|R
5|$|Senior leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party <b>blamed</b> Dentsu for its {{defeat in}} the elections. They also said that Dentsu had charged too much for its services.|$|R
5|$|However, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for {{the decay}} and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt {{has been made to}} restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|On the Cardinals' side, {{the media}} {{expressed}} disappointment at the team's failure {{to win a}} game in the Series after recording the team's best regular season in over 60years. Many reporters believed that the Cardinals had not played up to their usual standard, and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> was directed at Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best hitters, who had combined for one hit in 39at bats in the series.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

25|$|After <b>the</b> capture <b>of</b> Allied French ships, Britain {{tried to}} {{repatriate}} the captured Free French sailors. The British hospital ship that was carrying {{them back to}} metropolitan France was sunk by the Germans, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> British for their deaths.|$|R
5|$|The Giants regressed to a 5–11 {{record in}} 1995. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the Giants' poor {{performance}} {{was placed on}} Brown. He put up lackluster numbers {{for the second straight}} year. Though the Giants defense still played well, and young players like Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead began to emerge,* Freeman, Mike. , The New York Times, October 30, 1995, accessed December 6, 2010. the Giants inspired tepid interest league-wide and sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E
5|$|The {{court held}} that it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his nearsightedness, could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had {{repeatedly}} gotten over the guardrail. According to the court, the largest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> lies with the promoters and security members. Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family.|$|E
5|$|With the win, Schilling became {{only the}} fifth pitcher to ever win a World Series {{game with a}} team from both leagues, having {{previously}} done it with National League teams, the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001. He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the Cardinals' losses {{in the first two}} games was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E

5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame,</b> for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E
5|$|Farel and Calvin {{then went}} to Bern and Zurich to plead their case. The {{resulting}} synod in Zurich placed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on Calvin for not being sympathetic enough toward the people of Geneva. It asked Bern to mediate {{with the aim of}} restoring the two ministers. The Geneva council refused to readmit the two men, who then took refuge in Basel. Subsequently, Farel received an invitation to lead the church in Neuchâtel. Calvin was invited to lead a church of French refugees in Strasbourg by that city's leading reformers, Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito. Initially, Calvin refused because Farel {{was not included in the}} invitation, but relented when Bucer appealed to him. By September 1538 Calvin had taken up his new position in Strasbourg, fully expecting that this time it would be permanent; a few months later, he applied for and was granted citizenship of the city.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame.</b> Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper {{in defiance of the}} Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> {{findings}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearings <b>blamed</b> Cohn {{rather than}} McCarthy, they are widely considered {{an important element}} of McCarthy's disgrace. After the Army–McCarthy hearings, Cohn resigned from McCarthy's staff and went into private practice.|$|R
25|$|Joseph M. Horodyski and Maurice Remy both praise Auchinleck as an underrated {{military}} leader who contributed {{the most to}} <b>the</b> successful defense <b>of</b> El Alamein and consequently <b>the</b> final defeat <b>of</b> Rommel in Africa. The two historians also criticize Churchill for the militarily unreasonable decision <b>of</b> putting <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> on Auchinleck and relieving him.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{final report}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{accident}} <b>blamed</b> it mainly on pilot error; specifically {{the inability to}} arrest <b>the</b> high rate <b>of</b> descent existing at 50ft altitude on the radar altimeter. [...] The descent rate at touch down was 18–20ft/s.|$|R
5|$|French {{casualties}} in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiantes destruction, but based on Acklom's report from the boarding party they {{were believed to be}} heavy. British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux. The restriction of French movement along their own coastline had serious effects {{for the development of the}} French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Kulesza {{left his}} job soon afterwards; {{according}} to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame.</b> Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, {{at that time}} comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at {{what they saw as}} excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|E
5|$|McDougal was {{released}} {{at the end}} of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby Fountainbridge for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> for the murders on Hare.|$|E
40|$|We live in {{a society}} that is {{increasingly}} preoccupied with allocating blame: when something goes wrong someone must be to blame. Bringing together philosophical, psychological and sociological accounts <b>of</b> <b>blame,</b> this is <b>the</b> first detailed criminological account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>blame.</b> <b>The</b> authors present a novel study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal process <b>of</b> <b>blame</b> attribution, set in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> criminalisation as a social and political process...|$|R
50|$|Following {{claims made}} in the Canadian media about <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> UK for {{supplying}} an unsafe vessel, Hoon accompanied his condolences for Saunders stating that Canada as the buyer had to beware. In Canada, many World War II veterans were outraged by his comments, considering Canada's sacrifice for Britain during both World Wars.|$|R
50|$|Gay Men's Health Crisis {{received}} {{extensive coverage}} in Randy Shilts's 1987 book And the Band Played On. The book described <b>the</b> progress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pandemic <b>blaming</b> <b>the</b> government, especially the Reagan administration and Secretary of Health Margaret Heckler, {{for failing to}} respond. It praised GMHC for its work. Shilts was a gay man who later died of AIDS.|$|R
5|$|Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said {{immediately}} after the race that nine teams– all but Ferrari– agreed not to race, and had Jordan not reversed its decision at the last minute, Minardi would also have boycotted the race. In his later, lengthier, statement, he indicated that although it had been Michelin's failure to provide a reliable tyre which had initiated the events, he laid the full blame for the failure to reach some accommodation (which would have allowed a race to happen, {{for the benefit of}} the many fans who had paid considerable money for travel and tickets) at the feet of Max Mosley and the FIA, with a small share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> going to what he characterized as the obstructionist Ferrari team leader, Jean Todt. He furthermore called for Mosley's resignation.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{continued}} to impress militarily. By 1644, now the Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness, {{he led the}} relief of Newark and York and its castle. Having marched north, taking Bolton and Liverpool along the way in two bloody assaults, Rupert then intervened in Yorkshire in two highly effective manoeuvres, in the first outwitting the enemy forces at Newark with speed; in the second, striking across country and approaching York from the north. Rupert then commanded much of the royalist army at its defeat at Marston Moor, with much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> falling on the poor working relationship between Rupert and the Marquess of Newcastle, and orders from the King that wrongly conveyed a desperate need for a speedy success in the north.|$|E
5|$|The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the strike}} was repressed, various motives were {{ascribed}} to it. At the time, the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) was in power; D.R. Ioanițescu, President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Deputies, <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> extreme poverty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underpaid workers and [...] "possibly" [...] Hungarian propagandists. (A majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead were ethnic Hungarians.) Another member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> mine directors; he alleged that <b>the</b> repeated refusals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bosses {{to yield to}} the workers' demands and their dismissive assertions that they were led on by provocateurs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banned Romanian Communist Party had driven them to desperation. Notably, {{this was not an}} isolated incident; nineteen strikes had taken place in the Valley between 1924 and 1928.|$|R
5|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who praised <b>the</b> actors' portrayal <b>of</b> their respective characters but found the film underwhelming. A few organisations fighting for <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tragedy <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> film for presenting {{the facts in}} a distorted manner. Kumar and Sheen denied these allegations. The Madhya Pradesh government exempted the film from paying tax.|$|R
