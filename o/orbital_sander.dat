50|$|Random orbit sanders are {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} for sanding {{in which the}} sanding blade delivers a random-orbit action. That is, the angle of rotation {{of the head and}} disk is variable. Perhaps the first introduced in 1976 by Festool but in 1982, random orbit sanders combine the speed and aggressiveness (again by Festool, Festo in 1982) of a belt sander with the ability to produce a finer finish than that available from a standard, slow speed <b>orbital</b> finishing <b>sander.</b> Random <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders</b> generally come in three different types: electric powered, air powered, and <b>orbital</b> floor <b>sanders.</b> The electric and air powered <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders</b> are handheld, while the floor <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders</b> are large machines that roll.|$|R
50|$|Coated {{abrasives}} may {{be shaped}} {{for use in}} rotary and <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders,</b> for wrapping around sanding blocks, as handpads, as closed loops for use on belt grinders, as striking surfaces on matchboxes, on diamond plates and diamond steels. Diamond tools, though for cutting, are often abrasive in nature.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, many {{attachments}} could commonly {{be purchased}} to convert corded electric hand drills into a range of other power tools, such as <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders</b> and power saws, more cheaply than purchasing conventional, self-contained versions of those tools (the greatest saving being {{the lack of an}} additional electric motor for each device). As the prices of power tools and suitable electric motors have fallen, however, such attachments have become much less common. A similar practice is currently employed for cordless tools where the battery, the most expensive component, is shared between various motorised devices, as opposed to a single electric motor being shared between mechanical attachments.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Pentair, Inc. {{acquired}} Rockwell's {{power tool}} group—consisting of Porter-Cable and Delta Machinery—and restored the Porter-Cable name. The company repositioned {{itself as a}} manufacturer of professional power tools and ended production of consumer-level tools. In 1989, the company introduced the first electric random <b>orbital</b> <b>sander.</b> Around this time, the company expanded into broader retail channels, including The Home Depot and Lowe's, greatly expanding its production in the process.|$|E
50|$|Festool is a {{brand of}} power tools from Germany. Festool Group GmbH & Co. KG is based in Wendlingen and is a {{subsidiary}} of the TTS Tooltechnic Systems holding company. The company was founded by Gottlieb Stoll and Albert Fezer in 1925 under the name Fezer & Stoll and then later became Festo. Innovations included the first gasoline powered portable chainsaw , the <b>orbital</b> <b>sander,</b> the portable circular saw with guide rail (called a track saw), and the Domino joiner. In 2000, its portable power tool activities were spun off into an independent company, Festool.|$|E
40|$|Workers in wood {{industry}} {{are exposed to}} vibration and its damages. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate exposure to hand-arm and whole body vibration in the {{wood industry}}. In this study, the parameters of whole body and hand-arm vibrations such as effective acceleration, overall equivalent acceleration, Vibration Dose Value and crest factor were studied on two Thicknessing planes, two sliding panel saw machines, two <b>orbital</b> <b>sander,</b> and three operators of perforate procedure. Assessments were done by the use of an oscillator and an analyzer of Svantak Co. Evaluating Hand-arm and whole body vibrations were conducted based on ISO 5349 - 1, ISO 5349 - 2 and ISO 2631 - 1 standards, respectively, and the findings/ the evaluated data were analyzed. The mean amount of daily exposure to hand-arm vibration (RMS) in Thicknessing plane, <b>Orbital</b> <b>Sander</b> and Sliding panel saw machine operators are respectively 5. 56, 5. 49 and 3. 37 m/s 2. In addition, the average crest factor of the 3 jobs is higher than 6. Mean of daily Exposure to whole body vibration in 3 machine operators of Thicknessing plane, perforate procedure and Sliding panel saw is respectively, 0. 28, 0. 24 and 0. 17 meters per square second. The crest factor for all the exposures was to be less than 6 and the mean of the calculated daily vibration dose equaled 5. 83 with the standard deviation of 0. 87 (m) ⁄s^ 1. 75. In further measured situations, exposure to hand-arm vibration is more than the standard level, so engineering and management measures are required to reduce the amount of exposure and support the health of the operators and the equipment...|$|E
5000|$|Violence is a satire of {{conventional}} dungeon-bashing games, {{set in a}} contemporary metropolis where player characters dash {{from room to room}} killing the occupants and stealing their belongings. In a style reminiscent of Mad, it is relentlessly user-hostile, taking time out to insult the reader wherever possible (it opens with the words, [...] "Welcome to Violence, you degraded turd") and uses a system where the user can buy experience points for cash from the designer or publisher. Despite innovative game design and exhaustive lists of equipment and weapons (including both belt and <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders),</b> monster types and possible scenarios, it is largely and deliberately unplayable because of an exhaustive rule-set. The rule-set provides information on a range of things related to killing. Weapons, combat styles, and the like are intricately detailed, considering the short length of the volume. Violence is a rant against the traditional styles of Dungeons & Dragons, MMORPGs, and the Grand Theft Auto series, written to simultaneously annoy, enrage and challenge the reader. As a game, it is of little value, but is useful as an insight into the mindset of its author and an indictment of an endemic style of role-playing.|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} at {{the workplace}} are often complicated and expensive. The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the manufacturer s information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350. By taking the example of masonry and stone working machines, the empirically determined tool-related correction factor is checked and confirmed. Methods Vibration measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 5349 in practical application conditions on 10 selected typical eccentric and <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders,</b> concrete and disc grinders as well as on wall chasers and stone saws. Results The total vibration value obtained for the investigated tools rangedfrom ahv = 3. 6 m/s to ahv = 11. 6 m/s. When the values from the practical measurements are compared with the manufacturer s vibration values, the underestimation of the risk occurring in some cases can be largely compensated for by the tool-related factors conforming to CEN/TR 15350 (see Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb {{in a group of}} female workers performing either mechanical or hand sanding in the furniture industry (n= 100) and in a control group of female office workers (n= 100). A further aim was to study the possible adverse effects of exposure to a combination of vibration and ergonomic risk factors in female workers. Methods: All female workers underwent a medical interview and a complete physical investigation. The clinical diagnoses of Raynaud’s phenomenon and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were made according to international consensus criteria. Hand-transmitted vibration from <b>orbital</b> <b>sanders</b> was measured according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommendations. Daily vibration exposure was assessed in terms of 8 -h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration [A(8) ] according to the European Directive on physical agents. Ergonomic load on the upper limbs was estimated by means of strain index methodology. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon between the furniture workers (4 %) and the controls (8 %). The prevalence of CTS, peripheral sensorineural disturbances (after exclusion of CTS cases) and upper-limb musculoskeletal complaints was significantly greater in the furniture workers than in the controls. CTS was clinically diagnosed in 19 % of the furniture workers and 8 % of the controls. A log-binomial regression analysis showed that the occurrence of soft-tissue disorders of the upper limb increased significantly with the increase of both daily vibration exposure and the strain index score. It was estimated that the risk for CTS increased by a factor of 1. 30 (95 % CI 1. 11 – 1. 53) for each unit of increase in A(8) (ms 2), and by 1. 09 (95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 15) for each unit of increase in the strain index score. Conclusions: Even though the cross-sectional design of this epidemiological study does not allow aetiological considerations, our findings suggest a significant association between occupational use of vibratory tools and soft-tissue disorders in the upper limbs of female workers. Quantitative estimation of vibration exposure and ergonomic stress showed that these physical risk factors seem to contribute in a multiplicative way to the occurrence of chronic nerve and musculoskeletal disorders in female workers operating hand-held vibrating tools in the furniture industry...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this analysis {{is to find out}} the effect of hand held power tools on hand arm and reducing the effects of these hand held power tools on hand arm of the operator. Three different power hand held tools a Jigsaw, a Planer and a Random <b>orbital</b> <b>sander</b> were used for analysing the effects on hand arm. Two measurement tools were used a Fingertip tactile pressure sensor for measuring the forces acting on the hand arm and A Tri-axial accelerometer for measuring the vibration caused by these tools in hand arm. To reduce the effects of the hand held tools on hand arm of the operator different coatings on the handle of hand-held power tools including one handle uncoated will be used and then the measurements of vibration and force obtained from these coated handle is then compared with the uncoated handl...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} sanding {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in a large dust tunnel, using an <b>orbital</b> <b>sander</b> with an aluminum oxide abrasive of 150 grit size, on twelve different hardwood species. Dust concentration measurements were taken using gravimetric isokinetic air-quality samplers. A field survey of 25 wooden furniture-manufacturing mills to ascertain the dust exposure levels at the sanding sections and also evaluate the labor productivity losses encountered among workers {{as a result of}} dust exposure. The results found that dust emission in the sanding process was primarily determined by the amount of wood removed. Further, the dust exposure levels at the sanding section in the furniture-manufacturing mills were above the standard 5 mg m - 3 level and hence, control of dust emission and the use of dust protection gears by the workers must be enforced in the furniture-manufacturing mills to ensure {{the health and safety of}} the workers. Without such measures, labor productivity among the workers would be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 While {{anti-vibration}} gloves are widespread {{as a form}} of reducing employee exposure to hand-arm vibration (HAV) there is concern about how effective they actually are in a real manufacturing environment with specific tools. Currently ISO 10819 is used to certify gloves as "anti-vibration"; however, the standard only tests a static position and force which may not accurately represent a gloves ability to reduce vibration exposure during specific tasks. The aims of this study are to examine 4 different types of gloves and see how effective they are at reducing vibration exposure in employees performing a specific workplace task. The first hypothesis tested {{is whether or not the}} gloves are different from the bare hand measurements. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in vibration exposure when a glove is used. The second hypothesis evaluated is whether a difference can be observed between the gloves themselves. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the gloves. To determine the validity these two hypotheses, vibration exposure during a sanding task will be examined. The third hypothesis tested is whether the subjects' perception of vibration reduction with the gloves matches the actual measured results. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between subject perception and the measured results. This was done with a questionnaire given to the subjects asking them to rate the perceived vibration and rank the gloves in order of most effective to least. A jitterbug-style <b>orbital</b> <b>sander</b> was mounted with a tri-axial accelerometer while the subject had another tri-axial accelerometer attached to the back of their hand and both were connected to the same data logger so that simultaneous measurements of both accelerometers could be taken. In a randomly assigned order the subject used each of the four gloves to take one minute samples from sanding both a vertical and a horizontal surface. The same was done for a barehanded measurement where the subject used no glove, also randomly assigned in the order. A ratio from the tool and hand samples was found for each glove to find the transmissibility factor. The gloved transmissibility factors were then compared to that subject's bare hand sample to find the corrected transmissibility of the glove. The results differed depending on which surface was used. On the horizontal surface there was not a significant difference between the gloves and the bare hand, but if the sample size would have been larger then there likely would have been. There was a significant difference between gloves; one of the gloves was found to amplify vibration exposure. On the vertical surface there was no difference between the gloves and the bare hand or between the gloves themselves. The subject rankings of the gloves did not closely resemble the actual results. According to this study, ISO 10819 may not accurately depict a glove's ability to mitigate vibration for specific tasks. The use of {{anti-vibration gloves}} may also be an ineffective way to try to reduce employee exposure to high levels of vibration...|$|E
