The Wesleyan Chapel Methodist Church has been the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> of worship since 1882 and closed in September 2013. The manufacturer of Foden Trucks and their award-winning Fodens Motor Works Band, were based in Bradwall until a boundary change in 1936 placed them in the adjacent parish of Sandbach.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> {{in hundreds of}} miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E

5|$|Jersey is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in the British Isles {{where the}} agile frog Rana dalmatina is found.

5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores {{fueled the}} demand for detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1950, this modern, Roman Catholic {{church is}} located at Millway, and is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> of worship in the suburb. It was also a social hub, hosting regular events such as Christmas fayres. In 2009 however, parish priest David Taylor was arrested in {{connection}} with a number of indecent assaults on young boys in his care and was suspended from his joint parish of St Peter's, Low Fell and the Annunciation. Taylor admitted five charges at Durham Crown Court in 2009 and was given a prison sentence. On 20 April 2012, a final mass was held by the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle and the church was closed. As of 2012 the building remains standing, although property company GVA are inviting tenders for the church and adjoining land.|$|E
5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> where life is known to exist.

It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E
