40|$|Whereas some {{central bank}} {{derivatives}} and <b>other</b> <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> arise from anomalous circumstances, {{there are a}} number of positive reasons that explain their popularity. After analyzing the rationale for these operations, we stress that most of these operations, being off-balance sheet, increase the risk and reduce the transparency of central bank accounts. This in turn makes more difficult the assessment of the financial position of the monetary authority and, by implication, of the macroeconomic conditions of the country. To deal with this issue, we suggest a comprehensive portfolio approach that values, in an economic sense, all assets and liabilities of the central bank. ...|$|E
40|$|Where {{large-scale}} {{investments are}} needed, especially for infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been touted as an option. With encouragement {{by the international}} financial institutions, PPPs have been promoted in developing countries, especially those facing large public sector debt burdens. PPPs can be very diverse and complex. Many developing country governments lack the institutional and human resource capacity to handle the complexities of PPPs, and hence, PPPs may not yield the results promised. Complex financial contracts, involving commitments to future payments, often reduce transparency. Thus, PPPs can suffer similar problems – such as corruption, cronyism, monopolies – faced in privatization. The transfer of risks to private contractors may be partial, with the government having to step in if something goes wrong. A further consideration is to ensure equitable access for poor and low income households to maintain political support for PPPs. Even when PPP contracts take investments off government balance sheets, and thereby seemingly improve the fiscal balance, commitments to pay for future service flows and <b>other</b> <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> have similar economic effects to public debt. PPPs do not necessarily entail lower capital costs than investments financed by public borrowing. Public-private partnership, public debt, privatization, developing countries...|$|E

40|$|The sale of {{an entity}} as a going concern {{has a number}} of tax {{consequences}} for both the purchaser and the seller. The tax deductibility of a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> upon its transfer from the seller to the purchaser, where the selling price has been reduced by the value of the <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> transferred, remains uncertain following the decision in Ackermans Ltd v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service. An expense is either deductible under a specific section of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, or under the general expense provisions in terms of sections 11 (a) and 23 (g). The Act does not contain a specific section relating to <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> and therefore a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> will need to be considered for deduction under these sections. The Act further disallows an expense as a deduction under section 23 (e), where a reserve is created (for example a leave pay provision). This study analyses the tax deductibility of a <b>contingent</b> <b>liability,</b> where the <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> has been transferred from the seller to the purchaser in a sale of an entity as a going concern and the purchase price has been reduced to compensate for the transfer of the <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> The deductibility of the <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> was first assessed in terms of the provisions of the Act (sections 11 (a), 23 (g) and 23 (e)) and associated case law.

40|$|How {{should the}} <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a {{sovereign}} {{be treated in}} a general restructuring of the debts of that sovereign? This question has played only a minor role in past sovereign debt restructurings because the size of such <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> has in most cases been small. In recent years, however, slathering government guarantees on third party debt has become the tool of choice for many countries {{in their efforts to}} quell an incipient panic in their financial markets. Some of those sovereigns are now, or may soon be, in the position of needing to restructure their debts. Ignoring large <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> in a sovereign debt restructuring may plant a land mine on the road to debt sustainability once the restructuring closes. That said, the answers to the questions of whether and how to restructure <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> are not obvious. Is the restructurer to assume that some, all or none of those <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> will eventually wind up as direct claims against the sovereign? Even if the underlying instrument can be successfully restructured, the guarantee will typically stand as an independent obligation of the guarantor that will require separate treatment in the restructuring...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyze the effects of {{strategic}} bankruptcy and <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> footnote disclosure (as required by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5) on the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The results of the study indicate the following: (1) Because strategic bankruptcies have been used as a business strategy to accomplish a corporate goal, when strategic bankruptcies are grouped with financial bankruptcies, noise is created. Partitioning bankrupt firms into strategic and financial bankrupt firms cleans the noise and improves the accuracy of the bankruptcy prediction models. (2) The Type I error rate and accuracy of the model improved significantly with the inclusion of <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> variables. A proxy for the accrual of <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> included in the financial statements is not a good discriminator of bankrupt and nonbankrupt firms. A proxy for text length of the <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> footnote disclosure is statistically significant and should be considered in bankruptcy prediction models. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{control the}} {{expansion}} of government <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> and reduce fiscal vulnerability, one {{must be able to}} identify and measure them. The authors discuss how this may be done and demonstrate how the assessment of fiscal adjustment may change substantially when a broader picture of government liabilities is included. They base their analysis on experience in analyzing fiscal adjustment in the Czech Republic and Macedonia. Their work demonstrates the importance of including <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> when analyzing fiscal sustainability. To the extent that explicit expenditures are shifted off-budget or replaced by guarantees, the achieved improvement in fiscal balances is overstated. For the Czech Republic, adjustment may have been overstated by some 3 to 4 percent of annual GDP. A stabilization program accompanied by a build-up of <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities,</b> particularly state guarantees and obligations to cover liabilities emerging from directed credit, may not be sustainable. In Macedonia, the present fiscal equilibrium may be temporary because the stock of existing <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> could add 2 to 4 percent of GDP to future deficits. And methods used to reduce the"traditional"deficit are unlikely to be sustainable without further modification. The authors conclude that governments: 1) must find better ways to identify and evaluate <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> arising from the banking system, nonbanking financial institutions, public enterprises, or the <b>contingent</b> and direct <b>liabilities</b> of subnational governments; 2) need to better manage their risks [...] for example, building adequate reserve funds and hedging risk, where possible; and 3) should examine the implications of the bias toward adding <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> and develop administrative reform as part of analyzing budget management.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} how the Banking Acts of the 1933 and 1935 and related New Deal legislation influenced risk {{taking in the}} financial sector of the U. S. economy.

Using a new panel data set, we find <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> reduced risk taking. In states with <b>contingent</b> <b>liability,</b> banks used less leverage and converted each dollar of capital into fewer loans, and thus could survive larger loan losses (as a fraction of their portfolio) than banks in limited liability states. In states with limited liability, banks took on more leverage and risk, particularly in states that required banks with limited liability to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the long run, the New Deal replaced a regime of <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> with deposit insurance, stricter balance sheet regulation, and increased capital requirements, shifting the onus of risk management from bankers to state and federal regulators...|$|R
40|$|The <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> of a sovereign, such as {{guarantees}} of the debts of third parties, can normally be kept off {{the balance sheet}} of the sovereign guarantor. That is their charm. As the debt to GDP ratios of many developed countries approach red-zone levels, <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> are increasingly being favored over direct, on-the-balance-sheet, borrowings. But what happens if a country carrying large <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> needs to restructure its debt? The borrower dare not leave its contingent claims out of the restructuring. To do so would risk undermining the financial predicates of the sovereign’s economic recovery program should the beneficiaries of the guarantees demand payment in full after the restructuring closes. Attempting to shoehorn sovereign <b>contingent</b> <b>liabilities</b> into a debt restructuring, however, is a particularly challenging task. There are few precedents for how to do so, and no good precedents. The explosion {{in the size of}} contingent sovereign obligations since the financial crisis began in 2008 inevitably means that these issues will need to be confronted sooner or later, probably sooner...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} argued that banks hold an {{insufficient}} amount of capital. Put differently, banks issue too much debt relative to equity. This claim is particularly important because, all else equal, lower levels of capital put banks at greater risk of insolvency. As a result, some have advocated imposing capital requirements on banks. However, even if one accepts the proposition that banks hold too little capital, it does not necessarily follow that the correct policy response is to force banks to hold more capital. An alternative to higher capital requirements is a system in which banks have <b>contingent</b> <b>liability.</b> Under <b>contingent</b> <b>liability,</b> shareholders are liable for at least some portion of depositor losses. This alternative is not unprecedented. Historical evidence from the United States and elsewhere suggest that banks with <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> have more desirable characteristics than those with limited liability and that depositors tend to prefer <b>contingent</b> <b>liability</b> when given the choice.
