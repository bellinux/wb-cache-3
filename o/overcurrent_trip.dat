50|$|A metal {{rectifier}} {{is an early}} type of semiconductor rectifier in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium. They were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers. Westinghouse Electric (1886) was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers, under the trade name Westector (now used as a trade name for an <b>overcurrent</b> <b>trip</b> device by Westinghouse Nuclear).|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{revolves around}} a time dependent thermal overload trip unit inside automated switching mechanisms. The first part addresses {{the principle of}} the function of a thermal <b>overcurrent</b> <b>trip</b> unit and the possible construction solutions. The biggest emphasis is given to bimetal as a base construction feature of the thermal <b>overcurrent</b> <b>trip</b> unit. Besides the materials that are most suitable for the creation of bimetal, various bimetal parameters that are needed for its design are also analyzed. The next subject of the thesis is an introduction to the elemental calculations for the bimetal component and the summary of mathematical relations for the calculation of the most commonly used solutions. A predominant part of this thesis revolves around the theoretical calculation of the thermal overload trip in a previously estabilished circuit breaker for a specific type of the bimetal and a specific required tripping characteristic. The previously estabilished calculation is then verified by measuring. The measuring itself consists of the measurement of the free bending of the bimetal in dependence on heat. The last part of this thesis includes the assessment of the results calculated from the theoretical standpoint, compared with the results given by the measurement...|$|E
40|$|Right {{function}} of securing electrical installations {{is one of}} the most important factors preventing people, animals and electrical devices themselves from being electrocuted. Circuit breakers with an <b>overcurrent</b> <b>tripping</b> unit work with bimetal. When the bimetal is warmed up enough, it causes disconnection of circuit. This prevents people and animals from being harmed. To make <b>overcurrent</b> <b>tripping</b> unit work the right way, we have to minimise unnecessary disfunction factors caused by thermal thaw and Joule´s heat. This thesis is aimed at gaining general knowledge of heat transmission and transition of electrical current into heat. There are going to be made temperature-rise curves using all available connection sets to evaluate the impact of each one on the tripping unit. Then, a temperature profile of the circuit breaker will be made using a simulation made using SoildWorks Flow Simulation program. Finally, critical places of the current path will be observed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} smart battery {{charging}} strategy for Electric Vehicles (EVs) targeting the future smart homes. The proposed strategy consists in regulate the EV battery charging current in {{function of the}} total home current, aiming to prevent <b>overcurrent</b> <b>trips</b> in the main switch breaker. Computational and experimental results were obtained under real-time conditions to validate the proposed strategy. For such purpose was adapted a bidirectional EV battery charger prototype to operate {{in accordance with the}} aforementioned strategy. The proposed strategy was validated through experimental results obtained both in steady and transient states.

30|$|Motivated by the {{aforementioned}} issues, a flexible unbalanced control strategy for VSG is comprehensively studied in this paper. The proposed flexible control strategy is cascaded with novel current reference generator (CRG) and power reference generator (PRG) {{together with the}} basic VSG controller and a double sequence frame current regulator, which can flexibly meet different operation requirements under varying voltage conditions. The control strategy is advantageous in twofold: ① current reference generator is an essential module to achieve different unbalanced control objectives, which manages to either balance three phase currents, or provide constant active or reactive power; ② power reference generator with peak current limitation is another important module, which can make full utilization of the maximum current to provide power supports and avoid <b>overcurrent</b> <b>tripping</b> or device damage.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmbient air {{temperatures}} {{are expected to}} increase in the US desert southwest by 1 - 5 °C mid-century which will strain the electric power grid through increased loads, reduced power capacities, efficiencies, and material lifespans. To better understand and quantify this risk, a power infrastructure failure model is created to estimate changes in outage rates of components for increases in air temperatures in Arizona. Components analyzed include generation, transmission lines, and substations, because their outages can lead to cascading failures and interruptions of other critical infrastructure systems such as water, transportation, and information/communication technology. Preliminary results indicate that components could require maintenance or replacement up to 3 times more often due to mechanical failures, outages could occur up to 30 times more often due to <b>overcurrent</b> <b>tripping,</b> and the probability of cascading failures could increase 30 times as well for a 1 °C increase in ambient air temperature. Preventative measures can include infrastructure upgrades to more thermal resistant parts, installation of cooling systems, smart grid power flow controls, and expanding programs for demand side management and customer energy efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Arcing {{can also}} occur when a low {{resistance}} channel (foreign object, conductive dust, moisture...) forms between places with different voltage. The conductive channel then can facilitate {{formation of an}} electric arc. The ionized air has high electrical conductivity approaching that of metals, and it can conduct extremely high currents, causing a short circuit and tripping protective devices (fuses and circuit breakers). A similar situation may occur when a lightbulb burns out and the fragments of the filament pull an electric arc between the leads inside the bulb, leading to <b>overcurrent</b> that <b>trips</b> the breakers.|$|R
50|$|The Rectiverter module {{contains}} an AC/AC connection which {{eliminates the need}} for a separate centralized static bypass switch. In addition, the AC output port is designed for supplying an <b>overcurrent</b> pulse for <b>tripping</b> Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs) and clear short circuit currents. The advantages of the bypass switch are maintained while the single point of failure is eliminated.|$|R
50|$|This starter {{includes}} a no-voltage magnetic holding feature, which causes the rheostat to spring to the off position if power is lost, {{so that the}} motor does not later attempt to restart in the full-voltage position. It also has <b>overcurrent</b> protection that <b>trips</b> the lever to the off position if excessive current over a set amount is detected.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the system}} voltage is high enough, an {{electric}} arc may form between power system conductors and ground. Such an arc {{can have a}} relatively high impedance (compared to the normal operating levels of the system) and {{can be difficult to}} detect by simple overcurrent protection. For example, an arc of several hundred amperes on a circuit normally carrying a thousand amperes may not <b>trip</b> <b>overcurrent</b> circuit breakers but can do enormous damage to bus bars or cables before it becomes a complete short circuit. Utility, industrial, and commercial power systems have additional protection devices to detect relatively small but undesired currents escaping to ground. In residential wiring, electrical regulations may now require Arc-fault circuit interrupters on building wiring circuits, to detect small arcs before they cause damage or a fire.|$|R
40|$|Voltage-sourced {{converter}} (VSC) -based static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) {{are used}} for voltage regulation in transmission and distribution systems. Unlike PWM-controlled STATCOMs, angle-controlled STATCOMs are switched at line frequency to limit the system losses. In recent years, angle-controlled STATCOMs have been deployed by utilities {{for the purpose of}} transmission system voltage regulation, voltage stability improvement, and increasing operational functionality. Despite the superior feature on voltage waveform quality and efficiency, the practical angle-controlled STATCOMs suffer from the <b>overcurrent</b> (and <b>trips)</b> and possible saturation of the interfacing transformers caused by negative sequence current during unbalanced conditions and faults in the utility. This paper specifically proposes a control structure to improve the angle-controlled STATCOMs performance under unbalanced conditions and faults. The main improvement is a substantial decrease in the negative sequence current and dc-link voltage oscillations under power system faults by the proposed control. This eliminates the need to redesign the STACOM power components to operate under fault current and dc-link voltage oscillations. The proposed control structure is designed based on adding appropriate oscillations to the conventional angle-controller output that is the control angle by which the VSC voltage vector leads/lags the line voltage vector. Since this control structure uses two angles for controlling the VSC output voltage, it is called dual angle control (DAC). PSCAD/EMTDC and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed control structure under unbalanced system conditions and faults. The experiments were conducted on a transient network analyzer, a unique hardware-based flexible ac transmission system simulator which was designed to study system faults and transients for a 2 x 100 MVA STATCOM field installation...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. systems has failed to detect arcing faults numerous times with disastrous consequences. The fault leaves a charred furrow, known as the ''arc track'', through Kapton cable insulation. Tests by NASA and others have confirmed that the average circuit current during an arc tracking fault remains below <b>overcurrent</b> protection <b>trip</b> levels. Some in the field believe the reduction of fault current is due to the carbonized insulation, presumably, acting as a resistive element in the fault branch. It is thought that insulations which do not carbonize when exposed to an arc will eliminate the arc tracking problem. This thesis supports an alternative theory that the voltage drop of the arc itself may be solely responsible for reducing the fault current and the ''track'' is collateral damage from the arc. The voltage-current (V-l) characteristic of arcs below 50 amps was left unresolved, by research concluded in the 192 O's. Recently, interest has returned to low current AC arcing, but the focus has been on the harmonics generated by such arcs as a means of detection. This thesis proposes a static V-I characteristic for a low current DC arcs supported by theory and empirical data. Two different experiments and a total of twenty four trials were made of DC arcs on bare I 8 AWG solid copper electrodes in geometries simulating Sow current arcs, between wires of a typical cable bundle (1 - 6 amps and 12 - 125 mils long). Using multiple linear regression the data was fitted to 18 different models, new or proposed in the literature. Evaluated using the F-statistic, the best model, with a standard error of less than 3 V, was a voltage source, opposed to the system voltage, dependent only on arc length. Current only influenced arc lifetime. Varc=l 3 v+l 68 v/inch*arc length This model agreed with low current (< 1 A) zero length sparks and a 55 miI, 60 amp peak AC arc. It does not agree with the high current model developed from long AC arcs: Varc= 37 v/inch*arc length. The arc voltage between thin wall (7 mil) wire is predicted to be 15. 5 V, which, in a 28 V power system, would reduce the bolted fault current by 55 %, regardless of the insulation type...|$|R

40|$|Intentional {{islanding}} {{of electrical}} distribution systems raises potentials for customer {{backup power supply}} in future energy systems. An uncertain amount of additional expenses is needed to ensure an adequate and reliable protection system for the islanded mode of operation. Nowadays, customer installations are mainly equipped with low-cost overcurrent protection devices. Their reliable fault tripping is assumed but is not verified in intentionally islanded grids built by multiple inverter coupled distributed energy resources. It is unknown, whether critical influences and requirements {{need to be taken}} into consideration in addition to a sufficient dimensioning of the sources. Potentially influencing factors are investigated by means of time domain simulations of an islanded low voltage distribution system containing two grid building inverters. One and three phased faults are investigated in main and final circuits of customer installations. A sensitivity analysis varies up to 32 factors simultaneously from the areas grid structure and parameters, dimensioning of inverters, inverter neutral current injection capability as well as structure and parameters of LCL-filters, control circuits, current limiting mechanisms and anti-windup. For the first time, these variation studies consider an increasing degree of inhomogeneity of structure and parameter settings and exploit a significant bandwidth of values per setting. A rule based procedure is created as a precondition for parameterizing the overall model and the control circuits. Adequate variants of inverter current reference limiting mechanisms are identified by means of a developed test procedure. For the first time, according mechanisms are systematically derived for grid building inverters with neutral current injection capability. Reliable <b>tripping</b> of <b>overcurrent</b> protection devices is achievable for single wire final circuits with tripping times lower than 400 ms, when a successful fault ride through can be ensured for an adequate quantity of grid building inverters. The required installed rated inverter currents are in the range from 0. 92 to 1. 18 times the <b>overcurrent</b> protection device’s <b>tripping</b> current. Influencing factors are the current limiting mechanisms used, the type of overcurrent protection installed and the inhomogeneity of inverter control structures present. Faults in main circuits experience a critical influence by a loss of transient stability during the fault (desynchronization) due to the resulting longer prospective tripping times. A reliable protection tripping is then impeded by the resulting gradual or cyclic reduction of the total fault current available. In case of three phased faults, the development over time can be estimated by a small number of factors. For one phased faults, an increase of the number of desynchronizing cases is observed with increasing degree of structural inhomogeneity. Dependable tripping is potentially achievable, when mechanisms for reliably avoiding desynchronization are utilized. In that case, an adequate number of inverters must ride through the fault. A fault ride through capability of the grid building inverters requires those to supply and tolerate phase voltages in the range of zero to 1. 08 *sqrt(3) p. u. and line-line voltages up to 1. 175 p. u. Partial loading and reverse power capabilities are required from the inverter coupled distributed energy resources. Cyclic overloading of single phases or complete inverters can occur especially in case of a desynchronization...|$|R
