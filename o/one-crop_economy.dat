2500|$|Cuba had a <b>one-crop</b> <b>economy</b> (sugar cane) whose {{domestic}} market was constricted. Its population {{was characterized by}} chronic unemployment and deep poverty. United States monopolies like Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Speyer gained control over valuable national resources. The banks and the country's entire financial system, all electric power production {{and the majority of}} industry was dominated by US companies. US monopolies owned 25 percent of the best land in Cuba. More than 80 percent of farmland was owned by sugar and livestock-raising large landowners. 90 percent of the country's raw sugar and tobacco exports was exported to the US. In 1956, U.S. owned companies controlled [...] "90 percent of the telephone and electric services, about 50 percent in public service railways, and roughly 40 percent in raw sugar production" [...] according to a report published by the Department of Commerce [...] The gains from these investments were reaped by American businessmen leading to discontent among the Cuban people.|$|E
50|$|The South {{continued}} to be a <b>one-crop</b> <b>economy</b> until the 20th century, when the New Deal and World War II encouraged diversification. Many ex-slaves as well as poor whites worked in the sharecropping system in serf-like conditions.|$|E
50|$|Yet until 1940, with a {{population}} of 37,000 (13.2 percent black), the county remained primarily rural and agricultural. Like many other Piedmont counties, Pickens had a <b>one-crop</b> <b>economy.</b> Its citizens were engaged mainly in growing cotton or manufacturing it into cloth. A notable change in the Pickens landscape was the coming of paved highways; one completed across the county, about 1930, ran from Greenville to Walhalla by way of Easley, Liberty, and Central.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War I, [...] "extension agents" [...] {{began to}} play a very {{important}} role in northeast Georgia. These people, as a group, supported the end of the <b>one-crop</b> (cotton) <b>economy.</b> Throughout the state they began to educate farmers in crop diversification so that if one crop failed income from other crops could support the family. In Gwinnett, Cherokee and Hall counties, farmers increased production of dairy products. The peach crop in Bartow County was expanded. In Habersham and Gilmer counties farmers increased production of apples and peaches.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the risks}} {{associated}} with a <b>one-crop</b> <b>economy</b> as well as from considerations of food security for the population, Uzbekistan has been moving to diversify its production into cereals, while reducing cotton production. Thus, the area sown to cotton was reduced from 1.8 million hectares in 1990 to 1.4 million hectares in 2006, while the area under cereals increased from 1.0 million to 1.6 million hectares (in part at the expense of areas allocated to feed crops). Another cause behind moves to diversify may be environmental, because the large quantities of irrigation and fertilization needed to produce cotton have contributed to the drying up of the Aral Sea and to the severe pollution of the soil in the surrounding areas.|$|E

50|$|Cotton is Uzbekistan's main cash crop, {{accounting}} for 17% of its exports in 2006. With annual cotton production of about 1 million ton of fiber (4%-5% of world production) and exports of 700,000-800,000 tons (10% of world exports), Uzbekistan is the 6th largest producer and the 2nd {{largest exporter of}} cotton in the world.
