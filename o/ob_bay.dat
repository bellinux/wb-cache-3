50|$|The Gulf of Ob (also {{known as}} <b>Ob</b> <b>Bay)</b> (О́бская губа́, Obskaya guba) is a bay of the Arctic Ocean, located in Northern Russia {{at the mouth}} of the Ob River. It is the world's longest estuary.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship has}} since been used for oil {{transportation}} in the Arctic Ocean. Along with her sister ship Indiga (ex-Lunni), sold to Russians at the same time, she {{has been involved in}} transporting oil from an oil terminal in the <b>Ob</b> <b>Bay</b> of the Kara Sea through the Kara Gates, the strait between Vaygach and Novaya Zemlya, to FSO Belokamenka in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea.|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of changes in}} the ecological situation and bottom topography in the <b>Ob</b> <b>Bay,</b> which may be caused by the construction of the approach channel to the port of Sabetta, was carried out {{with the help of the}} developed complex of numerical models. Particular attention was paid to the study of the displacement of the boundaries of the saline water expansion and the sediment accumulation in the channel area. It is established that the possible influence of the approach channel on the hydrologic-hydrochemical characteristics is less than their natural interannual and seasonal variability in the investigated water area. The change in the bottom topography after the construction of the approach channel does not entail a significant change in the regime of hydrologic-hydrochemical parameters of the <b>Ob</b> <b>Bay</b> and, consequently, should not affect the biocenosis. The calculated changes in the bottom topography in the approach channel area will not exceed 2 % of the depth per year and will not become a significant obstacle to the reliable and uninterrupted operation of the Sabetta port...|$|E
50|$|Other islets {{surrounding}} Rona include Na Gaimhnichean, Eilean na Seamraig, Garbh Eilean, Sgeirean Buidhe Borlum, and A' Sgeir Shuas. Eilean Tighe {{lies about}} 1 km away across the straits of An Caol Ronaigh at {{the centre of}} which is tiny Fraoich Eilean. The east coast is largely unindented {{and in addition to}} Acairseid Mhór the main bays are An Dubh-Chamus (black bay), An Acaarsaid Thioram (dry harbour) and Loch a' Bhràigheig on the west coast. There are several smaller bays in the north west including Port an Fhearainn, (port of the land), <b>Òb</b> nam Feusgan (<b>bay</b> of the mussel), Port na Bà Brice (port of the speckled cow) and <b>Òb</b> an Deallaire (<b>bay</b> of the loiterer). The highest point on the island is Meall na h-Acarseid, which reaches 125 m. Sgàth a' Bhannaich and Beinn na h-Iolaire (hill of the eagle) are further north and are over 100 m high.|$|R
5000|$|Munlochy ( [...] Scottish Gaelic: Poll Lochaidh) {{is a small}} village, in {{northern}} Scotland, lying {{at the head of}} Munlochy <b>Bay</b> (<b>Ob</b> Poll Lochaidh). There are few early records of a settlement, but it seems likely that Munlochy expanded in the 1760s due to quarry workers extracting stone nearby to build Fort George {{on the far side of}} the Moray Firth.|$|R
40|$|The Ob and Yenisei Rivers {{account for}} {{more than one-third of the}} total fresh water supply to the Arctic Ocean. In the past, their {{sediment}} load and particulate organic carbon (POC) discharge into the Kara Sea has been measured at stations in the hinterland far south of the estuaries. Suspended matter has been sampled in the estuaries and southern Kara Sea within the framework of the joint RussianGerman "SIRRO" program (Siberian River Run-Off), allowing a reliable new estimate of fluxes from the rivers into the Kara Sea. Our estimates of annual supplies of sediment (3. 76 x 10 ^ 6 t), particulate organic carbon(0. 27 x 10 ^ 6 t) and particulate nitrogen (PN) (0. 027 x 10 ^ 6 t) from the Ob River to the Kara Sea are lower than earlier estimates from the northernmost gauging station in the hinterland due to deposition of particulate matter in the <b>Ob</b> <b>Bay.</b> On the other hand, our estimates of the Yeniseis annual sediment (5. 03 x 10 ^ 6 t), particulate organic carbon (0. 57 x 10 ^ 6 t) and particulate nitrogen (0. 084 x 10 ^ 6 t) supplies to the Kara Sea are probably too high, as they suggest a pure bypass system in the investigated area. We differentiate between an area of recent deposition in the south of the Kara Sea and an area of recent organic matter degradation further north...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of the {{ice edge}} of (flaw lead) a large polynya in the River <b>Ob</b> <b>Bay</b> was {{investigated}} over the period 1997 – 2016 {{on the basis of}} satellite data. More than 800 satellite images were analyzed during the investigation. Relationship between the obtained time series of changing latitude {{of the ice}} edge and time series of air temperature, wind and indices of Wangenheim–Girs, the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was studied by means of the correlation analysis. The statistical analysis made it possible to reveal that southern position of the ice edge in autumn indicated to warmer winter months. Boundaries of the polynya during every next decade were identically determined by its position during the preceding period, and therewith the pronounced trend of the ice edge shift to south was noticed in 1997 – 2012. In addition, periodic fluctuations with two different periods were found against the background of trend. During 1996 – 2006 the fluctuations were quasi-biennial while after 2006 the period of fluctuations increased up to 4 – 5  years. Effort to predict the ice edge position aimed at determination of the polynya boundaries in January-February of 2016 was undertaken; data on the air temperature and latitude of the ice edge position for preceding period were used as the predictors. The difference between the prediction and actual data was equal to 0. 01  ÷ − 0. 43 of latitude with the average value for six decades equal to 0. 11 °. Analysis of inter-annual variability of the edge position indicated that the most close relationship took place with the Vangenheim–Girs index E in May (coefficient of correlation r = − 0. 73). Maximal values of r exceeding ± 0. 7 were calculated for the Arctic Oscillation indices in February with a positive shift of one year. When investigating long-term large-scale changes of climatic parameters, analysis of anomalies of average latitude values of the polynya southern boundary had been performed. This allowed to reveal that period of 2005 – 2006 was a point of inflection. This substantiates the known thesis (conclusion) that a well developed polynya exerts the warming effect on adjacent territories...|$|E
