5|$|Mr. Bean <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> {{unaware of}} basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E
5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have a life}} of its own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E

25|$|Street sign theft {{occurs when}} street signs are stolen, often {{to be used}} as decorations, but also {{sometimes}} to avoid obeying the law by claiming later the sign was not there. Although the theft <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> arbitrary, signs that are unusual or amusing tend to be stolen more frequently. Sometimes considered to be a prank by the perpetrators, the theft is often costly and inconveniencing for the municipality or agency that owns the sign. In the United States, each street sign generally costs between $100 and $500 to replace.|$|E
25|$|Stevan L. Davies {{argues that}} the {{apparent}} independence of the ordering of sayings in Thomas from that of their parallels in the synoptics shows that Thomas was not evidently reliant upon the canonical gospels and probably predated them. Several authors argue that when the logia in Thomas do have parallels in the synoptics, the version in Thomas <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> closer to the source. Theissen and Merz give sayings 31 and 65 as examples of this. Koester agrees, citing especially the parables contained in sayings 8, 9, 57, 63, 64 and 65. In the few instances where the version in Thomas seems {{to be dependent on}} the Synoptics, Koester suggests, {{this may be due to}} the influence of the person who translated the text from Greek into Coptic.|$|E
25|$|Georg Steinhauser, {{a chemist}} {{writing in the}} journal Medical Hypotheses, said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then {{end up in the}} navel {{at the end of the}} day. He further said that {{abdominal}} hair <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to grow in concentric circles around the navel; the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the belly button. Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing old clothes, which tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one-thousandth of their weight to the belly button over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with belly button rings particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.|$|E

25|$|The fashion {{industry}} is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public. In the world of fashion, it <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% “felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny”, with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin. Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models, while 46% will strive to achieve it. The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing “the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued”. For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.|$|E

500|$|Murray's {{disappearance}} {{has been}} cited as [...] "the first crime mystery of the social media age," [...] and generated speculation from {{the media and the}} public, specifically on the internet, in online forums and message boards. Writing for Boston in 2014, Bill Jensen noted: [...] "Now, at least online, it <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> as there’s {{no such thing as a}} cold case. But when Maura Murray disappeared, the social Web was in its infancy. There was no YouTube and no Twitter. On the day Maura went missing, Facebook was five days old. And so you can read the history of her case as a parable about the evolution of online sleuthing." [...] In November 2004, a second cousin of Murray created the website [...] [...] In 2005, active discussion of Murray's disappearance was documented on websleuths.com, and in 2007, Facebook and Myspace pages were created dedicated to helping find her.|$|E
500|$|From these chords, Copland builds {{an overall}} {{structure}} that he calls [...] "closest {{to a free}} treatment of the baroque form of the chaconne," [...] with a succession of variations [...] "based on the opening chords and their implied melodic intervals." [...] A series of variations alternate fast and slow sections, which according to Copland biographer Howard Pollack creates a complex structure overall. This structure forms a musical arch, sectioned ABCBA. Pollack calls the A sections [...] "prophetic, tragic," [...] the B sections [...] "jazzy, frentic [...] " [...] and the C section [...] "pastoral, reflective." [...] While these are all moods long familiar to listeners of Copland's music, Pollack asserts, [...] "a new darkness hangs over the whole. The outer sections are grave; the jazzy sections rather cheerless; the pastoral contrast more weary than peaceful. The music <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> lost, uncertain, trapped." [...] The piece ends {{in a series of}} strict 12-note chords that Copland called [...] "aggregates." ...|$|E
500|$|Unni R. Nair {{noted in}} his review for Kerala9.com, [...] "The care with which the script is done, the finesse with which the {{direction}} part is executed and the characterization and performance plus the thoughtful placing of the songs makes Drishyam worth real appreciation. That the film has almost zero-'filmy' humour is also worth noting. It's the logical {{manner in which the}} story unfolds and the very convincing manner in which the characters behave makes it impressive." [...] The critic rated the film three in a scale of five. IndiaGlitz's reviewer rated the film 8/10 and stated, [...] "Drishyam is undoubtedly cladded with exceptional story telling combined with bravura performances. An undoubtedly exceptional film as far the content is concerned, the movie is a must watch for all the audiences of family and thriller movies." [...] In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Scripted more or less in a convincing manner and mounted with finesse, writer-director Joseph fleshes out his characters. However, Drishyam <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> like a radio play, long dialogues mar its cinematic qualities, and like many other helmers, Joseph too does not know where to end his film. Cinema need not be so explanatory; certainly this is not how contemporary movies are made.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen gave the episode a B+, finding it [...] "endearingly batshit". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode was not entirely cohesive and that its ending was somewhat disappointing, but felt that overall the episode's imagery made up for this—summing up this idea by saying [...] "Millennium <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to be at its best when sense is a secondary consideration". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that its [...] "atmospheric elements do not quite {{add up to a}} cohesive whole". Gibron felt that this resulted in [...] "an episode that feels like the first half of a bad b-movie". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, awarded [...] "Beware of the Dog" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was so similar to The X-Files that it gave the impression that Millennium had [...] "lost its own identity". He found that the script contained [...] "enough wit in the dialogue" [...] but that its plot seemed too [...] "vague and elliptical". Writing for the Star Tribune, Bill Ward felt that the episode featured a [...] "lighter" [...] tone than usual, comparing it to The X-Files. Ward described the episode as taking [...] "some nice turns en route to an ambivalent semiresolution".|$|E
500|$|Particularly-negative reviews {{included}} that of The New York Times Elvis Mitchell, {{who said}} the film was [...] "second-rate and ordinary," [...] while Variety's Todd McCarthy considered it [...] "a pretender {{in the realm of}} bona-fide superheroes." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "C-", criticizing the story as [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "slipshod", saying, [...] "Daredevil is the sort of half-assed, visually-lackadaisical potboiler that makes you rue the day that comic-book franchises ever took over Hollywood." [...] Time Outs Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck, feeling he [...] "persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing," [...] but also felt writer/director Johnson's construction fails all involved in the film. Slates David Edelstein believed Johnson copied a lot of Batman, and concluded by saying [...] "that's not so bad: The movie looks best when it looks like other, better movies." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention, but felt it does not reward it. The New York Posts Lou Lumenick panned the film, describing it as a [...] "mind-numbing, would-be comic-book franchise, which <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> as blind as its hero -- not to mention deaf and dumb." [...] Character co-creator Stan Lee himself felt, [...] "hey just wrote the whole thing wrong. They made him too tragic." [...] Ben Affleck won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his work in the movie, as well as for Gigli and Paycheck.|$|E
500|$|Responses to Leonard's {{performance}} {{were mostly}} positive. In a recap {{of the pilot}} episode, Tom Shales of The Washington Post quoted [...] "Leonard has been playing upstanding young men for what seems like forever, but he's {{still one of the}} most outstanding upstanding young men in the acting racket". However, Sherwin Nurland of Slate stated that Leonard <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> so detached that [...] "he'd be better off in another show". In a recap of the season four episode [...] "Ugly" [...] Nina Smith of TV Guide said that she thinks that the most convincing writing of the show has always been the scenes in which Cuddy and Wilson [...] "spar" [...] with House. In a 2008 press conference, Katie Jacobs, who works as an executive producer for the show, praised Leonard for being equally adept at comedy and drama. TV Gal, of Zap2it, stated that she [...] "truly appreciates" [...] what Leonard brings to the show, being the only character who [...] "truly stands up to House" [...] and [...] "quietly and subtly" [...] giving the show [...] "some of its best moments". In an article about whom to keep if the writers of House decided to minor down the cast, Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune said that Wilson can [...] "never, never, never, never" [...] leave the show. Ryan also listed Wilson on her list of [...] "5 Great Characters", saying that Leonard is the [...] "underrated linchpin of the excellent “House” cast".|$|E

500|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} positive, writing that Beyoncé [...] "pants and sweats and grunts (except, you know, sexy-like), her voice {{climbing}} ever higher {{in search of}} an octave big enough to hold it". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that [...] "" [...] if sung by anyone else, 'I Miss You' would be a thin wisp of a ballad, but Beyoncé allows her voice to crack at the right moments, moving tenuously, self-consciously through the soft, circular melody." [...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a nice little nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness." [...] Similarly, Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan felt that the ballad is [...] "too-saccharine-for-its-own-good." [...] The Guardians critics Ben Beaumont Thomas and Rebecca Nicholson ranked [...] "I Miss You" [...] at numbers four and nine respectively on their lists of The 10 Best Tracks of 2011.|$|E
500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to go into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E
2500|$|Tischler, Biberman and McKeage {{warn that}} there is still {{ambiguity}} in the above concepts. In their 2002 article, entitled [...] "Linking emotional intelligence, spirituality and workplace performance: Definitions, models and ideas for research", they reviewed literature on both EI and various aspects of spirituality. They found that both EI and spirituality appear to lead to similar attitudes, behaviors and skills, and that there <b>often</b> <b>seems</b> to be confusion, intersection and linking between the two constructs.|$|E
