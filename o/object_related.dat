50|$|Starting in his seminar La {{relation}} d'objet, Lacan {{distinguishes between}} {{three kinds of}} lack, according {{to the nature of}} the object which is lacking. The first one is Symbolic Castration and its <b>object</b> <b>related</b> is the Imaginary Phallus; the second one is Imaginary Frustration and its <b>object</b> <b>related</b> is the Real Breast; the third kind of lack is Real Privation and its <b>object</b> <b>related</b> is the Symbolic Phallus. The three corresponding agents are the Real Father, the Symbolic Mother, and the Imaginary Father. Of these three forms of lack, castration is the most important from the perspective of the cure.|$|E

5000|$|For, in effect, the Copernican Revolution {{will reduce}} {{philosophical}} investigation to the interrogation {{of a single}} relation: the human-world gap. And indeed, in the reduction of philosophy to the interrogation of this single relation or gap, not only will there be excessive focus on how humans relate to {{the world to the}} detriment of anything else, but this interrogation will be profoundly asymmetrical. For the world or the <b>object</b> <b>related</b> to through the agency of the human will becomes a mere prop or vehicle for human cognition, language, and intentions without contributing anything of its own.|$|E

5000|$|Jack Burnham {{worked as}} a writer, and in the 1960s and 1970s made {{important}} contributions as an art theorist, critic and curator {{in the field of}} systems art. In systems art the concept and ideas of [...] related systems and systems theory are involved in the work to take precedence over traditional aesthetic <b>object</b> <b>related</b> and material concerns. Burnham named Systems art in the 1968 Artforum article [...] "System Esthetics": [...] "He had investigated the effects of science and technology on the sculpture of this century, and saw a dramatic contrast between the handling of the place-oriented object sculpture and the extreme mobility of Systems sculpture".|$|E

This promotion can take several forms such as the Youth Minister making an announcement or the Core members passing out an <b>object</b> <b>related</b> to the theme of the night to try to pique the interest of the teens.

One day, Great Master Sinmuk dozed off during meditation. In a dream {{he saw a}} golden dragon entwined around the gingko tree next to the Heavenly Kings’ Gate. When he awoke, he rushed to the gingko tree and saw a flat stone which appeared {{as if someone had}} carved it. A young boy was asleep on it, so Sinmuk took the boy as his disciple; he later became Great Master Samyeong. In 1800 that gingko tree was destroyed in a fire that also burned down Manseru Pavilion, but the flat stone next to the Heavenly Kings’ Gate remains. Perhaps the stone is awaiting another Ven. Samyeong! ...|$|E
5000|$|In the Russian sports tradition, {{each team}} has a proper name written in {{parentheses}} followed by the indication of the city it represents in brackets: [...] "Spartak" [...] (Moscow), rather than Moscow Spartak, as {{would be in the}} English-language tradition. In English, the parentheses and brackets are usually omitted. Further, while North American team names normally use the plural (Chicago Bulls), Russian team names are usually singular.

After each performance was finished, an <b>object</b> <b>related</b> to the theme was taken to the table were the host and the contestants stood. Each object had a card attached to it, which had a text that could be related to the object or the performance where it came from.
