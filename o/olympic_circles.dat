50|$|The medals were {{produced}} by a company in Bucharest that has an experience of over 20 years in the field. They were cast in gold, silver and bronze and attached to a multicolor cord having {{the colors of the}} <b>Olympic</b> <b>circles.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ampelokipoi B.C. or Ampelokipi B.C. (Α.Ο. Αμπελοκήπων, Αμπελόκηποι) is a Greek {{basketball}} {{club that}} is based in the Athenian neighborhood Ampelokipoi. It plays in the third local division (Γ ΕΣΚΑ), {{but in the past}} it has played in the top-tier Greek Basket League for two seasons. The club's colours are green and white, and its emblem is three circles, like <b>Olympic</b> <b>circles.</b>|$|E
50|$|The six {{large-scale}} {{sculptures of}} George Zongolopoulos in the glyptotheque-square {{are representative of}} the artist’s different creative periods. Each of the sculptures Alexander, Poseidon, Sculpture of TITF (Thessaloniki International Trade Fair), <b>Olympic</b> <b>Circles,</b> Column and Irana tells its own story, while the green parts of the square offer a unique space for strolling and a special outing for adults and children alike.|$|E
50|$|The {{excellent}} {{wind and}} water conditions, the lack of current and commercial boat traffic, and {{the size and shape}} of Fern Ridge Lake allow the use of the standard <b>Olympic</b> <b>circle</b> racing course. This and the availability of camping on the grounds make EYC an ideal place for regattas and other organized sailing events.|$|R
2500|$|A video {{sequence}} used {{in connection with}} the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012 shows two crop circle areas shaped as the Olympic Rings. [...] Another <b>Olympic</b> crop <b>circle</b> area was visible for those landing at Heathrow Airport, London, UK before and during the Olympic Games.|$|R
60|$|But {{whether the}} {{pastoral}} Hermes of the Pelasgians was refined into the messenger-god of Homer, {{or whether the}} name and honours of that god {{were given to the}} rude Priapean patron of the shepherds by way of bringing him into the <b>Olympic</b> <b>circle,</b> it seems impossible to ascertain. These combinations lie far behind the ages of Greece known to us in poetry and history. The province of the god as a deity of flocks is thought to be attested by his favourite companion animal the ram, which often stood beside him in works of art.* In one case, where he is represented with a ram on his shoulder, the legend explained that by carrying a ram round the walls he saved the city of Tanagra from a pestilence.** The Arcadians also represented him carrying a ram under his arm.*** As to the phallic Hermæ, it is only certain that the Athenian taste agreed with that of the Admiralty Islanders in selecting such unseemly images to stand beside every door. But the connection of Hermes with music (he was the inventor of the lyre, as the Homeric Hymn sets forth) may be explained by the musical and poetical character of old Greek shepherd life.|$|R
5000|$|OCSC SAILING is an {{accredited}} US SAILING Certification {{facility in}} Berkeley, California, located on San Francisco Bay. The name is an abbreviation for Olympic Circle Sailing Club, the Olympic Circle being a two nautical mile in diameter ring of racing buoys located directly outside the Berkeley Marina. (Note: There are several <b>Olympic</b> <b>Circles</b> around the country. They {{are used to}} conduct races as there are buoys at every 45 degrees on the circle, with one buoy at the center.) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1997 Zongolopoulos created Tel - Néant, an artwork made by {{stainless}} steel and plexiglas presented in that year's Venice Biennale and in 1999 exhibitions held in Berlin (Wittenbergplatz) and Weimar. Nowadays the sculpture is placed at OTE headquarters in Athens. In 1998, Zongolopoulos created another sculpture from {{stainless steel}} {{under the name}} Composition of Circles or <b>Olympic</b> <b>Circles</b> as {{a reference to the}} Olympic rings while the following year he created Column, a 21 m. high artwork presented at 1999 Venice Biennale and placed later near Evangelismos metro station, Athens. In 2001 Zongolopoulos made his last artwork, a stainless steel sculpture known as Irana (a name taken by its creator from the Dorian Greek form of the name Irene).|$|E
5000|$|From the start, Boston 2024's venue {{selection}} was dogged by missteps. When the redacted bid book {{was released in}} January, property owners in and around designated venues, particularly Widett <b>Circle</b> (<b>Olympic</b> stadium) and Columbia Point (Olympic Village) alleged {{that they had never}} been contacted directly by Boston 2024. In March, Friends of the Public Garden released a formal statement opposing the siting of beach volleyball in Boston Common. The Franklin Park Coalition criticized Boston 2024 for not providing detailed information about their plans for the park.|$|R
