5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by <b>other</b> <b>Democrats,</b> but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E
5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and <b>other</b> <b>Democrats</b> attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|In the at-large races, the two {{incumbent}} Democratic candidates, Victor E. Moore and Paul D'Ortona, led the ticket. Three <b>other</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{were also}} elected: John F. Byrne, Sr., {{who had previously}} been councilman for the 10th district; Henry W. Sawyer, a civil rights lawyer; and Marshall L. Shepard, a clergyman who had served as Commissioner of Records. On the Republican side, incumbent at-large councilman Louis Schwartz was re-elected. The other Republican incumbent, Donald C. Rubel, who had won a special election as an independent Republican backed by Democrats, lost his spot to Thomas M. Foglietta, a young lawyer and son of former councilman Michael Foglietta. Also losing bids for the Republican at-large seats were real estate assessor F. Raymond Heuges and former magistrate Hobson R. Reynolds.|$|E

5|$|Tsongas is an {{advocate}} for universal health care and supports a public health insurance option. In 2010 she voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. In 2012 Tsongas joined a Republican-led effort to repeal a 2.3% sales tax on medical-device manufacturers, which passed the House 270–146; 36 <b>other</b> <b>Democrats</b> voted for it. Tsongas is pro-choice and received a 100% approval rating from Planned Parenthood in 2008. A supporter of LGBT rights, Tsongas cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act; and voted for the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In the November general {{election}} Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In {{the final days}} of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and <b>other</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. to the office, and O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and <b>other</b> <b>Democrats</b> immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues.|$|E

25|$|Bentsen {{considered}} {{running for}} president in the 1992 presidential election, but he, along with many <b>other</b> <b>Democrats,</b> backed out because of Bush's apparent popularity following the 1991 Gulf War.

25|$|During {{his time}} in the U.S. Senate, Feingold gained a {{reputation}} as a political maverick with an independent streak. When he broke with his own party, it was often because he was taking a more liberal or populist position than <b>other</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Throughout his congressional tenure, several ranking systems placed Feingold among the nation's most liberal or progressive senators.|$|E
25|$|Mazzocchi {{was also}} {{influential}} in Democratic politics.

But, after being advised by party leaders that he was too radical for the electorate and would endanger the candidacies of <b>other</b> <b>Democrats,</b> he never undertook a campaign.|$|E

25|$|Polk {{strongly}} supported expansion, and relations with Mexico and Great Britain, the country's southern and northern neighbors respectively, dominated Polk's presidency. Polk, like many <b>other</b> <b>Democrats,</b> fervently {{believed in the}} idea of Manifest Destiny, and he sought to create a bicoastal nation. Polk was successful in pursuing this goal, as his presidency saw the partition of Oregon Country with Britain, the annexation of Texas, and the acquisition of vast amounts of land from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Democrats {{claimed that}} the change was illegal, and that {{therefore}} Malcolm Smith was still the Majority Leader and Temporary President. According to Smith and <b>other</b> <b>Democrats,</b> Senator Neil Breslin had accepted a motion to adjourn, and therefore ended the session before the Republicans voted to change leadership. Republican Senator Libous argues that since his original motion was on the floor, the session {{could not have been}} adjourned. Furthermore, like all motions, motions for adjournment require a vote, which never took place before Breslin adjourned the session.|$|E

Although 206 amendments were scheduled for floor votes, they were combined into only 11, which enabled quicker passage of the bill.|$|E
50|$|Nelson's {{votes in}} the Senate often placed him {{at odds with the}} {{leadership}} of his party.

Mary Landrieu was the only <b>other</b> <b>Democrat</b> to place to the right of any Republicans (she placed to the right of Chafee). A similar 2007 National Journal congressional vote rating went evenfurther, placing him to the right of eight Senate Republicans (theabove five as well as Richard Lugar, Norm Coleman, and Mike DeWine), with Landrieu once again placing to the right of Chafee andbeing the only <b>other</b> <b>Democrat</b> to place to the right of any Republicans.
