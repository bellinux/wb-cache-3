40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis is laying bare the serious shortcomings {{in the regulation}} and supervision of financial markets. At present there is no balance between risk, on the one hand, and responsibility, and legal liability, on the other. The proposal for a directive under consideration here is intended to establish just such {{a balance between the}} risk inherent in the activities of investment funds and the responsibility they bear as a result. On 30 April 2009, in response to a number of Parliament <b>own-initiative</b> <b>reports</b> and ever increasing public pressure, the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers which is designed to create a legal framework for all funds not covered by the UCITS Directive. This legal framework would provide the basis for a more effective, European {{solution to the problem of}} investment fund regulation by replacing the plethora of national rules currently applicable in this area. Although the mere fact that the Commission is taking action, and the approach it has chosen, are welcome, the proposal needs to be improved in certain key areas. Rapporteur's position: Your rapporteur would like to draw attention to a number of serious shortcomings in th...|$|R
50|$|Ferreira was a Member of the European Parliament {{from the}} 2004 European {{elections}} until her resignation in 2016. Throughout {{her time in}} parliament, she served {{as a member of}} the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In this capacity, she drafted the committee’s <b>own-initiative</b> <b>report</b> on closer coordination of economic policies, which calls for the European Central Bank (ECB) to be granted powers to monitor “financial stability in the euro-area” and to be involved “in EU-wide macroprudential supervision of systematically important financial institutions.” She was also in charge of the parliament’s report on the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure in 2011 and led the parliament’s work on the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Besides his {{constitutional}} work, Brok {{is best known}} for his acitivities on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was chairman of the committee in 1997-2007, but ousted after a contest within the centre-right European People’s Party by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, who was followed in 2009 by Gabriele Albertini; Brok returned to the position for the period from 2012 until 2017. He was the Parliament's main rapporteur on enlargement and rapporteur for the EU's enlargement strategy and the European External Action Service (along with Guy Verhofstadt). In 2010, he joined the Friends of the EEAS, a unofficial and independent pressure group formed because of concerns that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was not paying sufficient attention to the Parliament and was sharing too little information on the formation of the European External Action Service. In a 2013 <b>own-initiative</b> <b>report</b> drawn up by Brok and fellow MEP Roberto Gualtieri, the European Parliament called for overhauling the EEAS and increasing parliamentary influence over the EU’s diplomatic service.|$|E
5000|$|United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice commented {{the law as}} [...] "not necessary", while White House {{spokesman}} Scott McClellan called its adoption [...] "unfortunate", adding [...] "It {{does not}} serve the purpose of {{peace and stability in}} the Taiwan Strait". In speaking about the law the United States repeated that it remained supportive of the One China policy as the US defines it, did not support Taiwan independence, and opposed any unilateral action to change the status quo. The United States House of Representatives approved a resolution criticizing the PRC for the approval of the PRC law in Beijing. The resolution expressed grave concern about the law and said the PRC law provides a legal justification for PRC to use force against Taiwan, in its words, altering the status quo in the region.In response to the enactment of the PRC law, the European Union issued a statement urging [...] "all sides to avoid any unilateral action that could stoke tensions," [...] and recalled the [...] "constant principles that guide its policy, namely its commitment to the principle of one China and the peaceful resolution of dispute...and its opposition to any use of force."

40|$|The European Union {{is founded}} {{on a set of}} common {{principles}} of democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights, as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union. Whereas future Member States are vetted for their compliance with these values before they accede to the Union, no similar method exists to supervise adherence to these foundational principles after accession. EU history proved that this ‘Copenhagen dilemma’ was far from theoretical. EU Member State governments’ adherence to foundational EU values cannot be taken for granted. Violations may happen in individual cases, or in a systemic way, which may go as far as overthrowing the rule of law. Against this background the European Parliament initiated a Legislative <b>Own-Initiative</b> <b>Report</b> on the establishment of an EU mechanism on democracy, {{the rule of law and}} fundamental rights and proposed among others a Scoreboard on the basis of common and objective indicators by which foundational values can be measured. This Research Paper assesses the need and possibilities for the establishment of an EU Scoreboard, as well as its related social, economic, legal and political ‘costs and benefits’...|$|E
