The conduct of the war was brutal <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>with</b> massacres of civilians and prisoners being widespread.

25|$|The Phaistos Disc (also spelled Phaistos Disk, Phaestos Disc) is a disk of fired clay {{from the}} Minoan palace of Phaistos {{on the island}} of Crete, {{possibly}} dating to the middle or late Minoan Bronze Age (second millennium B.C.).

25|$|This {{blocking}} {{force of}} Romans prevented the Carthaginians from sending reinforcements from Iberia to Hannibal {{or to the}} insurgent Gauls in northern Italy during critical stages of the war. Hasdrubal acted by marching into Roman territory in 215 BC and offered battle at Dertosa. In this battle, he used his cavalry superiority to clear the field and to envelop the enemy <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>with</b> his infantry, a tactic that had been very successfully employed in Italy. However, the Romans broke through the thinned-out line in the centre and defeated both wings separately, inflicting severe losses, but not without taking heavy losses themselves.|$|E

These engagements resulted in further casualties <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>with</b> several groups of Japanese being killed in firefights with New Zealand patrols. On 12 November, the islands were declared clear of Japanese forces, although Japanese holdouts were sighted in the jungles into January 1944.|$|E

Hughes received his secondary education at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, before undertaking a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Sydney from 1914. In June that year, he was commissioned as an officer in the 26th Infantry Regiment, Citizens Military Force. In his youth, Hughes had acquired a keen interest in aviation, which led him to apply for the Australian Flying Corps; his application was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|One find of {{particular}} interest is an 8 by 11cm stone slab, found in the residential area on the eastern slope of Yodfat, covered <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>with</b> scratched drawings made by a pointed tool. One side depicts a building with a triangular roof upon a podium, a small tree and a harp, and is thought to portray a Nefesh (a traditional Judean mausoleum). The {{other side of the}} stone features a crab, the astrological symbol of the Hebrew month of Tammuz, {{on the first day of}} which Yodfat fell. The stone is believed to have been the work of a besieged Jew anticipating his own impending doom, and its likeness has been etched on a modern memorial to the defenders of Yodfat placed at the foot of the Roman siege ramp.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the twentieth century, historians of {{philosophy}} initiated a wide-ranging project aiming at systematically reconstructing the foundations of the unwritten doctrines. The group of researchers who led this investigation, which became well-known among classicists and historians, came to be called the 'Tübingen School' (in German: Tübinger Platonschule), because some of its leading members were based at the University of Tübingen in southern Germany. On the other hand, numerous scholars had serious reservations about the project or even condemned it altogether. Many critics thought the evidence and sources used in the Tübingen reconstruction were insufficient. Others even contested the existence of the unwritten doctrines or at least doubted their systematic character and considered them mere tentative proposals. The intense and sometimes polemical disputes between the advocates and critics of the Tübingen School were conducted <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>with</b> great energy. Advocates suggested it amounted to a 'paradigm shift' in Plato studies.|$|E

25|$|The chancel arch is double-chamfered <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>with</b> part-octagonal {{responds}} and crenellated capitals. At {{the lower}} part is a late 19th-century wooden rood screen of Perpendicular style, of three sectionsvoided in the centre section and void above with panelling below in the outer, and tracery above in all, the top line with crenellations. The chancel and both side chapels are separated by screens of the same style and date, and include openings {{to the north and}} south chapels. Sited at the face of the screens within the chancel, and part of the same design, are choir stalls of mirror repeat. Behind the screens are chapels, north and south, each defined by two Perpendicular chancel bays, the north with heavily moulded arches, the south double-chamfered. The north is set on side responds and central piers of semi-circular facets with hollows between, and part-octagonal capitals. The south is set on half-pier responds on part-octagonal capitals attached to extension of the arch double-chamfer. The chancel stained glass east window is by Ward and Hughes, c.1970. On either side of the window is a corner niche with 19th-century figures. Further church stained glass is by Powell & Sons.|$|E
25|$|Manuel mobilized a large force, {{well beyond}} {{what he was}} obliged, {{according}} to the chronicler William of Tyre: 150 galleys, sixty horse-carriers and a dozen dromons specially constructed to carry siege engines. The fleet set sail from the port of Melibotos in the Dardanelles on 8 July 1169. After defeating a small Egyptian scouting squadron near Cyprus, Kontostephanos arrived at Tyre and Acre in late September to find that Amalric had undertaken no preparations whatsoever. The delays {{on the part of}} the Crusaders infuriated Kontostephanos and sow mistrust among the ostensible allies. It was not until mid-October that the combined armies and fleets set forth, arriving at Damietta two weeks later. The Christians delayed three days in attacking the city, allowing Saladin to hastily move in troops and supplies. The siege was prosecuted with vigour <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>with</b> Kontostephanos and his men constructing huge siege towers, but the besiegers were hampered by the growing mistrust between Byzantines and Crusaders, especially as the Byzantines' supplies dwindled, and Amalric refused to share his own with them but sold them at exorbitant prices. Exasperated by the dragging-on of the siege and the suffering of his troops, Kontostephanos once again disobeyed Manuel's instructions ordering him to obey Amalric in all things, and launched with his troops a final attack on the city. As the Byzantines were about to storm the walls, Amalric stopped them by announcing that a negotiated surrender of Damietta had just taken place. The discipline and cohesion of the Byzantine army almost instantly disintegrated after the news of the peace deal were announced, with troops burning the engines and boarding the ships in groups without order. Left with only six ships, Kontostephanos accompanied Amalric back to Palestine, returning home with part of his army by land through the crusader states of the Levant, while about half of the Byzantine ships that had sailed from Damietta was lost in a series of storms on its return journey, with the last ships arriving in their home ports only in late spring 1170.|$|E
