5|$|Diệm's {{political}} career began in July 1954, {{when he was}} appointed the Prime Minister of the State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> by former Emperor Bảo Đại, who was Head of State. At the time, Vietnam had been partitioned at the Geneva Conference after {{the defeat of the}} French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, with the State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> ruling the country south of the 17th parallel. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Diệm and Bảo Đại were locked in a power struggle. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Diệm scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Diệm won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam.</b>|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Imperial Japan {{attacked}} Indochina and wrested {{control from}} France, {{but when they}} were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum resulted. The communist-dominated Vietminh of Ho Chi Minh fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted {{to regain control of}} their colony by creating the French Union-allied State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> Up until 1954, the First Indochina War raged. In 1954, the French lost the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference was held to determine the future of French Indochina. The Vietminh were given control of North Vietnam, while the State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> controlled the territory south of the 17th parallel. The Geneva agreements, which the State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> did not sign, called for reunification elections to be held in 1956. The State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War, which saw it as a partner in a fight against the spread of communism.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, by {{the time}} the Paris Peace Accord was concluded, South Vietnam possessed the fourth largest air force in the world. Despite their size, however, Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force {{operations}} were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in U.S. military aid. Furthermore, the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to the threat posed by formidable anti-aircraft weapons deployed by North Vietnam. When the North Vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975, the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force was virtually handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of the Vietnam People's Army swept through the Central Highlands of South Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Known as Double Seven Day, July 7 was {{the ninth}} anniversary of Diệm's 1954 {{ascension}} to Prime Minister of the State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> In October 1955, following a fraudulent referendum, Diệm established the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> generally known as South Vietnam, and declared himself President. The night of July 6, 1963, had started in a festive mood as Diệm awarded decorations to military officers at a ceremony. Among {{those in the}} audience were Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Dương Văn Minh, the Chief of Staff of the Army of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and the Presidential Military Advisor, respectively.

The objective of the campaign was to prevent the transit of People's Army <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> (PAVN) personnel and supplies on the logistical corridor known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese) that ran from the southwestern Democratic Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> (North Vietnam) through the southeastern portion of the Kingdom of Laos and into the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> (South Vietnam).|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Trung {{took off}} again and flew out to Phước Long Province, which {{was occupied by}} the Provisional Revolutionary Government since North Vietnamese troops had captured it earlier in the year, and he was warmly received by North Vietnamese soldiers. The North Vietnamese claimed that Trung had been a Viet Cong agent since 1969, and was infiltrated into the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force where he served with the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force 540th Fighter Squadron of the 3rd Air Force Division. Trung later revealed that he was originally from Bến Tre Province in the Mekong region, where his father had served as the district secretary of the People's Revolutionary Party. In 1963 Trung's father was killed and his body was mutilated by the South Vietnamese police. Angered {{by the death of}} his father, Trung vowed to take revenge on the South Vietnamese Government, so in 1969 he secretly joined the Viet Cong after he had been accepted into the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force.|$|E

5|$|The Cambodian–Vietnamese War was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between the Socialist Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and Democratic Kampuchea. The war began with isolated clashes along the land and maritime boundaries <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and Kampuchea between 1975 and 1977, occasionally involving division-sized military formations. On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the Khmer Rouge government from power.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the French Army at Điện Biên Phủ in 1954, {{followed}} by the Geneva Accords, led to a divided Vietnam. The French-backed State <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> led by former Emperor Bảo Đại, provisionally held control south of the 17th parallel. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh held the north under the Democratic Republic <b>of</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> which Hồ Chí Minh had proclaimed in 1945.
