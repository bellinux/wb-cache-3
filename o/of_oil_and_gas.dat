5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas.</b> Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. Another potential source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the large dams prominent in Soviet times largely ended in the 1990s {{with the creation of}} the Russian Federation. In addition, due to the post-Soviet recession, much of the country's infrastructure, including dams, fell into disrepair. Use <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> for energy took priority in Russia and renewable energy was ignored. This policy lasted until 2008, when Medvedev announced reforms to Russia's energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy. Since then, there has been rapid development of new renewable energy sources.|$|E
5|$|Miri mainly {{relies on}} its {{oil and gas}} industry, which {{contributes}} significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Sarawak. Sarawak Shell Berhad (upstream business) and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd have their offices based in Miri. Other multinational oil and gas companies also set up their offices here, including Nippon Oil, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Technip, Ranhill WorleyParsons, and Petra Resources Sdn Bhd. In 1989, Asam Paya Oilfield was discovered in Sarawak inland areas. In 2010, Petronas discovered two oil fields offshore between Bintulu and Miri. In 2011, new underground reserves <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> deposits were discovered by Nippon Oil in an inland region near Miri, Sarawak.|$|E

Only 26 countries other than the United States have a {{gross domestic}} product exceeding Houston's regional gross area product (GAP). In 2010, mining (which consists almost entirely of exploration and production <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> in Houston) accounted for 26.3% of Houston's GAP up sharply in response to high energy prices and a decreased worldwide surplus of oil production capacity, followed by engineering services, health services, and manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|When Flem D. Sampson {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1927, he appointed Willis {{to fill his}} seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1928, Willis was elected to a full four-year term representing the Court's Seventh Appellate District. Holding a state-level office increased his political stature, as did revising Thornton on the Law <b>of</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gas,</b> a six-volume law reference, during his time on the bench. His political image was not badly tarnished when he lost his seat on the court to Alex Ratliff during the Democratic surge that swept Franklin D. Roosevelt into the presidency in 1932.

He became interested in politics, but his early races for office were unsuccessful with the exception of his four-year stint as city solicitor for Ashland, Kentucky. Finally in 1927, newly elected governor Flem D. Sampson appointed Willis to the Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the court of last resort in the state. Willis went on to win a full four-year term on the court in 1928, and distinguished himself by revising Thornton on the Law <b>of</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gas,</b> a six-volume law reference.

Dozens <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> wells in the Bay of Campeche owned by Pemex were evacuated, while Shell Oil Company evacuated some people from an oil platform farther north. Approximately 6,500people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Tampico and flood prone locations in San Luis Potosi. The General Francisco Javier Mina International Airport closed {{for most of the day}} on August23. A total of 37ports along the Gulf Coast of Mexico were closed.

5|$|Petronas, a Malaysian {{national}} {{oil and gas}} company, {{was formed}} in 1974. As a result, a concession system was changed into production sharing contract system (PSC) between Shell and Petronas. All the foreign oil companies including Shell required to obtain licenses from Petronas. The first two PSCs were signed on 30 November 1976. Foreign oil companies are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, the oil companies will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted. Petronas also formed a company named Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd which was {{directly involved in the}} exploration, development, and production <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> in the country. Petronas also initiated the Baram Delta Gas Gathering (Bardegg) project which involves the collection and compression of gas from five fields, namely Betty, Bekor, Baram, Baronia, and West Lutong, located 10km to 45km offshore from Miri. This is to ensure the minimisation of gas loss during oil production. Petronas and Shell are also involved in educational outreach activities such as awarding scholarships to deserving students. Both companies are also involved in Malaysian first rig-to-reef project, in an effort to preserve bio-marine life in the sea offshore Miri. In this project, an abandoned offshore platform was made {{to become part of the}} Siwa reef. Both companies also started to establish Piasau Nature Reserve in 2014.|$|E
