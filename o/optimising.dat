5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore <b>optimising</b> availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on <b>optimising</b> their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 2008, it was {{announced}} that the game would be released on Valve Corporation's content delivery system Steam on the official release date of 6 February; the game requires Steam to install and run for both retail and electronic versions and is integrated into Valve's Steamworks programme to allow updates and multiplayer to function more efficiently. The game's release was delayed in December 2008 to allow for the development of extended multiplayer features, with a new release date for March 2009. A demonstration of the game, featuring the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Lagos, was released over Steam on 20 February 2009. The game was released on 3 March 2009. Since release, Empire: Total War has been subject to updates delivered through the Steam system, aimed at <b>optimising</b> performance and removing any bugs remaining in the game.|$|E

30|$|Clearly, {{optimisation}} {{of assembly}} scheduling in VCIM systems is a multi-dimensional optimisation problem. It {{is required to}} <b>optimise</b> four dimensions at the same time: assembly agent selection, manufacturing agent selection, assembly sequence, and manufacturing sequence. There are four sub-problems to be <b>optimised.</b> If each sub-problem is solved at a time, the global <b>optimised</b> solution cannot be achieved. Therefore, an integrated scheduling approach as {{presented in this paper}} is required to obtain a global <b>optimised</b> solution.|$|R
30|$|In {{every one}} of the 10 cases, the <b>optimised</b> OSEM {{reconstruction}} scored higher than the default OSEM reconstruction. Although the noise levels in the <b>optimised</b> OSEM images were higher, they were still considered to be acceptable by the radiologist and the increased contrast levels in the <b>optimised</b> OSEM resulted in it being scored more highly than the default reconstruction.|$|R
25|$|<b>Optimising</b> the {{precision}} parameters corresponds to <b>optimising</b> the gain of prediction errors (c.f., Kalman gain). In neuronally plausible implementations of predictive coding, this corresponds to <b>optimising</b> the excitability superficial pyramidal cells {{and has been}} interpreted in terms of attentional gain.|$|E
25|$|Because the plasmid is the “vehicle” {{from which}} the {{immunogen}} is expressed, <b>optimising</b> vector design for maximal protein expression is essential. One way of enhancing protein expression is by <b>optimising</b> the codon usage of pathogenic mRNAs for eukaryotic cells. Pathogens often have different AT-contents than the target species, so altering the gene sequence of the immunogen to reflect the codons more commonly used in the target species may improve its expression.|$|E
25|$|In {{predictive}} coding, <b>optimising</b> model parameters {{through a}} gradient ascent {{on the time}} integral of free energy (free action) reduces to associative or Hebbian plasticity and is associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain.|$|E

The static and dynamic performance of the <b>optimised</b> design is analyzed using an accurate in-house 2 D electro-opto-thermal laser simulator. The <b>optimised</b> structure Is shown to have a lower threshold current, higher efficiency, higher modulation bandwidth and lower vertical beam divergence compared to a reference structure with a conventional design. Large-signal 10 Gbit/s digital modulation simulations were performed and demonstrate the improved performance of the <b>optimised</b> structure especially under high temperature operation...|$|R

25|$|Early {{aquaculture}} {{research into}} <b>optimising</b> techniques for sea sponge aquaculture used {{a number of}} farming methods. However, commercial sponge farming was met with severe resistance and interference from sponge fisherman, who believed that their continued income was under threat. The opposition by commercial sponge farmers resulted in a low market penetration and poor consumer adoption of aquacultured sponge products.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} with IHC staining is overcoming specific or non-specific background. Optimisation of fixation methods and times, pre-treatment with blocking agents, incubating antibodies with high salt, and <b>optimising</b> post-antibody wash buffers and wash times are all important for obtaining high quality immunostaining. In addition, the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls for staining are essential for determining specificity.|$|E
30|$|At one level, this {{is because}} the {{baseline}} against which we are comparing performance is relatively simple and mature. Our corresponding implementation is therefore relatively well <b>optimised.</b> In contrast, our proposed implementation is novel and has not been significantly <b>optimised.</b> However, we do not see it as fruitful to <b>optimise</b> our current implementation: we believe the disappointing results are caused by two other issues.|$|R
40|$|Considering the ISIS muon target as a reference, Geant 4 {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed to <b>optimise</b> the target parameters with respect to muon and pion yield.

25|$|Despite <b>optimising</b> {{revenue in}} theory, {{introduction}} of yield management {{does not always}} achieve this in practice because of corporate image problems. In 2002, Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, experimented with yield management for frequent loyalty card passengers. The fixed pricing model that had existed for decades was replaced with a more demand-responsive pricing model, but this reform proved highly unpopular with passengers, leading to widespread protests {{and a decline in}} passenger numbers.|$|E
25|$|In {{single-celled}} organisms, regulatory networks {{respond to}} the external environment, <b>optimising</b> the cell {{at a given time}} for survival in this environment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on genes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol. This process, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its living, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would enhance its survival prospects.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{optimisation}} of exact renormalisation group (ERG) flows. We {{explain why the}} convergence of approximate solutions towards the physical theory is <b>optimised</b> by appropriate choices of the regularisation. We consider specific <b>optimised</b> regulators for bosonic and fermionic fields and compare the <b>optimised</b> ERG flows with generic ones. This is done up to second order in the derivative expansion at both vanishing and non-vanishing temperature. We find that <b>optimised</b> flows at finite temperature factorise. This corresponds to the disentangling of thermal and quantum fluctuations. A similar factorisation is found at second order in the derivative expansion. The corresponding <b>optimised</b> flow for a ``proper-time renormalisation group'' is also provided to leading order in the derivative expansion.

To comply with the EU emission limit of 0.1ng I-TEQ/m3 modern incinerators operate in conditions minimising dioxin formation and are equipped with pollution control devices which catch the low amounts produced. Recent information is showing for example that dioxin levels in populations near incinerators in Lisbon and Madeira have not risen since the plants began operating in 1999 and 2002 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Limits {{vary with}} {{temperature}} and pressure, but are normally {{expressed in terms}} of volume percentage at 25°C and atmospheric pressure. These limits are relevant both to producing and <b>optimising</b> explosion or combustion, as in an engine, or to preventing it, as in uncontrolled explosions of build-ups of combustible gas or dust. Attaining the best combustible or explosive mixture of a fuel and air (the stoichiometric proportion) is important in internal combustion engines such as gasoline or diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay or ELISA is {{a diagnostic}} method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimised by <b>optimising</b> blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.|$|E

25|$|Services {{are often}} {{arranged}} {{to operate at}} regular intervals throughout the day {{or part of the}} day (known as clock-face scheduling). Often, more frequent services or even extra routes are operated during the morning and evening rush hours. Coordination between services at interchange points is important to reduce the total travel time for passengers. This can be done by coordinating shuttle services with main routes, or by creating a fixed time (for instance twice per hour) when all bus and rail routes meet at a station and exchange passengers. There is often a potential conflict between this objective and <b>optimising</b> the utilisation of vehicles and drivers.|$|E
