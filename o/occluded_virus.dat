40|$|Poliovirus in fecal homogenates {{was used}} to {{determine}} the protection against inactivation by chlorination afforded virus that was occluded within particulates. Virus that was closely associated with or occluded within small fecal particulates was protected. A fourfold increase in combined residual chlorine was required to achieve the same degree of inactivation for <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> as for free or secondarily adsorbed virus. A combined chlorine residual of 6. 6 mg/liter was necessary to achieve 50 % inactivation in 15 min at pH 8. 0 and 22 degrees C in a particulate suspension containing <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> compared to 1. 4 mg/liter for free virus. These differences were found to be relatively small compared to differences due to the presence of dissolved organics or between free and combined chlorine residuals. The results suggest different mechanisms of protection due to adsorption and occlusion...|$|E
40|$|Autographa {{california}} {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (AcMNPV) {{contains a}} gene, ptp, encoding a protein tyrosine/serine phosphatase, BV-PTP. To investigate the biological function of ptp in the baculoviral replication cycle, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus, vPTPdel, in which the catalytically active site of BV-PTP was deleted. Although the vPTPdel mutant was viable in cell culture, it was partially defective in <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> production in SF- 21 but not TN- 368 cell lines. SF- 21 cells infected with vPTPdel were heterogeneous {{in their ability to}} support <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> production. These results suggest that BV-PTP functions in a cell line-specific and possibly a cell cycle-specific fashion. The yield of occlusion bodies, infectivity (concentration of virus causing 50 % mortality) and virulence (the time at which 50 % of the cells died) of vPTPdel appeared to be normal in insect larvae. We identified a 35 -kDa phosphoprotein as a potential target of the BV-PTP in SF- 21 cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{structural}} glycopeptide, gp 41, {{derived from}} the <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> of the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus was characterized. The peptide specifically bound wheat germ agglutinin but was not recognized {{by a panel of}} seven other lectins. Reactivity with wheat germ agglutinin was eliminated by treatment of gp 41 with beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, indicating that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) was present as terminal residues. gp 41 was efficiently galactosylated by galactosyltransferase only in the presence of Nonidet P- 40, suggesting that GlcNAc residues are not exposed {{on the surface of the}} virion. Metabolic labelling of gp 41 with [3 H]GlcNAc occurred in the presence of tunicamycin. The carbohydrate was released by alkaline borohydride treatment and comigrated with N-acetylglucosaminitol in descending paper chromatography. The data indicate that gp 41 contains single residues of GlcNAc O glycosidically linked to the polypeptide chain. Evidence suggesting that gp 41 is located in the region between the envelope membrane and the capsid (defined here as the tegument) of the <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> is also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of baculoviruses to insects for bioassay purposes is carried out, in most cases, by contamination of food surfaces with a known amount of occlusion bodies (OBs). Since per os infection {{is the natural}} route of infection, <b>occluded</b> recombinant <b>viruses</b> containing crystal protein genes (cry 1 Ab and cry 1 Ac) from Bacillus thuringiensis were constructed for comparison with the baculovirus prototype Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV). The transfer vector pAcUW 2 B was used for construction of <b>occluded</b> recombinant <b>viruses.</b> The transfer vector containing the crystal protein genes was cotransfected with linearized DNA from a non-occluded recombinant virus. The isolation of recombinant viruses was greatly facilitated by the reduction of background "wild type" virus and the increased proportion of recombinant viruses. Since the recombinant viruses containing full-length and truncated forms of the crystal protein genes {{did not seem to}} improve the pathogenicity of the recombinant viruses when compared with the wild type AcNPV, and in order to compare expression levels of the full-length crystal proteins produced by non-occluded and <b>occluded</b> recombinant <b>viruses</b> the full-length cry 1 Ab and cry 1 Ac genes were chosen for construction of <b>occluded</b> recombinant <b>viruses.</b> The recombinant viruses containing full-length and truncated forms of the crystal protein genes did not seem to improve its pathogenicity but the size of the larvae infected with the recombinant viruses was significantly smaller than that of larvae infected with the wild type virus...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Certain insect baculoviruses are {{occluded}} in a proteinaceous, {{crystalline structure}} which serves {{to protect the}} virus outside its insect host. Two groups of <b>occluded</b> <b>viruses</b> have been defined: the nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPVs) (Baculovirus Subgroup A), having many virions occluded per crystal, and the granulosis viruses (GVs) (Baculovirus Subgroup B), having only one virion per crystal. Using the cloned polyhedrin gene from the Orgyia pseudotsugata MNPV (OpMNPV) as a hybridization probe, a 2 kilobase Sal I fragment from the Trichoplusia ni granulosis virus (TnGV) was identified as the locus of the granulin gene. This fragment was cloned into pUC 8 and mapped with restriction enzymes. Three fragments of about 400 base-pairs each were subcloned into reciprocal M 13 vectors and their nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy method. A 1. 3 kilobase Eco RI clone containing most of the granulin gene from TnGV {{was used as a}} hybridization probe to identify the granulin gene from Pieris brassicae granulosis virus (PbGV).

40|$|The {{replication}} of Heliothis zea {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} was studied in the H. zea (IPLB-HZ- 1075 A) insect cell line. Infectious extracellular virus was first detected at 24 h post-infection (p,i.) and reached a maximum titre of l × 107 p. f,u,/ml at 90 h p,i. Viral DNA synthesis was detected by 14 h p. i. and increased xponentially until 32 h p. i. Using [35 S]methionine pulse-labelling, 38 virus-induced proteins were identified, ranging in mol. wt. from 13 K to 128 K. Virus-induced protein synthesis was temporally regulated, with new proteins detected between 8 and 28 h p. i. Host cell protein synthesis continued throughout the virus replication cycle (48 h), although at gradually decreasing rates. Fifteen extracellular virus structural proteins were identified, and all but one comigrated with virus-induced proteins. Thirty-two structural proteins of tissue culture-derived, <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> were identified using silver staining procedures...|$|E
40|$|Baculoviruses {{have long}} been shown to {{regulate}} apoptosis in cultured insect cells. Recently, this phenomenon was also reported to occur in vivo, reinforcing the importance of apoptosis in insect immunity against viruses. The vP 35 del virus, an Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) recombinant, was previously shown to induce apoptosis in Anticarsia gemmatalis cultured cells. In order to verify the AcMNPV interaction with hemocytes, apoptosis induction in vivo and its effects upon infectivity, we studied the course of intrahemocoelic infection of recombinant viruses (vHSGFP and vHSGFP/P 35 del) in A. gemmatalis larvae. Insect development and mortality were monitored and infection progress was followed by light, fluorescence and electron microscopy. For all doses tested, vHSGFP/P 35 del caused lower mortality than vHSGFP. Mortality of 95 % occurred with a dose of 4 × 106 PFUs of vHSGFP, which was reduced to 60 % for vHSGFP/P 35 del. GFP expression was first observed at 3 h p. i. for the two viruses, increasing for vHSGFP (40 % at 120 h p. i.) and decreasing for vHSGFP/P 35 del (0 % at 120 h p. i.). The virus vHSGFP/P 35 del induced apoptosis in hemocytes, with some budded virus being produced, and fragmented cells were observed between 24 and 72 h p. i. The recombinant vHSGFP induced typical wild-type cytopathic effects, with low production of <b>occluded</b> <b>viruses</b> until 120 h p. i. Plasmatocytes and granular hemocytes type 1 were the hemocytes most susceptible to both viruses. For these experimental conditions, we concluded that A. gemmatalis is a semi-permissive host to AcMNPV; moreover, apoptosis reduces AcMNPV infectivity and the p 35 gene is essential for blocking apoptosis in this system...|$|R
40|$|Direct, {{indirect}} {{and double}} antibody sandwich methods of ELISA were examined {{for their ability}} to detect and discriminate between granulosis viruses from Pieris brassicae, Agrotis segetum and Cydia pomonella and for their specificity in the presence of host material. The indirect method was the most sensitive, capable of detecting down to about I ng of dissolved capsules/ml compared with IO ng/ml for the double antibody sandwich method and 25 ng/ml for the direct method. The double antibody sandwich method showed greatest discrimination between different granulosis viruses; the direct method was not quite so specific and the indirect method varied considerably depending upon the antibody concentration used although even with this latter method cross-reactions were restricted to baculoviruses and did not occur with <b>occluded</b> insect <b>viruses</b> in other taxonomic groups. All three methods were highly specific in the presence of large amounts of host material and could be used to assay virus in diseased larvae, although at very high levels of contamination, equivalent to adding I 0 O healthy larvae to one diseased larva, only the double antibody sandwich method could still reliably detect virus though with reduced absorbance readings. Possible reasons why the ELISA shows much greater discrimination between different Baculovirus inclusion bodies than other serological techniques are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Baculoviruses (Baculoviridae) are <b>occluded</b> DNA <b>viruses</b> {{that are}} lethal {{pathogens}} of the larval stages of some lepidopterans, mosquitoes, and sawflies (phytophagous Hymenoptera). These viruses {{have been developed}} as biological insecticides for control of insect pests and as expression vectors in biotechnological applications. Natural and laboratory populations frequently harbor covert infections by baculoviruses, often at a prevalence exceeding 50 %. Covert infection can comprise either non-productive latency or sublethal infection involving low level production of virus progeny. Latency in cell culture systems involves {{the expression of a}} small subset of viral genes. In contrast, covert infection in lepidopterans is associated with differential infection of cell types, modulation of virus gene expression and avoidance of immune system clearance. The molecular basis for covert infection may reside in the regulation of host–virus interactions through the action of microRNAs (miRNA). Initial findings suggest that insect nudiviruses and vertebrate herpesviruses may provide useful analogous models for exploring the mechanisms of covert infection by baculoviruses. These pathogens adopt mixed-mode transmission strategies that depend on the relative fitness gains that accrue through vertical and horizontal transmission. This facilitates virus persistence when opportunities for horizontal transmission are limited and ensures virus dispersal in migratory host species. However, when host survival is threatened by environmental or physiological stressors, latent or persistent infections can be activated to produce lethal disease, followed by horizontal transmission. Covert infection has also been implicated in population level effects on host–pathogen dynamics due to the reduced reproductive capacity of infected females. We conclude that covert infections provide many opportunities to examine the complexity of insect–virus pathosystems at the organismal level and to explore the evolutionary and ecological relationships of these pathogens with major crop and forest pests...|$|R
40|$|An {{alkaline}} protease {{was found}} {{to be associated with the}} granulosis virus of the Indian meal moth. Plodia interpunctella. The protease was located within the protein matrix of the <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> and hydrolyzed the major constituent of this matrix, a 28, 000 -dalton protein (granulin), to a mixture of polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 10, 000 to 27, 000. A rapid, sensitive assay for the protease was developed using radioactively labeled granulosis virus as substrate. With this assay, the proteolytic activity could be detected by measuring the release of acid-soluble peptides from the labeled virus. The protease had a pH optimum of 10. 5 and a temperature optimum of 40 degrees C and was inhibited by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and L-(1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone. Purification of the protease from matrix protein was achieved by anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. The molecular weight of the isolated protease, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, was approximately 14, 000...|$|E
40|$|A 78 -kDa protein was {{produced}} in bacteria from a clone of the 1, 629 -nucleotide open reading frame located immediately downstream from the polyhedrin gene of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. The identity of this protein was confirmed by its reactivity with peptide antiserum and amino terminal peptide sequencing after purification from transformed bacteria. The polypeptide was used to produce polyclonal antisera in rabbits. Immunoblot analysis of insect cells infected with the baculovirus indicated that two related proteins with molecular masses of 78 and 83 kDa were synthesized late in infection. Biochemical fractionation studies indicated that both of these proteins were present in purified nucleocapsids from budded and <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> preparations. Immunoprecipitation of 32 P-labeled proteins and treatment of purified nucleocapsids with alkaline phosphatase demonstrated that the 83 -kDa protein was a phosphorylated derivative of the 78 -kDa protein. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the proteins were localized to regions of nucleocapsid assembly within the infected cell {{and appeared to be}} associated with the end structures of mature nucleocapsids...|$|E
40|$|Clusters of closely spaced {{genes are}} {{frequently}} present in baculovirus genomes. We report here the detailed transcriptional mapping {{of one such}} gene cluster from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) comprising five ORFs, viz., Bm 42, Lef- 10, VP 1054, Bm 44, and Bm 45, which are closely spaced and transcribed in the same orientation. This region is homologous to ORFs 53, 53 a, 54, 55, and 56, respectively, on the AcMNPV genome. Multiple, overlapping sets of polycistronic transcripts from this region, that initiate independently but terminate at a common 3 ′ end, were detected following BmNPV infection. Expression of these genes followed a temporal pattern where the shorter transcripts initiating downstream appeared early, and with the progress of infection the longer transcripts initiated from upstream. The first ORF in this cluster, Bm 42, is conserved in almost all baculoviruses, but has not been characterized so far. The protein was localized in the cytosol, predominantly near the nucleus-cytoplasm boundary in BmNPV-infected BmN cells. Bm 42 was present in the budded virions and {{was not associated with}} <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> particles or the polyhedral matrix...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The Baculoviridae {{comprise}} {{a diverse group}} of <b>occluded</b> DNA <b>viruses</b> that contain large double-stranded DNA genomes of 80 - 180 kb and may encode up to 180 gene products. To understand how baculoviruses replicate and process their genomes and the gene products that are involved in these events, a series of mutant virus constructs were generated using the Autographa californica multinucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) genome propagated as a bacteria artificial chromosome (bacmid). The gene products investigated were very late expression factor- 1 (VLF- 1), DNA polymerase, alkaline nuclease, the single-stranded DNA binding protein (DBP), and those encoded from the open reading frames, Ac 101, Ac 142, and Ac 144. Using the Spodoptera frugiperda cell line as a tissue culture model system, bacmid constructs lacking any of the open reading frames encoding these seven gene products were shown to be non-infectious. In addition, based on a series of assays to determine the cause for the non-infectious phenotype, it was revealed that VLF- 1, a putative recombinase and transcriptional activator was also an essential structural component of the capsid and appeared to possess an enzymatic function related to its role as a recombinase during the final stages of DNA encapsidation. A bacmid lacking the alkaline nuclease gene was able to replicate DNA to normal levels, however, this construct produced aberrant genomes and defective nucleocapsids, suggesting that alkaline nuclease was involved in processing viral genomes during replication. Similarly, analysis of a bacmid lacking the single-stranded DNA binding protein DBP revealed that, although not absolutely required for DNA synthesis, DNA synthesis was reduced in the absence of DBP and no unit-length genomes could be detected from transfected cell extracts. Moreover, although not a structural component of budded virus, the DBP knockout was deficient in nucleocapsid production which is predicted to result from a defect in genome maturation. Finally, the gene products encoded by open reading frames Ac 101, Ac 142, and Ac 144, while expendable for DNA synthesis, were shown to be components of the nucleocapsid from budded virus, and bacmids lacking these gene products were deficient in nucleocapsid production...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear polyhedrosis virus infections of {{lepidopteran}} cells often {{result in}} the production of both <b>occluded</b> and nonoccluded <b>virus.</b> The characterization of these two different forms {{has been the subject of}} several papers. We have divided the nonoccluded virus (NOV) category further into plasma membrane-budded non-occluded virus (PMB-NOV), intracellular NOV, and hemolymph-derived NOV, and have done additional studies investigating the differences between these nonoccluded forms and the alkali-liberated forms from occlusions of the nuclear polyhedrosis viruses of Autographa californica and Rachiplusa ou. The methods used to discern differences and similarities among the forms were serological, biochemical, and visual, all related to their biological acitivity. Neutralization studies revealed that alkali-liberated virus and PMB-NOV had both similar and different antigens. Antisera raised against alkali-liberated virus from occlusions neutralized the alkali-liberated form of the virus, but did not neutralize the intracellular or extracellular nonoccluded forms. Antisera raised against the TN- 368 - 13 PMB-NOV, however, neutralized the alkali-liberated forms as well as all forms of the NOV. Adsorption of this antisera with alkali-liberated virus did not diminish the neutralization titer against the nonoccluded forms, thus confirming the antigenic differences between the alkali-liberated and nonoccluded forms of the virus. Physical-infectious particle ratio calculations indicated that the PMB-NOV of Autographa californica are about 1, 900 -fold more infectious than the single-nucleocapsid-per-envelope alkali-liberated particles and about 1, 700 -fold more infectious than the multiple-nucleocapsid-per-envelope particles, as assayed in vitro. In addition, a study of viral growth kinetics monitored concurrently with the appearance of polyhedra showed that PMB-NOV production is shut down with the onset of polyhedron formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{hemagglutinin}} {{of influenza}} (fowl plague) virus was expressed in larvae of Heliothis virescens by using recombinant Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (AcNPV) as a vector. Animals were infected with the recombinant virus either by parenteral injection or by feeding. For oral uptake, recombinant <b>virus</b> <b>occluded</b> in polyhedra obtained from cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells after coinfection with authentic AcNPV was used. Immunohistological analyses of infected animals revealed that the hemagglutinin was expressed only in those tissues that are also permissive for the replication of authentic AcNPV. These tissues included hypodermis, fat body, and tracheal matrix. After oral infection, hemagglutinin was also detected in individual gut cells. The amount of hemagglutinin synthesized in larvae after parenteral infection was 0. 3 % of the total protein, compared with 5 % obtained in cultured insect cells. The hemagglutinin was transported to the cell surface and expressed in polarized cells only at the apical plasma membrane. It was processed by posttranslational proteolysis into the cleavage products HA 1 and HA 2. Oligosaccharides were attached by N-glycosidic linkages and were smaller than those found on hemagglutinin obtained from vertebrate cells. Hemagglutinin from larvae expressed receptor binding and cell fusion activities, but quantitation of the hemolytic capacity revealed {{that it was only}} about half as active as hemagglutinin from vertebrate or insect cell cultures. Chickens immunized with larval tissues containing hemagglutinin were protected from infection with fowl plague virus.

In {{sharp contrast to}} natural infection, cadavers did not melt, liquefy and melanize. Typical morphological changes of apoptosis in insect haemocytes post-infection, including blebbing of the cell surface, chromatin margination and condensation, vacuolization of the cytoplasm and formation of apoptotic bodies, were observed by light and electron microscopy. Total DNAs extracted from virus-infected haemocytes showed DNA ladders. Cleavage of chromatin DNA by endogenous endonucleases were detected in the cells of most tissues cells, including epithelial cells and fat body cells, using terminal dUTP nick end labelling assays. Virogenic stroma and viral nucleocapsids {{could be seen in}} the nuclei of a few haemocytes. Yields of BV and OV (<b>occluded</b> <b>virus)</b> produced from the infected S. litura larvae were much lower than from the infected S. exigua larvae.

Particle-infectious unit calculations gave a ratio of 62 to 310 nonoccluded virus particles TCID 5 0. Growth cycle and lateral transmission experiments indicated that infectious material was released from cells 12 h postinfection (p. i.) and approached a maximal titer 4 days p. i. The number of polyhedra, nonoccluded virions, and TCID 5 0 produced per cell was also presented.

The production {{of large numbers of}} virions and inclusion bodies and their arrangement into paracrystalline arrays gives the gut of infected insects a distinctive blue iridescence. The virions, which were examined by electron microscopy, are icosahedral (55 to 65 nm in diameter) with a central core that is surrounded by a single capsid layer. They are usually packaged individually within cubic inclusion bodies (polyhedra, ∼ 100 nm across), although two to eight virus particles were sometimes <b>occluded</b> together. The <b>virus</b> was experimentally transmitted per os to several mosquito species. The transmission rate was enhanced by the presence of magnesium ions but was inhibited by calcium ions. Most of the infected larvae survived to adulthood, and the adults retained the infection. Electrophoretic analysis of the UsCPV genome segments (using 1 % agarose gels) generated a migration pattern (electropherotype) that is {{different from those of the}} 16 Cypovirus species already recognized. UsCPV genome segment 10 (Seg- 10) showed no significant nucleotide sequence similarity to the corresponding segment of the other cypoviruses that have previously been analyzed, and it has different “conserved” termini. A BLAST search of the UsCPV deduced amino acid sequence also showed little similarity to Antheraea mylitta CPV- 4 (67 of 290 [23 %]) or Choristoneura fumiferana CPV- 16 (33 of 111 [29 %]).

40|$|Silkworm {{jaundice}} {{virus is}} stable only between pH 5 and about pH 9. The fact that polyhedral bodies retain virus activity after exposure to hydrogen ion concentrations {{as high as}} pH 2 is regarded as being due {{to the protection of}} <b>virus</b> <b>occluded</b> within the bodies. Further evidence on this point is furnished by experiments on the activity of the polyhedra when treated with antiformin-formalin and when treated with 1 per cent sodium dodecyl sulfate. Free jaundice virus is inactivated by 36 per cent urea, 36 per cent guanidine, or 1 per cent sodium dodecyl sulfate. A purified preparation, active at a concentration of 10 – 12 gm. per cc., consisting essentially of a nucleoprotein component having a sedimentation constant of 17 S, a particle diameter of 10 mµ, and a molecular weight of about 300, 000, was obtained from the polyhedra-free blood of jaundiced silkworms. However, a component having a sedimentation constant of 16 S was demonstrated in the blood of normal worms. This component, the material from diseased blood, and polyhedral bodies, were found to contain serologically related material. Absorption of material from diseased blood with antiserum induced by a preparation from normal blood yielded a substance having a sedimentation constant of 17 S, which reacted strongly only with antiserum to material from diseased blood. This fact, and especially the fact that the inoculation of normal blood does not produce jaundice, demonstrates that a difference must exist between the purified material from diseased worms and that from normal ones. Chemical analyses of the purified virus material and of the polyhedral bodies also showed certain differences, although both probably represent nucleoproteins. Examination by means of the electron microscope showed further differences...|$|R

Reduction of infectivity of BV in the haemocoel by the monoclonal antibody AcV 1 to a level comparable to LOVAL clearly implicates its target, a 64 K phosphoglycoprotein abundant in the BV envelope but not detected in LOVAL, as being involved in BV's greater infectivity in that location. Homologous antiserum reduces the infectivity of LOVAL in the gut o that of LOVAL in the haemocoel, suggesting an analogous envelope component may account for its greater infectivity in the gut. Two phenotypes of Autographa ealiJbrn&a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) are involved in causing disease in susceptible lepidopteran hosts.

The deletion was characterized and the equivalent DNA fragment on the wild-type virus was sequenced. By co-transfecting the DNA of the deleted virus with plasmids derived from the wild-type virus, {{it was possible to}} determine that ORF 7 in this fragment is responsible for the observed phenotype. ORF 7, called pif (per os infectivity factor), is homologous to ORF 119 of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus. Similar ORFs are present in all sequenced baculoviruses.

40|$|The {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} DNAs {{characterized}} {{and compared}} in this study consist of the singly-enveloped nucleocapsids (SNPV) of Trichoplusia ni and the bundles of nucleocapsids common to a single envelope (MNPV) from Spodoptera frugiperda and Rachiplusia ou. The SNPV and MNPV DNAs are very similar in hydrodynamic properties and molecular weights. In addition, the NPV DNAs are similar in size to those extracted from the granulosis viruses that infect T. ni and S. frugiperda. As isolated from purified virus or directly from <b>occluded</b> <b>virus,</b> the nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNAs consist of a mixture of about 20 to 30 % double-stranded covalently closed molecules and approximately 60 % relaxed circles, with less than 10 % in linear duplex form. The molecular weights of all nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNAs as compared {{in this study are}} slightly smaller than those of T 4 bacteriophage DNA and perhaps slightly smaller than those of the granulosis virus DNAs. The best estimates of these molecular weights by neutral sucrose sedimentation for the nuclear polyhedrosis viruses range from 90 to 100 × 106 relative to a size of 108 × 106 for T 4 DNA. The base compositions of the nuclear polyhedrosis viruses that infect T. ni and S. frugiperda are compared with the respective insect host DNAs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAutographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (AcMNPV) {{potentially}} encodes a 215 -amino acid polypeptide containing 6 out of 11 motifs conserved among eukaryotic protein kinases (Morris et al., Virology 200, 360 – 369, 1994). We {{examined the}} expression of this gene, named pk 2, at the transcriptional and translational levels and the possible role of the gene during baculovirus replication in cell culture and insect larvae. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that pk 2 was transcribed primarily as an early 1. 2 -kb RNA. Western blot analysis showed that pk 2 was expressed as a 25 -kDa protein, PK 2, which was present both early and late during virus infection. To examine the function(s) of pk 2, we constructed a mutant baculovirus, vKINdel, in which one-third of the PK 2 -coding region was deleted and then compared the characteristics of vKINdel with wild-type AcMNPV and a marker-rescued revertant. The pk 2 deletion mutation had no discernable effect on the number, size, or appearance of plaques, the kinetics of protein synthesis or protein phosphorylation profiles during virus infection of cultured SF- 21 cells. Deletion of pk 2 also had no significant influence on the infectivity or virulence of the baculovirus in larval bioassays {{and the level of}} <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> production was normal. Thus, pk 2 {{does not appear to have}} a significant influence on virus replication in the host systems examined...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} a gene required for strong expression of the polyhedrin gene by characterizing a mutant, tsB 837, of the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) which is temperature sensitive (ts) for <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> production at the nonpermissive temperature. Marker rescue experiments utilizing an overlapping set of AcMNPV genomic clones revealed that the gene responsible for the ts mutant phenotype mapped to a region between 46 and 48 map units. Fragments (2. 2 kb) from both wild-type AcMNPV and tsB 837 genomes spanning the mutated region were sequenced, and a single nucleotide difference was observed. This mutation is predicted to substitute a single amino acid within a 44. 4 -kDa polypeptide. Analysis of protein synthesis in wild-type- and mutant-infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature indicated that polyhedrin synthesis was dramatically reduced in the mutant. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that the mutant had markedly reduced levels of polyhedrin transcripts. Transcripts of another very late gene, p 10, were also reduced but to a lesser degree. The transcription of two late genes (603 ORF and vp 39) was neither reduced nor temporally delayed. Thus, the gene encoding this very late expression factor, designated vlf- 1, regulates the levels of very late gene transcripts, and the tsB 837 mutation affects the levels of polyhedrin gene transcripts more strongly than those of p 10 transcripts. The product of the newly identified gene has a surprising but significant relationship to a family of integrases and resolvases...|$|E
40|$|The open {{reading frame}} Ha 107 of Helicoverpa armigera single nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) encodes a {{putative}} protein of 51 kDa with homologues in a few group II NPVs and a granulovirus. Ha 107 was transcribed as polyadenylated transcripts in infected HzAM 1 insect cells. The transcripts were initiated at two distinct locations, one upstream of Ha 106 (superoxide dismutase gene, sod) and the second upstream of Ha 107. By Western blot analysis, two forms of the HA 107 protein were detected in infected cells, a major polypeptide of 48 kDa and a minor one of 51 kDa. Western blot and immunoelectron microscopy analyses further showed that the HA 107 protein {{was associated with the}} nucleocapsids of both budded virions (BVs) and occlusion-derived virions. A Ha 107 knockout virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein and polyhedrin was constructed using bacmid technology. A one-step virus growth curve indicated that the BV titre of the knockout virus was significantly higher than that of the parental virus and a Ha 107 repair virus. Bioassays indicated that the knockout virus was able to infect third-instar H. armigera larvae; however, its median lethal dose (LD 50) was significantly higher than those of the parental virus and Ha 107 repair virus. These data indicate that Ha 107 encodes a non-essential structural protein of HearNPV virions and that deletion of this gene increases the BV titre and LD 50 of the <b>occluded</b> <b>virus...</b>|$|E
40|$|Low-cost, {{large-scale}} {{production of the}} baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) using continuous insect cell culture is seriously hindered by the accumulation of AcMNPV mutants. Specifically, few-polyhedra (FP) mutants, with a reduced yield of <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> (polyhedra) and decreased infectivity, usually accumulate upon passaging in cell culture. FP mutations result from transposon insertions in the baculovirus fp 25 k gene, leading to significantly reduced levels of FP 25 K protein synthesis. This study evaluated the effects of removing the transposon insertion sites from the wild-type baculovirus fp 25 k gene; the mutated virus was denoted Ac-FPm. Specifically, this study involved a detailed comparison of wild-type (WT) AcMNPV and Ac-FPm {{with regard to the}} proportion of cells having polyhedra, number of polyhedra per cell, the fraction of empty polyhedra, number of occlusion-derived viruses per polyhedron, number of nucleocapsids in the nuclei, FP 25 K protein synthesis and genetic analysis of the fp 25 k gene. Removal of TTAA transposon insertion sites from the fp 25 k gene stabilized FP 25 K protein synthesis and delayed the appearance of the FP phenotype from passage 5 to passage 10. Electron micrographs revealed that more virus particles were found inside the nuclei of cells infected with Ac-FPm than in the nuclei of cells infected with WT AcMNPV (at passage 10). Abnormalities, however, were observed in envelopment of nucleocapsids and virus particle occlusion within Ac-FPm polyhedra. Thus, the FP phenotype appeared in spite of continued FP 25 K protein synthesis, suggesting that mechanisms other than fp 25 k gene disruption can lead to the FP phenotype...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{identifies}} two structural proteins of the occluded derived {{viral envelope}} ofAutographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) : ODV-E 18 and ODV-E 35. In addition, we identify a protein, ODV-EC 27, that is {{incorporated into the}} capsid of <b>occluded</b> <b>virus,</b> which is not detected in budded virus. The genes for these proteins reside within the IE 0 intron. The intron was sequenced, and five open reading frames (ORF) were identified. ORF 3 (genomic ORF 143) codes for the ODV envelope protein, ODV-E 18. ORF 4 (genomic ORF 144) codes for ODV-EC 27, and Western blot analyses locate this protein to both the ODV capsid and envelope. Transcripts for both ODV-E 18 and ODV-EC 27 initiate from conserved TAAG motifs, and transcripts are detected from 16 through 72 hr p. i. Antiserum to ODV-E 18 recognizes a band of 18 kDa on Western blots of extracts from infected cells and bands of 18 and 35 kDa on Western blots of proteins from purified ODV envelope. N-terminal amino acid sequencing reveals that both ODV-E 18 and ODV-E 35 contain the same N-terminus. Antiserum to ODV-EC 27 recognizes a protein of 27 kDa on Western blots of extracts from infected cells and bands of 27 and 35 kDa on Western blots of proteins from purified ODV. Using immunogold labeling techniques, ODV-E 18 and/or ODV-E 35 are detected in viral induced intranuclear microvesicles and are not detected in the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic membranes, or the nuclear envelope. Immunogold labeling using antisera to ODV-EC 27 detects this protein on both the ODV envelope and capsid...|$|E
40|$|Previous reports {{indicate}} that mutations within the Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrosis virus FP 25 K gene (open reading frame 61) significantly reduce incorporation of enveloped nucleocapsids into viral occlu-sions. We report that FP 25 K is a nucleocapsid protein of both the budded virus (BV) and <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> (ODV), and we describe the effects of two FP 25 K mutations (480 - 1 [N-terminal truncation] and FP-bgal [C-terminal fu-sion]) on the expression and cellular localization of ODV-E 66 and ODV-E 25. Significantly decreased amounts of ODV-E 66 are detected in cells infected with 480 - 1 or FP-bgal viral mutants, even though during FP-bgal infection, steady-state levels of ODV-E 66 transcripts remain unchanged. While ODV-E 66 is normally detected in intranuclear microvesicles and ODV envelopes by 24 h postinfection (p. i.), ODV-E 66 remains cytosolic throughout infection in cells infected with 480 - 1 virus (up to 96 h p. i.), and its intranuclear localization is not detected until 96 h p. i. in cells infected with the FP-bgal mutant virus. The nuclear localization of ODV-E 25 is not affected during infection by the FP-bgal mutant; however, its trafficking is significantly delayed during infection by the 480 - 1 mutant. Temporal Western blot analyses of cell lysates show that both 480 - 1 and FP-bgal mutant virus infections result in altered accumulation patterns of several structural proteins, including gp 67, BV/ODV-E 26, and the major capsid protein p 39. In addition to BV/ODV-E 26, ODV-E 66 and gp 67 may interact with FP 25 K, and ODV-E 25 and p 39 may also be components of a protein complex containing ODV-E 66 an...|$|E
40|$|Immediate early {{viral protein}} IE 1 {{is a potent}} {{transcriptional}} activator encoded by baculoviruses. Although the requirement of IE 1 for multiplication of Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is well established, the functional roles of IE 1 during infection are unclear. Here, we used RNA interference to ablate IE 1, plus its splice variant IE 0, and thereby define in vivo activities of these early proteins, including gene-specific regulation and induction of host cell apoptosis. Confirming an essential replicative role, simultaneous ablation of IE 1 and IE 0 by gene-specific double-stranded RNAs inhibited AcMNPV late gene expression, reduced yields of budded virus by more than 1, 000 -fold, and blocked production of <b>occluded</b> <b>virus</b> particles. Depletion of IE 1 and IE 0 {{had no effect on}} early expression of the envelope fusion protein gene gp 64 but abolished early expression of the caspase inhibitor gene p 35, which is required for prevention of virus-induced apoptosis. Thus, IE 1 is a positive, gene-specific transactivator. Whereas an AcMNPV p 35 deletion mutant caused widespread apoptosis in permissive Spodoptera frugiperda cells, ablation of IE 1 and IE 0 prevented this apoptosis. Silencing of ie- 1 also prevented AcMNPV-induced apoptosis in nonpermissive Drosophila melanogaster cells. Thus, de novo synthesis of IE 1 is required for virus-induced apoptosis. We concluded that IE 1 causes apoptosis directly or contributes indirectly by promoting virus replication events that subsequently trigger cell death. This study reveals that IE 1 is a gene-selective transcriptional activator which is required not only for expedition of virus multiplication but also for blocking of its own proapoptotic activity by upregulation of baculovirus apoptotic suppressors...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} activity and genomic variation of five Kenyan, three Asian and two sublethal isolates of Plutella xylostella granulovirus (PlxyGV) were determined and compared in P. xylostella larvae reared on artificial diet. Optimal production of PlxyGV occlusion bodies (<b>occluded</b> <b>virus,</b> OB) {{was observed in}} larvae reared in isolation rather than communally. Incorporation of a juvenile hormone analogue in the artificial diet increased OB production seven times. The pathogenicity and infectivity of the isolates was compared using neonate P. xylostella. A single Kenyan isolate (PlxyGV- 2. 18) was shown to have a significantly shorter median lethal time to death (LT 50) than the other nine isolates in other geographical populations of P. xylostella. No synergism was observed between the isolates in mixed inoculations of P. xylostella and a slower killing isolate predominated over a faster killing isolate in mixed inoculations. The presence and nature of “sub-lethal” infections of PlxyGV observed in stock cultures of P. xylostella collected in Kenya and England was studied. Sub-lethal infections were observed in approximately 23 % of apparently healthy stock larvae from two of the stocks of P. xylostella (one from England and one from Kenya) but was absent from a third stock originating in England. It was possible to isolate OBs from apparently healthy P. xylostella larvae in the two virus positive stocks, indicating some productive infection. The sub-lethal isolates had similar pathogenicity and infectivity to the other Kenyan and Asian isolates (excluding PlxyGV- 2. 18). The genomes of the isolates were compared by restriction fragment length profiling and by sequencing specific regions of the viral genome.

40|$|The {{infectivity}} of Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} mutants {{lacking the}} apoptosis-inhibiting gene p 35 is decreased 1, 000 -fold or more in larvae of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda if the budded form of the virus is administered by hemocoelic injection; this decrease is correlated with the antiviral effects of apoptosis (R. J. Clem and L. K. Miller, J. Virol. 67 : 3730 - 3738, 1993). We have extended this correlation by showing that the infectivity of p 35 mutant budded virus is restored to wild-type levels by expression of an unrelated baculovirus apoptosis-inhibiting gene, Cp-iap. We have also examined the oral infectivity of the occluded form of mutants lacking p 35, the neighboring p 94 gene, or both genes by feeding insects <b>occluded</b> <b>virus.</b> The oral infectivity of the p 35 mutant was significantly reduced in S. frugiperda larvae, but this reduction (25 -fold) was less than that observed for the hemocoelic route of infection (1, 000 -fold). The disruption of p 94 alone had no apparent effect on infectivity by either route. Unexpectedly, however, the disruption of both p 35 and p 94 restored oral infectivity to nearly wild-type levels but did not exert this compensatory effect on infectivity by hemocoelic injection. Thus, the infectivity of the double p 35 /p 94 mutant is affected in a route-specific manner in S. frugiperda larvae, suggesting a tissue-specific response to p 35 and/or p 94. Infectivity in a different host, Trichoplusia ni, was unaffected by all the mutants tested, consistent with previous studies indicating a lack of sensitivity to apoptosis in this species. However, T. ni and S. frugiperda larvae infected with p 35 mutants failed to exhibit the symptom of morphological disintegration ("melting") typical of a wild-type infection, suggesting that p 35 {{is required for the}} infection of some tissues in both species...|$|E
