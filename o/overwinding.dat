40|$|The {{geometrical}} coupling between {{strain and}} twist in double helices is investigated. <b>Overwinding,</b> where strain leads to further winding, {{is shown to}} be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle (39. 4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is the unique pitch angle at the point between <b>overwinding</b> and unwinding, and it is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests the existence of zero-twist structures, i. e. structures that display neither <b>overwinding,</b> nor unwinding under strain.

50|$|As {{long as the}} {{mainspring}} is {{less than}} fully wound, the bridle holds the mainspring by friction to the barrel wall, allowing the mainspring to be wound. When the mainspring reaches full wind, its force is stronger than the bridle spring, and further winding pulls the bridle loose from the notches and it simply slides along the wall, preventing the mainspring from being wound further. The bridle must grip the barrel wall {{with just the right}} force to allow the mainspring to wind fully but not <b>overwind.</b> If it grips too loosely, the bridle will begin to slip before the mainspring is fully wound, a defect known as 'mainspring creep' which results in a shortened reserve power time.|$|R

The winding resulted in a bimodal state simultaneously including local structural failure and B-form DNA for both underwinding and extreme <b>overwinding.</b> Our simulations suggest that base flipping and local denaturation may provide a landscape influencing protein recognition of DNA sequence to affect, for examples, replication, transcription and recombination. Additionally, our findings help explain results from single-molecule experiments and demonstrate that elastic rod models are strictly valid on average only for unstressed or overwound DNA up to P-DNA formation.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{problems in}} the statics and traveling wave propagation on uniform elastic rods with constant curvature and torsion, i. e. a straight rod and a helical rod. The first set of problems concerns planar traveling loop-like waves on intrinsically straight rods.

Next, the effect of heterogeneity in the material properties on {{the shape of the}} loop is examined using a homogenization method. The second set of problems deals with a system consisting of a helical spring with a force and a torque applied along the helix axis. First, an overview is presented of problems of finding the stresses given the strains, or vice-versa, assuming that the elastic parameters of the spring are known. Then, the inverse problem is examined, where both stresses and strains are measured, and optimal elastic parameters within the linear consitutive model are sought. Various forms of measured strains are considered. Finally, the special problem with zero axial torque is considered, and criteria when the spring <b>overwinds</b> with a tensile axial force applied are established...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{supercoiling}} is {{a fundamental}} biological process occurring in all cells. We developed a theory of braiding (supercoiling) {{of a pair of}} DNA molecules that takes into account the contribution of the bending and the electrostatic energy. The electrostatic interaction was calculated {{within the framework of the}} Kornyshev-Leikin theory of DNA interactions, which takes into account realistic helical patterns of charge. Because of the chirality of the charge patterns, we predict that left-handed braiding of a pair of DNA molecules is more favourable than right-handed braiding. Applying our model to the case of closed loop DNA supercoiling and to single molecule DNA micromanipulations, we predict novel effects that have not yet been experimentally observed. We show that supercoiling may occur in topologically relaxed plasmids, as a consequence of attractive chiral forces. We speculate about the potential biological role of the predicted effects in the case of topoisomerase action, and the occurrence of positively supercoiled DNA in hyperthermophilic bacteria and archea. Our findings also suggest alternative an explanation of well-known experiments that proved that divalent ions <b>overwind</b> DNA. We also give an explanation for pairing of homologous DNA molecules in monovalent salt, and explain the occurrence of tight supercoiling observed in cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy. The analysis of existing experimental data shows that in most cases the chiral effects that we predict remain elusive. The theory therefore awaits final experimental verification.

40|$|The {{compaction}} of chromatin {{that occurs}} when cells enter mitosis {{is probably the most}} iconic process of dividing cells.

At present, understanding of the molecular events required to convert interphase chromatin into mitotic chromosomes is limited. Here, we review recent advances in the field, focusing on potential chromosomal compaction mechanisms and their importance to chromosome segregation. We propose a model of how metaphase chromosomes could be shaped based on the enzymatic activities of condensin and topoisomerase II in <b>overwinding</b> and relaxation of the DNA fiber during mitosis.

40|$|The topological {{state of}} DNA in hyperthermophilic archaea appears to {{correspond}} to a linking excess in comparison with DNA in mesophilic organisms. Since DNA binding proteins often contribute to the control of DNA topology by affecting DNA geometry {{in the presence of}} DNA topoisomerases, we tested whether the histone-like protein Sso 7 d from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus alters DNA conformation. In ligase-mediated supercoiling assays carried out at 37, 60, 70, 80 and 90 degrees C we found that DNA binding of increasing amounts of Sso 7 d led to a progressive decrease in plasmid linking number (Lk), producing negative supercoiling. Identical unwinding effects were observed when recombinant non-methylated Sso 7 d was used. For a given Sso 7 d concentration the DNA unwinding induced was augmented with increasing temperature. However, after correction for the <b>overwinding</b> effect of high temperature on DNA, plasmids ligated at 60 - 90 degrees C exhibited similar sigma values at the highest Sso 7 d concentrations assayed. These results suggest that Sso 7 d may play a compensatory role in vivo by counteracting the <b>overwinding</b> effect of high temperature on DNA. Additionally, Sso 7 d unwinding could be involved in the topological changes observed during thermal stress (heat and cold shock), playing an analogous role in crenarchaeal cells to that proposed for HU in bacteria...|$|E
