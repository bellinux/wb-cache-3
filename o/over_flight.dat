5|$|The AH-64E Apache has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches can request to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes <b>over</b> <b>flight</b> control. UAVs can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} I./JG21 {{was ordered to}} the coastal area of the English Channel the Gruppe was redesignated III./Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG54). Ostermann's third aerial victory on 12August 1940 may have been <b>over</b> <b>Flight</b> Lieutenant E.B.B. Smith of No. 610 Squadron RAF, who bailed out of his Supermarine Spitfire I K9818. Smith was rescued from the Channel and hospitalized. On 8October 1940 Ostermann claimed his 7th aerial victory {{of the war and}} 5th of the Battle of Britain. His {{opponent}} may have been the Czech Sergeant Josef František who was killed flying Hurricane Mk. I R4175 from No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron near Sutton, west of Croydon, in the southern outskirts of London that day. The reason for his fatal crash remains unclear. Apart from Ostermann's claim, Leutnant (Second Lieutenant) Max Clerico and Feldwebel (Sergeant) Fritz Oeltjens also claimed one aircraft each {{at the same time and}} in the same vicinity. On 5September 1940, III./JG54's Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) failed to return from a mission and Geschwaderkommodore Hannes Trautloft temporarily appointed Oberleutnant Günther Scholz to lead the Gruppe. The leadership of 7. Staffel (7th squadron) was filled by Oberleutnant Hans-Ekkehard Bob, who became one of Ostermann's mentors. During an escort mission on 30September 1940, Bob and Ostermann claimed one Spitfire shot down each. In return Ostermann's wingman was shot down and made a forced landing at Bexhill. He radioed his fellow pilots: [...] "Spinat vier meldet sich ab nach Kanada—Spinach 4 reports off for Canada".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control <b>over</b> <b>flight</b> or to ease the workload. [...] The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot {{does not have to}} maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitude (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). [...] Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. [...] Other secondary flight control systems may be available, including slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings.|$|E

50|$|The NTSB also {{determined}} that the first officer's poor performance during takeoff had likely contributed to his loss of control of the airplane. The first officer rotated the airplane at more than 6 degrees per second, or twice the recommended rate.
