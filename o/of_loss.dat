Based on data that {{released}} in 2009 by Directorate General of Housing Ministry of Public Works Republic of Indonesia, the rate <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water at national level have reached 37 %. This figure has much influence {{to the ability of}} MW to supply water to the consumers. The more <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water occur, the more the ability of MW to supply water slackens. The objective of this research is to make model <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water as well as to know about the volume <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water. WB-EasyCalc 1. 07 software was used to analyze model. Analysis has been done by reading the graph of water balance resulted from the model. In addition, the ratio between value of non-revenue water that available in the past and reliable field data has also needed. Field data was taken from observation and by using questioner method, where as respondent was the technician of MW and the consumers. The result of the model was a water balance. Based on 2009 water balance, Semarang has 57. 4 % non-revenue water and <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water were 30. 55 % and represent the higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> water.

5|$|A {{major problem}} was that <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|All kanyas lack {{mothers in}} their life. Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari, Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births, while Kunti is adopted at birth and {{separated}} from a mother. Though all of kanyas {{are described as}} mothers, except Kunti, no kanya's motherhood is emphasized in their tales. Another common element is the theme <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> in their legends. Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family. Tara loses her husband, Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband, sons and kin in war. Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men, but battles on with life and society. They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth-making, however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message. A free-spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery. Druapadi, who challenges and mocks even her husbands, has her dignity repeatedly violated by men.|$|E
