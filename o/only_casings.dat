50|$|Miu's Machina is the pink, mid-to-long range support Mecha Painkiller, {{equipped}} with throwing knives and two beam rifles on each arm.

40|$|Thermal {{recovery}} processes, such as cyclic steam stimulation {{and steam}} assisted gravity drainage, involve the injection of {{large volumes of}} steam into oil sand formations. Dilatation of oil sand formations due to steam injection induces stresses and deformations in the shale overburden. Natural horizontal fissures or extensive fractures with no tensile and cohesive strength are commonly found in the shale formation. New fractures will be initiated at these in situ horizontal fracture tips if the stresses and deformation induced by the steam injection are excessive. Reactivation and propagation of these in situ fractures in the shale formation could not <b>only</b> cause <b>casing</b> impairment problems, but could also cause an environmental hazard. This paper presents an analytical model to investigate the propensity for fracture propagation in shale due to steam injection under tensile (mode I) and shear (model II) fracturing. Practical numerical examples are presented along with a risk assessment and implications. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Eighty-one {{water samples}} were {{collected}} from wells in the Boone-St. Joe limestone aquifer of northwest Arkansas and analyzed for fecal coliform, fecal streptococcus, total coliform bacteria, chloride, phosphate, nitrate and sulfate to determine the degree of contamination. Forty-nine percent of the samples had fecal streptococcus counts greater than 1 colony per 100 ml, 68 % had total coliform counts of 1 or more colonies per 100 ml, and 9 % of the wells had fecal coliform counts of 1 or more colonies per 100 ml. Water from wells in Clarksville, Nixa, Noark, Tonti and Waben cherty silt loam soils showed from 83 to 100 % bacterial contamination. Nitrate concentrations exceeded 45 ppm in 80 % of the wells in Waben soils and in 50 % of wells in Nixa soils, with wells in the other soil types having nitrate concentrations of less than 45 ppm. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride concentrations were all found to be statistically related. Wells closest to chicken houses {{were found to have}} statistically greater choloride concentrations. Chloride was also found to be statistically greater in wells with shallow casing. Wells within 150 meters of a photo-lineament were found to have greater fecal coliform contamination than wells farther away.

40|$|We have {{designed}} and built a compact breadboard prototype instrument called WatSen: a combined ATR mid-IR spectrometer, fixed-focus microscope, and humidity sensor. The instrument package is enclosed in a rugged cylindrical <b>casing</b> <b>only</b> 26 mm in diameter. The functionality, reliability and performance of the instrument was tested in an environment chamber set up to resemble martian surface conditions. The effective wavelength range of the spectrometer is 6. 2 - 10. 3 micron with a resolution delta-wavelength/wavelength = 0. 015. This allows detection of silicates and carbonates, including {{an indication of the}} presence of water (ice). Spectra of clusters of grains < 1 mm across were acquired that are comparable with spectra of the same material obtained using a commercial system.

40|$|In the Joint Construction Task two {{participants}} build a tangram figure together, copying {{an image}} on their screen. Participants are seated opposite to each other, {{both have a}} screen {{placed in front of}} them. Several rules are {{to be taken into account}} when building these tangram figures, to resemble joint construction as much as possible. One of these rules for example is that both participants are forced to hold tangram figure parts together, otherwise the parts will break. Two time conditions are measured: with time pressure and without time pressure. In the first condition, both participants have a fixed time interval to finish an image. A clock is shown on their screens that provides them exact information on how much time they have left to finish. In the without time pressure condition, a clock is presented as well, <b>only</b> in this <b>casing</b> time is going upward, without any consequences attached to the time needed to rebuild an image...|$|R
40|$|The turtle shell, an {{evolutionarily}} novel structure, is the <b>only</b> vertebrate <b>casing</b> made exclusively of bone. The {{mechanisms of}} shell development in turtle embryos {{have not been}} studied very extensively. Results {{presented in this paper}} suggest that the shell forms by co- opting existing developmental pathways. In situ hybridizations with antisense riboprobes derived from Trionyx spiniferous fibroblast growth factor-l 0 (fgflO) and Trachemys scripta fgf 8 were performed on sections of early T scripta embryos. fgflO expression was localized in the mesenchyme ofthe carapacial ridge (CR), which forms the dorsal part of the shell. In the chick limb bud, Fgf 10 is known to specify the limb-forming mesenchyme. Fgf 10 expression induces Fgf 8 expression in the ectoderm of the limb bud and causes limb outgrowth. The localization of fgf 10 in the CR supports the hypothesis that the early shell utilizes the same developmental pathway as the early limb. fgf 8 expression, however, was only found in the growing turtle limb, indicating that the pathway is not co-opted directly from the limb. Bone/cartilage staining with alizarin red/alcian blue indicated that ossification of the shell begins soon after hatching. In order to determine whether bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a role in shell ossification, whole-mount in situ hybridizations with recombinant human BMP 4 and BMP 2 antisense riboprobes were performed on T scripta hatchlings. The expression of BMP 4 in the ventral part of the shell and in ribs embedded in the dorsal part of the shell suggests that BMP 4 acts in shell dermis ossification...|$|R
40|$|Casing {{coupling}} location signals {{provided by}} the magnetic localizer in retractors are typically used to ascertain the position of casing couplings in horizontal wells. However, the casing coupling location signal is usually submerged in noise, which {{will result in the}} failure of casing coupling detection under the harsh logging environment conditions. The limitation of Shannon wavelet time entropy, in the feature extraction of casing status, is presented by analyzing its application mechanism, and a corresponding improved algorithm is subsequently proposed. On the basis of wavelet transform, two derivative algorithms, singular values decomposition and Tsallis entropy theory, are proposed and their physics meanings are researched. Meanwhile, a novel data mining approach to extract casing status features with Tsallis wavelet singularity entropy is put forward in this paper. The theoretical analysis and experiment results indicate that the proposed approach can not <b>only</b> extract the <b>casing</b> coupling features accurately, but also identify the characteristics of perforation and local corrosion in casings. The innovation of the paper is in the use of simple wavelet entropy algorithms to extract the complex nonlinear logging signal features of a horizontal well tractor...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{the case}} of {{continuous}} casting of metal ribbons with the melt-spinning process on the industrial scale, larger quantity of melt {{could lead to a}} slow excessive warming of the chilling wheel, which would further lead to solidification of a ribbon at non-uniform conditions and increased wearing of the wheel. Primary goal of our work was to determine to what extent the release of heat during contact of the melt/ribbon on the circumferential surface of the chilling wheel affect its surface temperature rise, and inversely how much elevated temperature of the chill wheel surface affects on metal ribbon cooling rate and its solidification velocity. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of developed mathematical model, a computer program was made and used for analyses of heat transfer in the melt-spinning process. Findings: The calculations show that contact resistance between metal melt and chilling wheel has a great influence on melt/ribbon cooling and chill wheel heating rate, and must not be neglected in numerical calculations, even if its value is very low. In {{the case of}} continuous casting, significant “long term” surface temperature increase may take place, if the wheel is not internally cooled. But inner cooling is effective <b>only</b> if wheel <b>casing</b> thickness is properly chosen. Research limitations/implications: Influence of process parameters and chill wheel cooling mode on cooling and solidifying rate over ribbon thickness are outlined. Practical implications: Directions for the chill wheel cooling system design are indicated. Originality/value: New method for determining contact resistance through variable heat transfer coefficient is introduced which takes into account physical properties of the casting material, process parameters and contact time/length between metal melt/ribbon and substrate and enables cooling rate prediction before the experiment execution. In the case of continuous casting, heat balance of the melt-spinning process is calculated and influence of the chill wheel cooling mode on cooling rate of metallic ribbon is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} how a rotor's unsteady tip clearance flow structure changes in a low speed one and half stage axial compressor when the rotor tip gap size is increased from 0. 5 mm (0. 49 % of rotor tip blade chord, 2 % of blade span) to 2. 4 mm (2. 34 % chord, 4 % span) at the design condition are investigated. The changes in unsteady tip clearance flow with the 0. 62 % tip gap as the flow rate is reduced to near stall condition are also investigated. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is applied to calculate the unsteady flow field at these three flow conditions. Detailed Stereoscopic PIV (SPIV) measurements of the current flow fields were also performed at the Johns Hopkins University in a refractive index-matched test facility which renders the compressor blades and casing optically transparent. With this setup, the unsteady velocity field in the entire flow domain, including the flow inside the tip gap, can be measured. Unsteady tip clearance flow fields from LES are compared with the PIV measurements and both LES and PIV results are used to study changes in tip clearance flow structures. The current study shows that the tip clearance vortex is not a single structure as traditionally perceived. The tip clearance vortex is formed by multiple interlaced vorticities. Therefore, the tip clearance vortex is inherently unsteady. The multiple interlaced vortices never roll up to form a single structure. When phased-averaged, the tip clearance vortex appears as a single structure. When flow rate is reduced with the same tip gap, the tip clearance vortex rolls further upstream and the tip clearance vortex moves further radially inward and away from the suction side of the blade. When the tip gap size is increased at the design flow condition, the overall tip clearance vortex becomes stronger and it stays closer to the blade suction side and the vortex core extends all the way to the exit of the blade passage. Measured and calculated unsteady flow fields inside the tip gap agree fairly well. Instantaneous velocity vectors inside the tip gap from both the PIV and LES do show flow separation and reattachment at the entrance of tip gap as some earlier studies suggested. This area at the entrance of tip gap flow (the pressure side of the blade) is confined very close to the rotor tip section. With a small tip gap (0. 5 mm), the gap flow looks like a simple two-dimensional channel flow with larger velocity near the casing for both flow rates. A small area with a sharp velocity gradient is observed just above the rotor tip. This strong shear layer is turned radially inward when it collides with the incoming flow and forms the core structure of the tip clearance vortex. When tip gap size is increased to 2. 4 mm at the design operation, the radial profile of the tip gap flow changes drastically. With the large tip gap, the gap flow looks like a two-dimensional channel flow <b>only</b> near the <b>casing.</b> Near the rotor top section, a bigger region with very large shear and reversed flow is observed...|$|R
