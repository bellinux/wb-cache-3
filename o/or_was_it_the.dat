Although initially disappointed that [...] "Miss Hepburn" [...] was not Katharine Hepburn as he had mistakenly thought, Givenchy and Hepburn formed a lifelong friendship. She became his muse, and the two became so closely associated with each other that academic Jayne Sheridan has stated [...] "we might ask 'Did Audrey Hepburn create Givenchy <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> other way around?'".|$|E
