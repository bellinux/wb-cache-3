25|$|Dispersion {{staining}} is {{an optical}} technique {{that results in}} a colored image of a colorless object. This is an <b>optical</b> <b>staining</b> technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce a color effect. There are five different microscope configurations used in the broader technique of dispersion staining. They include brightfield Becke line, oblique, darkfield, phase contrast, and objective stop dispersion staining.|$|E
50|$|The {{contrast}} can {{be adjusted}} using the offset phase, either by translating the objective Nomarski prism, or by a lambda/4 waveplate between polarizer and the condenser Normarski prism (De-Senarmont Compensation). The resulting contrast is going from dark-field for zero phase offset (intensity proportional to {{the square of the}} shear differential), to the typical relief seen for phase of ~5-90 degrees, to <b>optical</b> <b>staining</b> at 360 degrees, where the extinguished wavelength shifts with the phase differential.|$|E
50|$|The {{dispersion}} staining is an analytical technique used in light microscopy that {{takes advantage of}} the differences in the dispersion curve of the refractive index of an unknown material relative to a standard material with a known dispersion curve to identify or characterize that unknown material. These differences become manifest as a color when the two dispersion curves intersect for some visible wavelength. This is an <b>optical</b> <b>staining</b> technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce the color. Its primary use today is in the confirmation of the presence of asbestos in construction materials but it has many other applications.|$|E
40|$|A {{ubiquitous}} computing environment would capture {{a large amount}} of interaction histories of objects in the environment {{over a long period of}} time, such interaction histories serve as a valuable source of information for people to solve problems and make decisions in the present time. Our approach is to enrich the space by providing interaction history information through noticeable wear expressed within a physical environment. A History-Enriched Environment (HEE) allows people to use interaction histories of people, things, and places on demand, and to obtain relevant information by tracing links among objects. We argue that taking into account two aspects of people’s cognitive activities, situated encountering and information-triggered information needs, is a key to build an HEE.

40|$|The {{majority}} of wild felids, {{as well as}} some domestic cats, have low sperm concentration in their ejaculates, and a high proportion of abnormal spermatozoa. We have employed several possible semen quality markers to further characterize cat epididymal sperm. Methods included possible apoptotic reporters, such as the annexin V assay to monitor exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, as well as cell integrity; and the TUNEL assay to quantify DNA breaks. Sperm surface ubiquitination, another putative marker of sperm quality, was also monitored. The annexin V assay revealed a high percentage of sperm with PS exposure, and the TUNEL assay pointed to high levels (13  ±  12 %) of sperm with DNA breaks. Correlations were found between apoptotic markers (but not ubiquitination) and semen parameters. In parallel to this analysis, cat sperm morphology was evaluated using the Diff-Quik <b>optical</b> <b>stain,</b> which has been used in human reproduction laboratories. Several types of abnormalities could be characterized with this method. Remarkably, head staining abnormalities detected using the Diff-Quik staining method were strongly correlated with, and could accurately predict, sperm DNA defects detected in the same sample using the TUNEL assay. We therefore suggest that sperm morphology analysis using Diff-Quik could be used in field conditions to assess sperm status, due to the simplicity of the procedure and the equipment involved.

40|$|High-resolution ex vivo {{magnetic}} resonance microscopy (MRM) {{can be used}} to delineate prominent architectonic features in the human brain, but increased contrast is required to visualize more subtle distinctions. The goal of this thesis is to employ target-specific MR contrast agents to regionally alter relaxation rates, resulting in increased contrast in ex vivo MRM of the human brain, with the aim of providing richer information about cyto- and/or myelo-architechtonics than is currently achievable. To accomplish this goal, a traditional <b>optical</b> myelin <b>stain,</b> luxol fast blue (LFB) MBSN with a paramagnetic copper core, has been introduced as a white-matter-selective MR contrast agent in ex vivo brain tissue. The solution relaxivity of LFB was measured at high (4. 7 Tesla) and ultra-high (14 Tesla) field strengths. A methodology was developed for staining large tissue samples, enabling MR imaging.

Current assessments are performed manually and are subjective. Automated image analysis {{as described here}} objectively quantitates ER in breast cancer nuclei obtained by needle aspiration. ER was visualised by ERICA with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. Various indices of ER positivity were derived from the integrated density and average density measurements of nuclear DAB. Each index was compensated for background staining by non-specific antibody binding and endogenous peroxidase activity. Total nuclear ER content (integrated <b>optical</b> density of <b>stain)</b> was strongly associated with the biopsy ER concentration determined by saturation analysis of radioligand binding (DCC), P less than 0. 005. Nuclear ER concentration by image analysis (mean <b>optical</b> density of <b>stain)</b> {{was not associated with}} the DCC measurement of ER concentration, P greater than 0. 05.

X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm that the synthesized samples are montmorillonite-like phyllosilicates having the expected chemical composition. The specific surface areas of the samples are relatively large (> 100 m 2 g− 1) compared to naturally occurring montmorillonites. 29 Si and 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicate substitutions of Al for Si in the tetrahedral sheet. 19 F NMR and Ni K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) local probes highlight a clustering of the metal elements and of the vacancies in the octahedral sheet of the samples. These Ni-Al phyllosilicates exhibit a higher local order than in previously synthesized Zn-Al phyllosilicates. Unlike natural montmorillonites, where the distribution of transition metal cations ensures a charge equilibrium allowing a stability of the framework, synthetic montmorillonites entail clustering and instability of the lattice when the content of divalent element in the octahedral sheet exceeds ca. 20 %.

The cement is the material had chemically precipitated partial or totally pore filling, affecting rock values of porosity and permeability. The acknowledgment of diagenetic patterns those are associated to the carbonatic cement precipitation and their impacts in the reservoirs quality can decrease {{the risks of}} exploration and exploitation of new reservoirs. Therefore is necessary the knowledge of origin and processes of carbonate cement’s precipitation. These cements have distribution patterns, mineralogy, textures and isotopic compositions which vary spatial and temporally, depending of perform conditions in each diagenetic environment. One {{of the most important}} diagenetic cement is dolomite and the dolomite’s group is compound by dolomite and ankerite. These minerals can be differentiated by analytical techniques such as <b>optical</b> petrography, <b>staining</b> techniques, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy and isotopes.

Apparent inconsistencies between previously published light and electron microscopy studies of nuclear lamin staining were resolved. At light microscopy resolution, an apparent open fibrillar network is visualized. Colocalization of lamin B and nuclear pores demonstrates that these apparent fibrils, separated by roughly 0. 5 micron, are anti-correlated with the surface distribution of nuclear pores; pore clusters lie between or adjacent to regions of heavy lamin B staining. Examination at higher, EM resolution reveals that this apparent lamin B network does not correspond to an actual network of widely spaced, discrete bundles of lamin filaments. Rather it reflects a quantitative variation in lamin staining over a roughly 0. 5 -micron size scale, superimposed on a more continuous but still complex distribution of lamin filaments, spatially heterogeneous on a 0. 1 - 0. 2 -micron size scale. Interestingly, lamin B staining at this higher resolution is highly correlated to the underlying chromatin distribution.
