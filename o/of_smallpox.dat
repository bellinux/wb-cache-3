5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Complications <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> arise most {{commonly}} in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia.

5|$|The last cases <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> in {{the world}} {{occurred}} in an outbreak of two cases (one of which was fatal) in Birmingham, UK in 1978. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on September 11, 1978, after which Professor Henry Bedson, the scientist responsible for smallpox research at the university, committed suicide. All known stocks <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities—the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-18th century {{smallpox}} {{was a major}} {{endemic disease}} {{everywhere in the world}} except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year. Up to 10 percent of Swedish infants died <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> each year, and the death rate of infants in Russia may have been even higher. The widespread use of variolation in a few countries, notably Great Britain, its North American colonies, and China, somewhat reduced the impact <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> among the wealthy classes during {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century. Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much milder form <b>of</b> <b>smallpox,</b> variola minor, was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major, in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness, are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with v. minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form. Thus as v. minor spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form <b>of</b> <b>smallpox,</b> further reducing mortality rates.|$|E

5|$|No drug is {{currently}} approved {{for the treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>smallpox.</b> However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and {{studies suggest that the}} antiviral drug cidofovir might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered intravenously, however, and may cause serious kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E
5|$|The {{date of the}} {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> is not settled. It most likely evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago. The wide range of dates {{is due to the}} different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form <b>of</b> <b>smallpox)</b> which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago. A second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present. This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago. A second estimate has placed the separation of variola from Taterapox at 3000–4000 years ago. This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding {{the appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However, if the mutation rate is assumed to be {{similar to that of the}} herpesviruses, the divergence date between variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago. While this is consistent with the other published estimates, it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete. Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} credible {{clinical evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>smallpox</b> {{is found in}} the smallpox-like disease in medical writings from ancient India (as early as 1500 BC), Egyptian mummy of Ramses V who died more than 3000 years ago (1145 BC) and China (1122 BC). It has been speculated that Egyptian traders brought smallpox to India during the 1st millennium BC, where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least 2000 years. Smallpox was probably introduced into China during the 1st century AD from the southwest, and in the 6th century was carried from China to Japan. In Japan, the epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of the population. At least seven religious deities have been specifically dedicated to smallpox, such as the god Sopona in the Yoruba religion. In India, the Hindu goddess <b>of</b> <b>smallpox,</b> Sitala Mata, was worshiped in temples throughout the country.|$|E
