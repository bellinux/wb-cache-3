5|$|The {{exploits}} of the Brunswickers caught the British Victorian public's imagination: an example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in John Everett Millais's painting The Black Brunswicker. Completed in 1860, the painting depicts a Brunswicker {{in his black}} uniform bidding goodbye to an unnamed woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether birds should {{continue}} to be actively collected for research {{has been the subject of}} some debate among ornithologists (examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in the lively exchanges between Remsen and Bekoff & Elzanowski, between Vuilleumier and Donegan, and between Dubois & Nemesio and Donegan).|$|E

5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking {{a portion of the}} East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Les {{invented the}} flange effect, where a sound phases {{in and out}} in {{harmonic}} tone. The first example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> heard on his song, Mammy's Boogie.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{players have}} taken to placing water in cups in order to hold {{organized}} beer pong tournaments legally in bars. Some examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|The Oropouche virus also causes {{disruption}} in cultured cells – {{cells that are}} cultivated in distinct and specific conditions. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in HeLa cells, whereby the cells begin to degenerate shortly after they are infected.|$|E
25|$|Another long gap followed, {{though much}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{explained}} by Ireland not playing between 1915 and 1919 {{due to the}} First World War.

25|$|Baptized on 13 December 1752 at Gosport, Hampshire, Hackman {{was the son}} of William and Mary Hackman. His {{father had}} served in the Royal Navy as a lieutenant. Hackman was apprenticed to a mercer, and {{although}} according to some accounts he became a member of St John's College, Cambridge, no record <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced at Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, mixing starch into {{concentrated}} {{sulfuric acid}} will give elemental carbon and water as {{absorbed by the}} sulfuric acid (which becomes slightly diluted). The effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen when concentrated sulfuric acid is spilled on paper which is composed of cellulose; the cellulose reacts to give a burnt appearance, the carbon appears much as soot would in a fire.|$|E
25|$|Alkaline {{batteries}} {{are prone to}} leaking potassium hydroxide, a caustic agent that can cause respiratory, eye and skin irritation. Risk <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reduced by not attempting to recharge disposable alkaline cells, not mixing different battery types in the same device, replacing all of the batteries at the same time, storing in a dry place and at room temperature, and removing batteries for storage of devices.|$|E

25|$|B-modes {{are thought}} to be much fainter than E-modes, as they are formed by higher order effects. The ratio of the E-mode to B-mode {{polarization}} is currently unknown, and the minimum detectable value <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as a measure of the sensitivity of a CMB instrument. For QUIET this value is r=0.009, which corresponds to the energy scale of cosmic inflation being around nbsp&GeV.|$|E
25|$|Some Mayan monuments include glyphs {{that record}} an 819-day count in their Initial Series. These {{can also be}} found in the Dresden codex. This is {{described}} in Thompson. More examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in Kelley. Each group of 819 days was associated with one of four colors and the cardinal direction with which it was associated — black corresponded to west, red to east, white to north and yellow to south.|$|E
25|$|While colonial art {{remained}} {{almost completely}} European in style, with muted colors and {{no indication of}} movement—the addition of native elements, which began with the tequitqui, continued. They were never {{the center of the}} works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and cacao. Much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public.|$|E

25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect is}} {{an effect of}} finite {{deformation}} of non-linear elastic materials. A modern comprehensive account <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in. This book treats {{the application of the}} non-linear elasticity theory and the analysis of the mechanical properties of solid materials capable of large elastic deformations. The special case of the acoustoelastic theory for a compressible isotropic hyperelastic material, like polycrystalline steel, is reproduced and shown in this text from the non-linear elasticity theory as presented by Ogden.|$|E
25|$|Hooke and Wren both being keen astronomers, the Monument was {{designed}} to serve a scientific function as a telescope for observing transits, though Hooke's characteristically precise measurements after completion showed that {{the movement of the}} column in the wind made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed {{in the construction of the}} spiral staircase, which has no central column, and in the observation chamber which remains in place below ground level.|$|E
25|$|Eremitagesletten {{is an area}} in {{the north}} of the park.

Evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> clearly seen from the roads which are laid out in the classic star form that was typical for areas used in this form of hunting. In the middle of Eremitagesletten is the Hermitage, built during the reign of Christian VI.|$|E
