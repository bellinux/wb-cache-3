5|$|The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) ruled {{before the}} {{establishment}} of the Ming dynasty. Explanations for the demise of the Yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against Han Chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion, <b>overtaxation</b> of areas hard-hit by inflation, and massive flooding of the Yellow River {{as a result of the}} abandonment of irrigation projects. Consequently, agriculture and the economy were in shambles, and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River. A number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the Red Turbans in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the White Lotus, a Buddhist secret society. Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352; he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander. In 1356, Zhu's rebel force captured the city of Nanjing, which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty.|$|E

Although the rebellion is portrayed by many historians as a religious uprising, that ignores the issues of discontent from famine and <b>overtaxation.</b> Those affected also included fishermen, craftsmen and merchants. As the rebellion spread, it was joined by rōnin (masterless samurai) who once had served families, such as the Amakusa and Shiki, who had once lived in the area, as well as former Arima clan and Konishi retainers.

Conservative scholars and policymakers often attribute {{the prevalence of}} inequality and working poverty to overregulation and <b>overtaxation,</b> which they claim constricts job growth. In order to lower the rate of working poverty, conservatives advocate reducing welfare benefits and enacting less stringent labor laws. On the other hand, many liberals argue that working poverty can only be solved through increased, not decreased, government intervention. This government intervention could include workplace reforms (such as higher minimum wages, living wage laws, job training programs, etc.) {{and an increase in}} government transfers (such as housing, food, childcare, and healthcare subsidies).|$|E

In 1926 an Irish Senate debate included claims by some Senators that, with compound interest, Ireland was owed as much as £1.2 billion by Britain. This, however, ignored the changed economic conditions since 1894, and at the eve of secession Southern Ireland was being heavily subsidised by the British taxpayer. This economic reality forced the initial Irish Free State government to cut the old age pension from five to four shillings. In 1932 on {{the start of the}} Anglo-Irish Trade War, the Irish government made a claim for £400 million in respect of past <b>overtaxation,</b> amongst others, but this was not mentioned when the dispute was settled in 1938.|$|E
5000|$|Despite her {{stirring}} rhetoric, Griffitts, {{like many}} other Quakers of the period, was uneasy {{at the prospect of}} violence and supported a negotiated solution to <b>overtaxation</b> rather than outright revolution. After war broke out, she raged against radicals like Thomas Paine (calling him a [...] "Snake beneath the Grass" [...] in one of her poems) whose views had prevailed over those of the moderates. She refused to leave Philadelphia even after it was seized by the British, and she continued to maintain her antiwar stance. Although the neutralist American Quakers were sometimes seen as de facto Loyalists during the war, Griffitts was as quick to criticize the British as the Americans. For instance, she perceived the Mischianza—an elaborate fête that the British arranged in 1778 to honor General George Hewe on his departure for England—as an example of the degeneracy of British culture.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{commuting}} {{is introduced}} to a federal economy where benevolent lower-level (state) governments levy an ad valorem tax on labour income.

Distinguishing between the intensity of regulation, and the range of regulation, it is possible to show that a utility maximizing government has an incentive to overregulate both in the short and long run, but that there are definite limits to regulatory intensity.

40|$|In this paper, we model {{a federal}} economy where {{perfectly}} mobile labour supply is taxed on an ad valorem basis {{by the federal}} as well as lower-level (state) governments. We find that either under- or <b>overtaxation</b> occurs, under similar conditions as in Keen and Kotsogiannis (2002, 2004). However, the neat trade-off between positive horizontal externalities and negative vertical externalities breaks down entirely in our ad valorem setting. Precisely because of this ambiguity, decentralizing the unitary outcome via revenue equalisation becomes far more complex than under unit taxation. Only when the marginal valuation of public provision is on par with private consumption, can we replicate the clear-cut, efficiency-enhancing equalisation formulas given by Kotsogiannis (2010) and Bucovetsky and Smart (2006). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{commuting}} {{is introduced}} to a federal setting where an ad valorem residence based tax on labour income is decentralised. Under full decentralisation, this has lower-level (state) governments set inefficiently low taxes, even when households as a whole do not migrate. The motive of state governments is not to attract more workers, but to boost labour supply of own residents and hamper labour supplied by non-residents. When the labour tax base is co-occupied by {{the federal and state}} governments furthermore, either public under- or <b>overtaxation</b> may occur. Our model identifies clear conditions for states to overprovide, i. e. for the overall fiscal externality to be negative. Moreover, such a negative externality may arise even when the vertical as well as horizontal externalities are positive in isolation, and one would rather expect underprovision. Lastly, when states differ in terms of preferences and technology, an inflow of commuters makes it more likely for states to set taxes inefficiently low. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This Article advocates {{fundamental}} changes in the federal income tax base by systematically challenging conventional understandings of consumption and investment. As signaled by its title, “Costly Mistakes,” this Article 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{has to do with}} the disparate treatment of expenditures incurred by business owners and workers. Where the current tax law treats a business owner 2 ̆ 7 s expenditure as investment, the Article sometimes finds consumption and questions why the law should allow the expenditure to be deducted. Where the tax law treats a worker 2 ̆ 7 s expenditure as consumption, the Article sometimes finds investment and questions why the law does not allow at least a partial deduction. Through an historical analysis of the development of the modern tax law with special attention to Justice Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s 1933 U. S. Supreme Court opinion in Welch v. Helvering and a review of Welch 2 ̆ 7 s judicial and legislative progeny, the Article demonstrates that the deference the tax law traditionally has accorded business owners results in their undertaxation. Through an analysis of the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of workers, it further shows how its structural and substantive rules treat workers primarily as consumers, rather than as producers, and why that results in their <b>overtaxation.</b> The Article then investigates the economic inefficiencies produced by the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s generous treatment of business owners 2 ̆ 7 outlays and its unduly restrictive treatment of workers 2 ̆ 7 outlays. It goes on to suggest how to scrutinize and reform the tax treatment of workers and how to extend that approach to business owners with far-reaching implications. Finally, the Article relates the undertaxation of business owners and the <b>overtaxation</b> of workers to the broader social policy discussions concerning the high rate of unemployment in the private sector and the escalating deficits in the public sector. It concludes that the success of the U. S. economy in the twenty-first century requires the tax law to treat both business owners and workers as producers. It further concludes that the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s continuing failure to acknowledge that business owners and workers are both consumers and producers undermines the goals of efficiency and fairness...|$|E
40|$|Today, many {{working parents}} {{are caught in}} a “childcare squeeze”: while they require two incomes just to make ends meet, they end up {{spending}} a strikingly large percentage of their income on childcare {{so that they can}} work outside the home. Worse still, some parents find themselves “squeezed out” of the market entirely, unable to earn the additional income their families require because they cannot find jobs that pay enough to offset soaring childcare expenses. This Article argues that the tax laws have {{played an important role in}} aggravating these hardships. Currently, the Internal Revenue Code treats the childcare costs incurred by working parents as personal expenses, subject to various dollar limitations, percentage limits, and phaseouts. Once these limitations are applied, working parents will receive tax relief for only a small fraction of the childcare costs they actually incur. This Article shows that this is inappropriate as a matter of fundamental tax policy and results in the <b>overtaxation</b> of the working family. It then provides a blueprint for meaningful reform that would properly treat working childcare costs like other costs of earning income and keep the tax laws from worsening the working family’s economic plight...|$|E
