The extant lists of his authorities cover more than 400, including 146 Roman and 327 Greek and <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information. The lists generally follow {{the order of the}} subject matter of each book. This has been shown in Heinrich Brunn's Disputatio (Bonn, 1856).|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1939, Mimi finally married Smith. They {{bought a}} semi-detached house called Mendips (named after {{the range of}} hills) at 251 Menlove Avenue (across {{the road from the}} Allerton Park golf course) in a middle-class area of Liverpool. After World War II started the British Government took over the Smith family's {{farmland}} for war work, and they had to find <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> income.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> non-Italian {{troops in}} the late Republic were subject provincials, allied cities and Rome's amici (satellite kings). During the late Republic, non-Italian units were led by their own native chiefs, and their {{internal}} organisation was {{left to their own}} commanders. The units varied widely in dress, equipment, and weapons. They were normally raised for specific campaigns and often disbanded soon afterwards, in a similar manner to the earlier socii militia legions.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E

5|$|Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, {{about native}} British saints survive {{from the period}} of the mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at this time is concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. <b>Other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was compiled in the late 9th century.|$|E
5|$|At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is {{the site}} of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is {{believed}} that members of the Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for the occupant of the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's early {{economy was}} based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. During the 1880s {{agricultural}} products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand. Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census, although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector. The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people. Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. <b>Other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E

5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system. The Poor Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948, with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.|$|E
5|$|The most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming, which {{relied on}} rain to water their crops, but others {{utilized}} runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe {{that prior to}} the 13th century, springs and <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited {{to members of the}} surrounding community.|$|E
5|$|With paying gigs {{harder to}} find and paying less, Sims turned to <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> income. Despite not having had any formal {{instruction}} himself, he taught dance, including to such later stars as Gregory Hines and Ben Vereen. He also taught footwork to boxing greats Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. Less glamorously, he ran a café, and even worked as a carpenter and a mechanic. Despite the lean times for hoofers, Sims was always able to {{put food on the}} table for his family, having married in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was {{suspicious}} of him, and {{worried that he}} was under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through {{the strength of its}} teachers' union. Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the Caribbean Legion. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included Fidel Castro, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister Jacobo Árbenz. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. <b>Other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{social impact}} of {{television}} in Croatia {{is considered to}} be imperfect and that of variable quality, television is important in the society because it offers a way for non-governmental organizations to communicate their concerns to the public and to criticize the government and other aspects of politics of Croatia. Television is the most widespread source of information in Croatiaon average 57% of the population of Croatia uses television as their primary source of information. That percentage varies significantly by geographic regionfrom 43% in Zagreb and areas surrounding the capital to 79% in Slavoniabut in every region it surpasses all <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information, the second most widely used source of information being the Internet averaging at 19%.
