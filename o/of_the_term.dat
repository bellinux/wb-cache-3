40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to empirical research on <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. We start by proposing {{a method for}} constructing different measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. This is achieved by estimating a range of substitution elasticities using a panel data approach and highly disaggregated data on trade flows. Next, various measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade and trade margins are related to productivity and demand proxies. We find that domestic demand side movements are positively related to <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade, while domestic productivity gains result in a deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. Our results suggest that higher relative productivity raises <b>the</b> real component <b>of</b> exports relative to imports along the intensive margin inducing a weakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade.

30|$|This study {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> and descriptions currently used in press and academic literature plus a clear delineation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms.</b> Hereby, <b>the</b> specific attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> are identified and consolidated. Subsequently, the consolidated attributes serve as measurement where <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> can be aligned to. In this vein, the linkages and relationships between <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> and their underlying concepts are uncovered. In the last step, a conceptual framework is introduced to classify <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> in several dimensions.|$|R

5|$|The first {{documented}} use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Primitivo {{appears in}} Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name {{derives from the}} terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties. This name's appearance, 40 {{years after the first}} documented use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} has a four-year term, commencing {{on the first}} Monday of the January after an election. The Constitution of Utah originally stated that, should the office of governor be vacant, the power be devolved upon the Secretary of State, but the office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1976, and a 1980 constitutional amendment added it to the constitution. If the office of governor becomes vacant {{during the first year}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> the lieutenant governor becomes governor until the next general election; if it becomes vacant after the first year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. The Governor of Utah was formerly limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws were repealed by the Utah Legislature in 2003; Utah {{is one of the few}} states where gubernatorial term limits are not determined by the constitution.|$|E

5|$|Theories {{have been}} {{proposed}} about the relation between Ragnarök and the 9th century Old High German epic poem Muspilli about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word Muspille appears, and the 9th century Old Saxon epic poem Heliand {{about the life of}} Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify {{the end of the world}} through fire. Old Norse forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> also appear throughout accounts of Ragnarök, where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about the meaning and origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> its etymology has not been solved.|$|E
5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school for the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism.

5|$|As in 1884, the {{election}} {{focused on the}} swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana.

5|$|Prior to 2010, {{unlike most}} other states, New Jersey {{did not have}} the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Until 2010, when the office of governor was vacant or the governor was unable to fulfill his/her duties through injury, the President of the State Senate served as the acting governor. The Senate President continued in the legislative role during his/her tenure as the state's acting chief executive, thus giving the person control over executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until the next general election, until the governor recovered from his/her injuries, or, if the governor died or resigned less than 16 months before end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> until the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> Richard Codey served as acting governor of New Jersey until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey in late 2004.
