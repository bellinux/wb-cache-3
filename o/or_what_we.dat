Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him.

On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

Brăileanu {{was at first}} a follower of Alexandru Averescu and his People's League, the Bukovina wing of which he led. He was {{involved in}} a lengthy dispute with a Nicolai Mitenco, after deposing him as editor of Țărănimea newspaper and [...] "purging" [...] the party of undesirables. In September 1924, with an article he published in Societatea de Mâine, Brăileanu sought to identify the political problems of Greater Romania as they affected Bukovina's society. It suggested that, in the new political climate, [...] "entirely stunted by the supremacy of timely politics, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call politicking", Romanian intellectuals were [...] "caving into a despotic domination by the bankers". He claimed that the Bukovina Jews were a parasitical class, 90% of whom [...] "made a living from the stupidity of the native population", and justified economic antisemitism as a reaction to historical [...] "imbalance". Nonetheless, he argued in favor of complete Jewish assimilation, including [...] "long processes of interbreeding" [...] with Romanians and a renewed social organization, based on the [...] "division of labor" [...] (with references to Conta and Émile Durkheim).|$|E

A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism."

Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism."

2500|$|The 2010 {{version of}} Freddy Krueger {{appeared}} as a downloadable playable character for Mortal Kombat. He has become the second non-Mortal Kombat character {{to appear in the}} game with the other being Kratos from the God of War series (who was an exclusive character for the PlayStation 3 version, while Freddy was available across all versions of the game). The game depicts Krueger as a malevolent spirit inhibiting the Dream Realm who attacks Shao Kahn for [...] "stealing" [...] the souls of his potential victims. During the fight, he is pulled into the game's fictional depiction of the real world. The injured Krueger arms himself with two razor claws to continue to battle Kahn. Upon defeating him, Krueger is sent back to the Dream Realm by Nightwolf, where he continues to haunt the dreams of his human prey. In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cited the character's violent nature and iconic status as reasoning for the inclusion in the game, [...] "Over the years, we’ve certainly had a number of conversations about guest characters. At one point, we had a conversation about having a group — imagine Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We never got a grip on how we would do it, whether they’d be DLC characters <b>or</b> <b>what.</b> <b>We</b> also wanted to introduce a character who was unexpected. This DLC thing opens the doors to realizing these ideas." [...] Krueger went on to become playable in the mobile edition of the game's sequel, Mortal Kombat X, alongside Jason from Friday the 13th. In October 2017, Krueger's 2010 version was released as a downloadable playable character in the seventh chapter of the asymmetric survival horror game Dead by Daylight, alongside Quentin Smith.|$|E
