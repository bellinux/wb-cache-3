5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>materials,</b> like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>materials,</b> while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the ‘massification’ of strategy. The primary sense of massification reflects {{the recovery of}} Latour's ‘missing masses’ in strategy research, in other words the growing recognition of material artefacts. But there are two contingent senses of massification as well. First, many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>material</b> artefacts are mass-produced (e. g. laptops) and therefore commonly used across many sites of strategy work. Second, some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>material</b> artefacts (e. g. social media) are increasingly tools for mass participation, facilitating the involvement of many employees in strategy work. This paper considers the implications of both mass production and mass participation for strategy-as-practice research, {{particularly with regard to}} comparative method and critical scrutiny...|$|R
