The Athsheans are shown as a gentle people, in contrast the violence and aggression of the Terrans.|$|E

25|$|According to Rupert Gethin, taṇhā {{is related}} to aversion and ignorance. Craving leads to aversion, anger, cruelty and violence, states Gethin, which are {{unpleasant}} states and cause suffering to one who craves. Craving is based on misjudgement, states Gethin, {{that the world is}} permanent, unchanging, stable, and reliable. Leifer relates taṇhā to avidya (moho), because {{it is based on the}} mistaken presumption that the samsaric dance <b>of</b> <b>opposites</b> is ultimate reality.|$|E
25|$|The Principle of Rhythm {{expresses the}} idea that in {{everything}} there is manifested a measured motion, a to and from, a flow and inflow, a swing backward and forward, a pendulum-like movement.

25|$|Arguments favoring {{discrimination}} against women are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western misogynist writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from Formicarius (1435), Preceptorium divinae legis (1475) and Lectiones super ecclesiastes (1380).Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its negative pole. Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation <b>of</b> <b>opposites,</b> but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. Because women are the negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|He wrote {{at length}} on {{the unity of}} judgment, on the {{different}} kinds of negation, and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity. In his doctrine of syllogisms he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here and there in the laying down and arranging the modi of the syllogisms, partly in the proof of them, partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion. Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them; and further, with hypothetical conclusions. For the doctrine of proof, Galen quotes the second Analytic of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine. In different monographs he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of science. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his Topics, that the principles <b>of</b> <b>opposites</b> are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus. For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the Topica of Theophrastus. Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas, which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle's Metaphysics.|$|E
500|$|Koppelman was {{an early}} student of Aesthetic Realism, the {{philosophy}} founded in 1941 by Eli Siegel, {{which is based on}} the principle, [...] "All beauty is a making one <b>of</b> <b>opposites,</b> and the making one <b>of</b> <b>opposites</b> is what we are going after in ourselves". This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, [...] "When Eli Siegel showed that what makes a work of art beautiful [...] the oneness <b>of</b> <b>opposites</b> [...] is the same as what every individual wants, {{it was one of the}} mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind".|$|E

Thus, it represents the tension between the masculine and the feminine.|$|E

The game's characters were particularly inspired by Level-5's previous work on the Professor Layton series (2007–present).

500|$|Ardhanarishvara symbolizes {{that the}} male and female {{principles}} are inseparable. The composite form conveys the unity <b>of</b> <b>opposites</b> (coniunctio oppositorum) in the universe. The male half of Ardhanarishvara stands for Purusha and female half is Prakriti. Purusha is the male principle and passive force of the universe, while Prakriti is the female active force; both are [...] "constantly drawn to embrace and fuse with each other, though... separated by the intervening axis". The union of Purusha (Shiva) and Prikriti (Shiva's energy, Shakti) generates the universe, an idea also manifested in the union of the Linga of Shiva and Yoni of Devi creating the cosmos. The Mahabharata lauds this form as the source of creation. Ardhanarishvara also suggests the element of Kama or Lust, which leads to creation.|$|E
