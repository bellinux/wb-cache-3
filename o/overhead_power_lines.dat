5|$|The Dalmatian pelican is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> and the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct. However, several colonies are increasing in size and the colony at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece has nearly 1000 breeding pairs.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E

50|$|A Wireless {{powerline}} sensor {{hangs from}} an <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>line</b> and sends measurements to a data collection system. Because the sensor does not contact {{anything but a}} single live conductor, no high-voltage isolation is needed. The sensor, installed simply by clamping it around a conductor, powers itself from energy scavenged from electrical or magnetic fields surrounding the conductor being measured. <b>Overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>line</b> monitoring helps distribution system operators provide reliable service at optimized cost.|$|R

25|$|Refurbishment {{of power}} {{generation}} and transmission systems at Black Eagle Dam began in 2010. In June of that year, PPL Montana initiated a $55 million effort to replace <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> connecting the dam to the area's electric grid. The new power lines (which replaced equipment more than 80 years old) were more widely spaced apart, to permit large birds to pass safely through or {{perch on the}} power lines. PPL also said it was replacing the electrical substation next to the dam's powerhouse. Both projects {{are expected to be}} complete in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Because Los Angeles {{is older}} than most other cities in California, the LADWP is {{currently}} faced with several unique issues. Most of the power lines in Los Angeles were built above-ground before it became customary to run power lines below-ground; as a result, the horizon line of the typical Los Angeles boulevard looks much more cluttered than boulevards in most Southern California cities. Starting in 2007, LADWP has a long-term project to upgrade the <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> and convert them to underground. This difficult conversion has been slowed by budget constraints, the impact on traffic, the pursuit of other modernization projects, and the lingering effects of a workforce reduction over the last decade. Budget issues are particularly acute in the department's transmission system, where underground transmission costs about 10 to 14 times the cost of overhead transmission, per unit length, and the technical and environmental challenges which confront such installations. Additionally, undergrounding of the three 500 kV transmission lines (five lines, if the Pacific AC Intertie's two 500 kV lines terminating in Los Angeles are included) is presently technically infeasible. Upgrading the overhead lines {{is expected to take}} 10 to 15 years. The upgrading of LADWP's <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> consists of eliminating the V-shape brackets on the power poles that are holding up the crossarm and replacing them with cross-brackets that are put on the crossarm. Some of the wooden power poles are being replaced with metal poles.|$|E

25|$|Blue Line bus {{rapid transit}} service on the State Route 99 {{corridor}} was preceded by decades of transit services traveling through southwestern Snohomish County, which ranged from an interurban railway to local buses. The Seattle–Everett Interurban Railway ran interurban service from 1910 to 1939 along the Pacific Highway, later U.S. Route 99 and State Route 99. During its heyday, the interurban ran at 30-minute headways throughout the day, and only made automatic stops at its terminals in Everett and Seattle. The railway was dismantled and later used as right of way for <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> until it was converted into a rail trail in the 1990s and 2000s, named the Interurban Trail.|$|E
25|$|When new, {{the units}} were {{initially}} numbered {{in the range}} 001-091, but were later renumbered to 303 001-091 when TOPS was introduced. Each unit consisted of 3-cars coupled together in a semi-permanent formation, and up to four sets could be operated in multiple to form up to a 12-car formation. Although 6-car formations were frequently operated, 9-car formations were operated occasionally. 12-car formations were usually only seen {{as a result of}} train failures or ECS workings to the depots at Shields Road or Hyndland. The two outer carriages of each unit were driving trailers, with an intermediate motor coach containing the motor bogies and electrical equipment. Units operated from the standard 25 kV alternating current (AC) <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> system, with power collection via a Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph on the motor coach. The technical description of the formation is DTSO+MBSO+BDTSO. Individual vehicle numbers are shown below.|$|E

[...] Initially, residents were promised that <b>overhead</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> would be buried {{as part of the}} project, but as cost overruns mounted, this plan was scrapped. [...] Neighborhood opponents of the tram have cited other reasons for opposing the tram's construction, including the fact that the North Corbett neighborhood is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] Some residents filed a lawsuit against the city and OHSU, claiming that they own the [...] "airspace" [...] above their properties. [...] The city later offered to purchase homes directly under the tram route at fair market value.|$|E
