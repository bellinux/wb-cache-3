5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Medieval folk traditions enumerate the pestilences and misfortunes which befell Lalli {{after his}} slaying of the bishop. His hair and scalp {{are said to}} have fallen <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> took off the bishop's cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop's ring from his finger, just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{played out}} a {{draw in the}} third match at Manchester, where Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from the bowling of Ray Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. He also dropped Compton three times, allowing the English batsman to go from 50 to 145 not <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> held the hosts' first innings together.|$|E

5|$|Alan and Alice {{arrive at}} a cabin on {{an island in the}} middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> submerges.|$|E
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was more broadminded in contrast to individuals they had worked with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Lovitt was {{succeeded by}} Dr. Perry Nussbaum. Born in Toronto in 1908 and raised there, Nussbaum had {{attended}} a small Orthodox synagogue as a boy, and, after high school, worked as {{secretary for the}} Holy Blossom Temple's rabbi Barnett R. Brickner. With encouragement from Brickner, in 1926 he applied and was accepted into a combined eight-year rabbinic ordination and degree program at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and University of Cincinnati. He graduated in 1933, Hebrew Union College's first Canadian graduate. He was the last member of his class to receive an offer of a position, {{so he had to}} accept as his first rabbinic posting a role at a Reform synagogue in Melbourne. This did not work <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was too inexperienced. Nussbaum subsequently served at a synagogue in Amarillo, Texas, and in 1937 accepted a position as a prison chaplain in Pueblo, Colorado, where he also worked as a part-time librarian at the local university, and taught public speaking. In 1941 he became rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in Wichita, Kansas, and in 1943 he joined the Chaplain Corps of the United States Army. He served in the Philippines, and eventually became a colonel in the United States Army Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|Stacey {{explains}} to Dot that Bradley {{knew he was}} not Lily's father. Dot informs Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), who tells her he already knows. Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, he wonders if she has ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder. He tells her {{that she needs to}} keep the truth about Lily's father {{and the fact that she}} killed Peggy's husband Archie (Larry Lamb) several months previously to herself. Phil tries to convince various people to let him <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is suffering withdrawal symptoms, but nobody will. Janine awakens in Richard's flat and gets dressed, though they did not have sex. She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Janine fears that she is not good enough for Ryan, but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria, leaving Lily in a bedroom upstairs. She is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, and is frightened to hear Phil making noises in the living room. Stacey tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she killed Archie.|$|E
25|$|In episode 10, Kelly {{comes back}} to Beverly Hills and reveals that a romantic reunion with Dylan did not work <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has the same {{commitment}} issues that plagued their relationship before. She also comments on how he looks {{exactly the same as}} he did in high school.|$|E

Kevin comforts him and they embrace.|$|E
25|$|Batting averages can be {{strongly}} {{affected by the}} number of not outs. For example, Phil Tufnell, who was noted for his poor batting, has an apparently respectable ODI average of 15 (from 20 games), despite a highest score of only 5 not <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> scored an overall total of 15 runs from 10 innings, but was out only once.|$|E
25|$|In Monaco, he {{qualified}} {{ninth and}} {{moved up to}} sixth position through the first corner. Later, he had a suspension failure caused by a loose drain cover and crashed heavily. After crashing he threw the car's steering wheel <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{was sitting in the}} middle of a 120mph corner with his car on fire. This was then run over by Karun Chandhok's Hispania.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{had been}} denied the {{decisions}} that in his judgment favored a military solution, MacArthur nevertheless wanted no further restrictions placed on the operations of his command. In so advising the Joint Chiefs on March 21, he pointed <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had some time earlier, that under current conditions any appreciable UN effort to clear North Korea already {{was out of the}} question.|$|E
25|$|Ultima's Owl – Embodies Ultima's soul, {{the power}} of her mysticism, and her life force. The song the owl sings softly outside Antonio’s window at night {{indicates}} Ultima’s presence and magical protection in Antonio’s life. Ultima's owl scratches Tenorio's eye <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stands in Gabriel's doorway and demands {{the right to take}} Ultima away from Gabriel's house. By {{the end of the novel}} Tenorio has figured out the connection between Ultima and her owl. By killing Ultima's owl, Tenorio destroys Ultima’s soul and life force, which leads quickly to her death. Antonio takes on the responsibility of burying the owl and realizes that he is really burying Ultima.|$|E
25|$|The player {{enters the}} central chamber, {{resisting}} the Dark Fall, and recites the incantation, imprisoning it, and releasing the trapped souls. Timothy thanks him, {{and before he}} departs, tells him things may not have turned <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> thinks. All evidence of the spirits trapped by the Dark Fall throughout history disappear. The game then cuts back to the opening scene, as the player receives a message from Pete. In the message, Pete begins by saying he has something very important to tell his brother, but then forgets why he rang, and says the redevelopment of the hotel is going well, {{and he will be}} home shortly.|$|E

25|$|In One Day Internationals, Rameez Raja (for Pakistan against England at Karachi in 1987) {{was given}} out for {{hitting the ball}} away with his bat to avoid being run out going for his century off the last ball of the innings, and Mohinder Amarnath (for India against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad in 1989) was given out for kicking the ball away to avoid being run out. Another batsman to be given out this way is Inzamam-ul-Haq of Pakistan in the first ODI of India vs Pakistan Hutch Cup on 6 February 2006. After Inzamam drove the ball to mid off, Indian Suresh Raina threw {{it back to the}} striker's end, Inzamam {{stopping}} it with his bat. Umpire Simon Taufel gave him <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was in the line of the stumps and out of his crease (and thus would have been run out had the ball hit the stumps).|$|E
25|$|India lost {{yet another}} ODI final, their fifth {{successive}} loss and their eighth without a victory, {{as they went}} down to New Zealand in Harare. And yet again, they threw away a very promising start. Batting first after Sourav Ganguly won the toss, the returning Shane Bond and Kyle Mills kept them down {{for the first two}} overs, bowling an accurate line as the score moved to five for no loss. Sehwag and Ganguly eventually found their feet, though, and after thirteen overs they had added 72 runs, despite being beaten time and again. Jacob Oram conceded fifteen runs off his first eleven deliveries, but Ganguly holed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was caught by Hamish Marshall. At 72 for 1, India were well in control, and Mohammad Kaif started to accumulate with Sehwag. Boundaries came with regularity, as India moved past 100 and then past 150 without losing a wicket. At 153 for 1 after 24 overs, they were genuinely looking at a chance to get 300.|$|E
25|$|After his {{hospitalization}} Barkhorn {{was invited}} by Adolf Galland {{to join the}} elite Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet-fighter. He found flying the Me 262 over the western front difficult {{and he did not}} score any victories in it. On 21 April 1945, he flew his 1,104th and last mission. One of the engines of his aircraft flamed <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was approaching an enemy bomber formation and he was forced to make an emergency landing. As he approached the airfield, his jet was attacked by several prowling North American P-51 Mustang fighters. Barkhorn managed to land his burning plane though he received a slight wound {{as a result of this}} action when the cockpit canopy — which on the Me 262A, flipped open to starboard, like a Bf 109's did — prior to crash landing, slammed shut on his neck. Taken prisoner by the Western Allies while still in hospital, he was released from Allied captivity in September 1945.|$|E
