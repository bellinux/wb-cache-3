40|$|COMMA 15 was one {{of three}} solo {{exhibitions}} under the rubric ‘Painting as Minor Form’, which asked how marginal modes of painting can operate as critique of more established formalist painting canons. Kiaer’s research generated a provisional and fragmentary position for painting within contemporary art practice. The three exhibitions proposed three different qualities of the minor form. At (COMMA 15) Bloomberg SPACE, London (2010), Kiaer looked into the underlying narrative of Alexandre Dumas’s Black Tulip for its motif of the <b>offset</b> <b>bulb</b> as a mode of refinement towards black. For the Kunstverein München (2010) Kiaer re-evaluated the original premise of the Kunstverein – whose concern was the mercantile presentation of minor still-lives, portraiture and genre paintings – {{as an alternative to the}} institution of the academy, which was primarily interested in the grand gestures of history painting. The exhibition at Fondazione Querini Stampalia, Venice (2011) provided an opportunity to look at the work of 18 th-century painter Pietro Longhi in conjunction with the architect Carlo Scarpa, both of whose practices could be understood in minor terms of refinement, taste, and manners as an alternative means of critique to formalism. In a review for Art Forum (2010), Gilda Williams identified this inquiry into painting as a minor form as offering an alternative route in painting to what has become an over-generalised understanding of ‘painting in the expanded field’. Works from these exhibitions are now in public collections, including Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich and FRAC Île-de-France, Paris. Interviews, articles and reviews of this project have been published in Art Forum, Art Monthly, Guardian online, Art World and Tate etc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} activities {{developed by}} the authors within the EC funded research program named FACE (Friendly Aircraft Cabin Environment) aimed at characterising some aeronautical composite structural components from the vibro-acoustic behaviour point of view. In this document will be also presented the overall analysis of a carbon resin primary fuselage structure from low to medium-high frequency range. Vibro-acoustic behaviour is simulated by means of numerical predictive methods. The modelling techniques are shown {{with reference to the}} simulation of dynamic behaviour of panels coupled with a fluid volume, in order to predict Transmission Loss properties. Particularly, the models and results have been referred to a typical aeronautical structure for fuselage: 4 bay fuselage side panel, made of skin, stringers and frames. The first test article consists in a composite panel that has been modeled numerically and tested in order to characterize its vibro-acoustic behaviour. It is a curved panel, global dimensions of 2. 2 m x 1. 5 m, where the skin is a pre-preg composite laminate, frames are Z-section pre-preg composite laminate and stringers are T-section braided tube with a pre-preg <b>offset</b> <b>bulb.</b> Numerical simulations have been carried on, in order to reproduce the vibrations and noise transmission: in low frequency range by means of Finite Element Method (FEM), and in medium-high frequency range by means of Statistical Energetic Analysis (SEA). For what concerning the FEM dynamic analysis the mesh size values of the elements are consistent with the maximum frequency chosen. According to the procedures described in the work, a FEM model has been built, having 9266 nodes and 14069 elements; the skin has been modeled with shell elements; the frames have been modeled with beam elements and stringers have been split, modeling the stringer foot with shell elements, web and bulb with beam elements. The MSC/NASTRAN has been used throughout the F. E. calculations of this article. The numerical modal analysis has been performed in [0 - 2000] Hz frequency range, considering panel as free-free suspended. For what concerning the SEA, the modelling approach employed has been a mixed “ribbed plate“ – “subsystem” approach. Source and receiving rooms have been modelled as acoustic cavities subsystems with one of the enclosing faces of each room corresponding with the panel area and geometry. Correlation between numerical and experimental modal analysis results has been used in order to validate numerical FEM models, while energetic parameters (mean square velocity) and modal density have been used for SEA models validation. Subsequently, model sensitivity has been analysed by varying some geometrical parameters critical from an acoustic point of view. Results confirm the theory at the basis of noise transmission and give some important information about the composite materials behavior used in primary structures in place of well known metallic materials. Final result of the work is the model of a fuselage section assembled by mixing many Graphite Fibres Reinforced Panels layups...|$|E
2500|$|Propagation is by <b>offset</b> <b>bulbs,</b> {{either by}} careful {{division}} of clumps in full growth ("in the green"), or removed when {{the plants are}} dormant, immediately after the leaves have withered; or by seeds sown either when ripe, or in spring. Professional growers and keen amateurs also use such methods as [...] "twin-scaling" [...] to increase the stock of choice cultivars quickly.|$|R
5|$|<b>Bulb</b> <b>offsets</b> {{and tissue}} culture produce genetic clones {{of the parent}} plant and thus {{maintaining}} genetic integrity of the cultivars. <b>Bulb</b> <b>offsets</b> usually require {{at least a year}} before flowering. Commercially, plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell.|$|R
5000|$|Notholirion {{is a small}} Asian genus of bulbous {{plants in}} the lily family. It {{is closely related to}} Lilium, but each {{individual}} flowers only once, and then dies after producing <b>offsets.</b> The <b>bulb</b> is covered by a tunic. Leaves are basal, produced in autumn and winter.|$|R
50|$|The bulbs {{are best}} planted {{just below the}} surface of the soil, with the neck of the bulb level with the surface. In colder climates {{mulching}} or lifting and overwintering is required. The bulbs may be propagated from <b>offsets.</b> Amaryllis <b>bulbs</b> require little watering and are drought tolerant.|$|R
6000|$|Such flowers as the CARNATION, COMMON TULIP, and HYACINTH, {{which are}} {{believed}} to be descended, each from a single wild form, present innumerable varieties, differing almost exclusively in the size, form, and colour of the flowers. These and some other anciently cultivated plants which have been long propagated by <b>offsets,</b> pipings, <b>bulbs,</b> etc., become so excessively variable, that almost each new plant raised from seed forms a new variety, [...] "all of which to describe particularly," [...] as old Gerarde wrote in 1597, [...] "were to roll Sisyphus's stone, or to number the sands." ...|$|R
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using <b>bulb</b> <b>offsets</b> and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and may need to be controlled as weeds.|$|R
6000|$|The plants {{which have}} varied by buds belong {{to so many}} orders that we may infer that almost every plant would be liable to variation, if placed under the proper {{exciting}} conditions. These conditions, {{as far as we}} can judge, mainly depend on long-continued and high cultivation; for almost all the plants in the foregoing list are perennials, and have been largely propagated in many soils, under different climates, by cuttings, <b>offsets,</b> <b>bulbs,</b> tubers, and especially by budding or grafting. The instances of annuals varying by buds, or producing on the same plant differently coloured flowers, are comparatively rare: Hopkirk (11/156. 'Flora Anomala' page 164.) has seen this with Convolvulus tricolor; and it is not uncommon with the Balsam and annual Delphinium. According to Sir R. Schomburgk, plants from the warmer temperate regions, when cultivated under the hot climate of St. Domingo, are eminently liable to bud-variation. I am informed by Mr. Sedgwick that moss-roses which have often been taken to Calcutta always there lose their mossiness; but change of climate is by no means a necessary contingent, as we see with the gooseberry, currant, and in many other cases. Plants living under their natural conditions are very rarely subject to bud-variation. Variegated leaves have, however, been observed under such circumstances; and I have given an instance of variation by buds on an ash-tree planted in ornamental grounds, but it is doubtful whether such a tree can be considered as living under strictly natural conditions. Gartner has seen white and dark-red flowers produced from the same root of the wild Achillea millefolium; and Prof. Caspary has seen a completely wild Viola lutea bearing flowers of two different colours and sizes.

50|$|Tulips can be {{propagated}} through <b>bulb</b> <b>offsets,</b> seeds or micropropagation. Offsets {{and tissue}} culture methods are means of asexual propagation for producing genetic clones {{of the parent}} plant, which maintains cultivar genetic integrity. Seeds are most often used to propagate species and subspecies or to create new hybrids. Many tulip species can cross-pollinate with each other, and when wild tulip populations overlap geographically with other tulip species or subspecies, they often hybridise and create mixed populations. Most commercial tulip cultivars are complex hybrids, and often sterile.|$|R
25|$|Snowdrops are hardy {{herbaceous}} {{plants that}} perennate by underground bulbs. They {{are among the}} earliest spring bulbs to bloom, although a few forms of G. nivalis are autumn flowering. In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile, found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites. The leaves die back {{a few weeks after}} the flowers have faded. Galanthus plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming <b>bulb</b> <b>offsets.</b> They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.|$|R
60|$|Hence we {{are led to}} look at {{inheritance}} as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly. But {{this power}} often appears to us in our ignorance to act capriciously, transmitting a character with inexplicable strength or feebleness. The very same peculiarity, as the weeping habit of trees, silky feathers, etc., may be inherited either firmly {{or not at all}} by different members of the same group, and even by different individuals of the same species, though treated in the same manner. In this latter case we see that the power of transmission is a quality which is merely individual in its attachment. As with single characters, so it is with the several concurrent slight differences which distinguish sub-varieties or races; for of these, some can be propagated almost as truly as species, whilst others cannot be relied on. The same rule holds good with plants, when propagated by <b>bulbs,</b> <b>offsets,</b> etc., which in one sense still form parts of the same individual, for some varieties retain or inherit through successive bud-generations their character far more truly than others.|$|R
