5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> he had experienced in his career, {{based on the fact that}} the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E
5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> {{that the}} {{developers}} faced was in adding enough elements to Metroid: Zero Mission {{to make it}} feel new, while keeping {{the spirit of the}} original Metroid. Because both games were made for the Game Boy Advance, Metroid: Zero Mission uses a rebuilt version of the game engine used for Metroid Fusion so that it {{did not need to be}} built from scratch. This marked the first time two Metroid installments have been released for the same video game console. Metroid Fusion had offered connectivity with Metroid Prime on the Nintendo GameCube, but Metroid: Zero Mission did not offer such a feature. Sakamoto explained that the developers wanted to make the game connect to Metroid Prime 2: Echoes on the GameCube, but the fact that both their release dates were far apart and not enough development time to implement connectivity features prevented them from doing so. However, they managed to include the ability for Metroid Fusion to connect with Metroid: Zero Mission.|$|E

25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> is trying to keep it in one piece.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Bern {{has had to}} deal with {{incorporating}} the modern world into a medieval city. The plaza where the Christoffelturm used to be, has become the central bus stop for the city. The main train station was built under the plaza, and actually includes some of the foundations from the Christoffelturm and wall in the train station. However, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> has been integrating automobile traffic into the Old City. Due to the number of important buildings in the Old City and the central location of the Old City, it was impossible to completely close off this area to vehicles. While some streets have remained pedestrian zones, most major streets carry city buses, trams or personal vehicles.|$|E
25|$|New to Soulblighter {{were moving}} 3D models within the gaming world, {{something}} none of Bungie staff had ever created before. For example, the opening level features a fully functional windmill, and a later level features a drawbridge that closes as the level begins, {{and which the}} player must then lower so their army can gain access to a castle. Although the original game featured {{the same kind of}} 3D polygonal models, none of them moved, and implementing this feature proved to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> the team encountered in making the game. Another challenge also involved something not seen in the first game; a level set indoors. For this level, which is set in a large castle, the AI had to be rewritten as two enemy units could be right beside one another but {{not be able to see}} each other because of a wall between them. Previously, two units standing beside one another would automatically attack. Writing this new code into the AI scripting language proved especially difficult for the programmers.|$|E

25|$|Jeff Kleiser and Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co.'s {{visual effects}} team of 40 people created {{the look of}} the Stargate. They used self-written image-creation and {{compositing}} software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards, and the cityscape of Nagada. Footprints in the sand were often digitally removed. The creation of the wormhole, which was fully digital, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> in the making of the film. The ripples had to be digitally composited to appear accurate and realistic. Scanning lasers were lined up parallel to the gate to illustrate the amount of body that passed the surface of the Stargate plane. Afterwards, the parts of the body that had or had not yet gone through the gate (depending of the side of filming) were obliterated with a digital matte - a process that removes unwanted components from an individual frame or sequence of frames. The use of computers generating a big 3D storyboard allowed Emmerich to try out different shooting angles before settling on one angle.|$|E
500|$|In a 2001 interview, gameworld {{designer}} Morten Byom {{said that}} the process of creating Rubi-Ka's virtual world had [...] "taken more time and effort than anyone imagined when we first started." [...] The team took inspiration from a number of sources including science-fiction books, movies, architecture in Oslo, and other games in the genre. They stated <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> as finding ways to encourage players to use the entire game world as they play, not to [...] "gather in one corner". Byom said he wanted to give the world as much detail as possible to make the game [...] "convincing" [...] to the player.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} mid-October 2005 and continued through November over a total period of 25 days. The film {{was shot in}} sequence, with production starting in Eugene, Oregon and then moving to Reno, Nevada and subsequently Ensenada, Mexico. Hynes called the filming [...] "a high-wire act the whole way", and said that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> was transporting the crew of 40 from Oregon to Mexico, sometimes changing locations twice a day with few hours of daylight. A crew member lost the project's Filming Permit {{on the last day}} of shooting in Mexico, and filming at rush hour was halted by the police. Hynes took a smaller camera to film several blocks away from the original set, but the second assistant director soon arrived warning that the police were coming and that they would be taken to prison because they did not have the paperwork for filming. Hynes and the crew [...] "scatter", leaving Pucci alone further down the street, which Hynes claims is his strangest experience in the film industry. The crew later returned to Los Angeles to shoot final scenes and to commence post-production.|$|E

500|$|When {{creating}} {{the character of}} Adam Jensen, DeMarle wanted {{to give him a}} well-defined personality, and this necessitated balancing it with the narrative's player-driven nature. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> was {{creating the}} various dialogue choices, as she needed to imagine what a character would say if they were hostile when she might normally portray them as benign. Multiple layers of dialogue were created within these variances to create different atmospheres within the narrative. There was standard dialogue with minor characters, more complex dialogue with major characters in quests, and what DeMarle termed [...] "conversation boss fights", dialogue tied to the gameplay where social skill could help the player reach an objective. When creating characters, the team drew inspiration from the character portrayals in the Metal Gear series. When designing the corporate side, DeMarle particularly cited the backgrounds of Howard Hughes, Richard Branson and Bill Gates as inspiration for the powerful CEO figures in the narrative of Human Revolution. She also noted the way in which corporations had gained greater power than governments in the narrative, something that paralleled political comments on corporate power at the time.|$|E
500|$|Development on Path of Radiance {{began at}} Intelligent Systems after the {{international}} {{success of the}} first localized game in the series, released overseas under the title Fire Emblem. Due to high development costs, the team had been unwilling to develop a title for the GameCube, but after Fire Emblems success overseas, they decided to return from portable to home consoles for its next release. Nintendo SPD was also involved in development. Path of Radiance was the first Fire Emblem to have 3D in-game graphics, full-motion video cutscenes and voice acting. It {{was also the first}} home console game since [...] for the Super Famicom. Transitioning from 2D graphics to 3D graphics was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> during development, especially the transition from the tilted overhead view to a character-to-character battle in third-person. One of the features left out due to this process was a dedicated battle arena. At the same time, they introduced the base as members of the development team wanted a place where characters could interact separate from the battlefield. As there was no combat gameplay involved, other types of activity were created, such as special support conversations. To make moves in battle and cutscenes realistic, the team used motion capture, then made sure it appeared a little over the top so the fantasy feeling of the Fire Emblem series remained intact. By the end of development, Narihiro had some regrets {{about the quality of the}} game, saying in an interview that he considered it to be only 70% complete when released.|$|E
2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> to siRNA and RNAi based {{therapeutics}} is intracellular delivery. Delivery of siRNA via nanoparticles {{has shown}} promise. siRNA oligos in vivo {{are vulnerable to}} degradation by plasma and tissue nucleases and have shown only mild effectiveness in localized delivery sites, such as the human eye. Delivering pure DNA to target organisms is challenging because its large size and structure prevents it from diffusing readily across membranes. siRNA oligos circumvent this problem due to their small size of 21-23 oligos. This allows [...] delivery via nano-scale delivery vehicles called nanovectors.|$|E

Furthermore, the cronyism and corruption plaguing China's civil service, military, educational, judicial and medical systems sought to destroy the country bit by bit.

2500|$|Using {{the money}} in the right way in order to enforce actual change on the ground is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>challenges</b> ahead. Many {{academics}} argue that, in order to do this in an efficient way, all stakeholders should be involved in the process, instead of using a top-down approach. They point to that fact that, without their input, it is harder to achieve targets set. Moreover, projects often even miss out on their actual purpose. A group of researchers associated with the Australian National University, call for the foundation of so-called [...] "National Implementing Entities" [...] (NIE) in each country, that would become responsible for [...] "the implementation of sub-national projects". This would avoid national governments getting too involved, because in the past, they [...] "often hindered the flow of international support to subnational scale reform for sustainable development".|$|E
