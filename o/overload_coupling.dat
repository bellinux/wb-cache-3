However, increasing amounts of information can make finding appropriate information problematic. This information <b>overload,</b> <b>coupled</b> with decision complexity, can increase time required {{to make a decision}} and reduce decision quality. This creates a need for tools that support these decision-making processes. Online tools that bring together data and partial solutions are one option to improve decision making in complex, multi-criteria environments. An experiment using a prototype mashup application indicates that these types of applications may significantly decrease time spent and improve overall quality of complex retail decisions...|$|R

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of three new therapeutics from one of symptom amelioration with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to one of active treatment. Most patients develop transfusion-dependent anemia over the course of their disease, however, and its adverse consequence on the natural history of disease has only recently been appreciated. Although severe anemia contributes to symptoms of fatigue and reduced quality of life, transfusion dependence increases the risk of organ complications from iron <b>overload</b> <b>coupled</b> with an increased risk of leukemia transformation.

40|$|The {{visual system}} {{receives}} {{a wealth of}} sensory information of which only little is relevant for behavior. We present a mechanism in which alpha oscillations serve to prioritize different components of visual information. By way of simulated neuronal networks we show that inhibitory modulation in the alpha range (~ 10 Hz) can serve to temporally segment the visual information to prevent information <b>overload.</b> <b>Coupled</b> excitatory and inhibitory neurons generate a gamma rhythm in which information is segmented and sorted according to excitability in each alpha cycle. Further details are coded by distributed neuronal firing patterns within each gamma cycle. The network model produces coupling between alpha phase and gamma (40 - 100 Hz) amplitude in the simulated local field potential similar to that observed experimentally in human and animal recordings.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to create a}} {{suitable}} standard for evaluating lazy evaluation techniques, and to use this standard to compare existing methods of lazy evaluation in C++. For our standard we will create a rigorous definition of what lazy evaluation should entail, and a set of varied benchmarks to test the efficiency of these distinct approaches. The methods we will analyze will include techniques using template meta programming, operator <b>overloading</b> <b>coupled</b> with unique object creation, and C++ 11 lambda expressions. We will also take into account existing libraries such as Boost and FC++. Our thesis should be able to act as a resource to correctly select the optimal method for lazy evaluation in C++ given a specific problem. This paper will also make some comments on the evolution of lazy evaluation approaches in C++, and thus provide an appropriate segueway to it's sister paper, which tackles the best ways of implementing laziness in a language, and how C++ compares to other languages in this respect...|$|R
40|$|Iron <b>overload</b> <b>coupled</b> {{with low}} {{hepcidin}} levels are characteristics of hereditary haemochromatosis. To {{understand the role}} of transferrin receptor (TFR) and intracellular iron in hepcidin secretion, Chinese hamster ovary transferrin receptor variant (CHO TRVb- 1) cells were used that express iron-response-element-depleted human TFRC mRNA (TFRC∆IRE). Results showed that CHO TRVb- 1 cells expressed higher basal levels of cell-surface TFR 1 than HepG 2 cells (2. 2 -fold; p < 0. 01) and following 5 g/L holotransferrin treatment maintained constitutive over-expression at 24 h and 48 h, contrasting the HepG 2 cells where the receptor levels significantly declined. Despite this, the intracellular iron content was neither higher than HepG 2 cells nor increased over time under basal or holotransferrin-treated conditions. Interestingly, hepcidin secretion in CHO TRVb- 1 cells exceeded basal levels at all time-points (p < 0. 02) and matched levels in HepG 2 cells following treatment. While TFRC mRNA expression showed expected elevation (2 h, p < 0. 03; 4 h; p < 0. 05), slc 40 a 1 mRNA expression was also elevated (2 h, p < 0. 05; 4 h, p < 0. 03), unlike the HepG 2 cells. In conclusion, the CHO TRVb- 1 cells prevented cellular iron-overload by elevating slc 40 a 1 expression, thereby highlighting its significance {{in the absence of}} iron-regulated TFRC mRNA. Furthermore, hepcidin response to holotransferrin treatment was similar to HepG 2 cells and resembled the human physiological response...|$|R
40|$|The {{coach and}} {{interdisciplinary}} sports science and medicine team strive to continually progress the athlete's performance year on year. In structuring training programmes, coaches and scientists plan distinct periods of progressive <b>overload</b> <b>coupled</b> with recovery for anticipated performances {{to be delivered}} on fixed dates of competition in the calendar year. Peaking at major championships is a challenge, and training capacity highly individualised, with fine margins between the training dose necessary for adaptation and that which elicits maladaptation at the elite level. As such, optimising adaptation is key to effective preparation. Notably, however, many factors (eg, health, nutrition, sleep, training experience, psychosocial factors) play an essential part in moderating the processes of adaptation to exercise and environmental stressors, for example, heat, altitude; processes which can often fail or be limited. In the UK, the term unexplained underperformance syndrome (UUPS) has been adopted, {{in contrast to the}} more commonly referenced term overtraining syndrome, to describe a significant episode of underperformance with persistent fatigue, that is, maladaptation. This construct, UUPS, reflects the complexity of the syndrome, the multifactorial aetiology, and that ‘overtraining’ or an imbalance between training load and recovery may not be the primary cause for underperformance. UUPS draws on the distinction that a decline in performance represents the universal feature. In our review, we provide a practitioner-focused perspective, proposing that causative factors can be identified and UUPS explained, through an interdisciplinary approach (ie, medicine, nutrition, physiology, psychology) to sports science and medicine delivery, monitoring, and data interpretation and analysis...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of sea-level rise projections, {{there is a strong}} need for hindcast validation of the evolution of polar ice sheets in a way that tightly matches observational records (from radar, gravity, and altimetry observations mainly). However, the computational requirements for making hindcast reconstructions possible are severe and rely mainly on the evaluation of the adjoint state of transient ice-flow models. Here, we look at the computation of adjoints {{in the context of the}} NASA/JPL/UCI Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), written in C++ and designed for parallel execution with MPI. We present the adaptations required in the way the software is designed and written, but also generic adaptations in the tools facilitating the adjoint computations. We concentrate on the use of operator <b>overloading</b> <b>coupled</b> with the AdjoinableMPI library to achieve the adjoint computation of the ISSM. We present a comprehensive approach to (1)  carry out type changing through the ISSM, hence facilitating operator overloading, (2)  bind to external solvers such as MUMPS and GSL-LU, and (3)  handle MPI-based parallelism to scale the capability. We demonstrate the success of the approach by computing sensitivities of hindcast metrics such as the misfit to observed records of surface altimetry on the northeastern Greenland Ice Stream, or the misfit to observed records of surface velocities on Upernavik Glacier, central West Greenland. We also provide metrics for the scalability of the approach, and the expected performance. This approach has the potential to enable a new generation of hindcast-validated projections that make full use of the wealth of datasets currently being collected, or already collected, in Greenland and Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular Ca 2 + <b>overloading,</b> <b>coupled</b> to {{induction}} of oxidative stress, {{is present}} at 4 -wk aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDOST). This prooxidant reaction in cardiac myocytes and mitochondria accounts for necrotic cell death and subsequent myocardial scarring. It is intrinsically linked to increased intracellular zinc concentration ([Zn 2 +]i) {{serving as an}} antioxidant. Herein, we addressed the temporal responses in coupled Ca 2 + and Zn 2 + dyshomeostasis, reflecting the prooxidant-antioxidant equilibrium, by examining preclinical (week 1) and pathological (week 4) stages of ALDOST to determine whether endogenous antioxidant defenses would be ultimately overwhelmed to account for this delay in cardiac remodeling. We compared responses in cardiomyocyte free [Ca 2 +]i and [Zn 2 +]i and mitochondrial total [Ca 2 +]m and [Zn 2 +]m, together with biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses, during 1 - and 4 -wk ALDOST. At week 1 and compared with controls, we found: 1) elevations in [Ca 2 +]i and [Ca 2 +]m were coupled with [Zn 2 +]i and [Zn 2 +]m; 2) increased mitochondrial H 2 O 2 production, cardiomyocyte xanthine oxidase activity, and cardiac and mitochondrial 8 -isoprostane levels, counterbalanced by increased activity of antioxidant proteins, enzymes, and the nonenzymatic antioxidants that {{can be considered as}} cumulative antioxidant capacity; some of these enzymes and proteins (e. g., metallothionein- 1, Cu/Zn-superoxide, glutathione synthase) are regulated by metal-responsive transcription factor- 1; and 3) although these augmented antioxidant defenses were sustained at week 4, they fell short in combating the persistent intracellular Ca 2 + overloading and marked rise in cardiac tissue 8 -isoprostane and mitochondrial transition pore opening. Thus a coupled Ca 2 + and Zn 2 + dyshomeostasis occurs early during ALDOST in cardiac myocytes and mitochondria that regulate redox equilibrium until week 4 when ongoing intracellular Ca 2 + overloading and prooxidants overwhelm antioxidant defenses...|$|R

40|$|Background Scientific {{debate has}} {{considered}} whether ‘control over destiny’ {{could be a}} fundamental social determinant of health (and a lack thereof, an underlying cause of health inequalities). We identified plausible theoretical pathways from control in the living environment to health inequalities at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, and conducted a systematic review of the empirical evidence for these hypothesised pathways. Results for the micro-level are presented here. Methods Studies were identified by searching seven bibliographic databases, screening reference lists, consulting key informants and searching organisational websites. Observational studies of any design were included. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were carried out by two reviewers, with disagreements brought to the wider team. Analysis incorporated narrative synthesis. Results We identified 5 high quality prospective cohort studies in the UK and The Netherlands, and a further 19 studies of weaker design. Observational evidence from cohort studies suggests that low control at home may explain part of the association between household social position and coronary heart disease among women (but not men), possibly {{due to lack of}} material and psychosocial resources to cope with excessive household and family demands. This supports the theory that demand <b>overload,</b> <b>coupled</b> with lower control and fewer resources, is more prevalent with lower social position, and these factors interact leading to chronic stress and poorer health. Evidence also suggests that lower social positions are associated with both a) lower control beliefs; and b) poorer health outcomes; and that a substantial proportion of the association between low social position and health outcomes (heart disease, mortality) may be explained statistically by low control beliefs. The studies were not able to distinguish between the effects of having low control beliefs and actual experience of low control over essential resources, which have different implications for policy. Conclusions Observational evidence supports some of the theoretical pathways connecting the experience of low social position with poorer health via low control. There is a need for evidence on the impacts of actions to intervene in these pathways. Key messages Low control experienced in the day-to-day lives of people in lower social positions {{may play a role in}} determining the social gradient in health. Further high-quality empirical studies are needed to tease out the most important pathways leading from low control to health inequalities, to inform future public health strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The terminally {{differentiated}} adult cardiac myo-cyte cannot undergo cellular division. Growth of {{the heart}} in response to chronic hemodynamic overload therefore occurs through hypertrophy of the myocytes. The adapta-tion of the myocyte during hypertrophy not only involves an increase in cell size but also results in a change in pheno-type through modi~cation of the pattern of gene expres-sion. From in vitro studies, it can be learned that agonists like angiotensin-II, endothelin- 1, cardiotrophin, basic ~broblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, or stimulation with the a 1 -adrenergic agonist phenylephrine can induce hypertrophy. In vivo studies suggest that espe-cially angiotensin-II and endothelin- 1 play {{a prominent role in}} induction of hypertrophy during <b>overload.</b> These agonists <b>couple</b> to classical seven-transmembrane spanning domai...|$|R

40|$|The dual-career {{phenomenon}} {{has become increasingly}} prevalent worldwide. This lifestyle often generates stresses and strains, {{at home and at}} work, for couples juggling multiple demands, which can have negative consequences for organisations. While most empirical research into this lifestyle has been conducted in the United States and Britain, very little has been carried out in Australia. This particular study, based on data from an Australian sample of 121 lawyers and accountants, was therefore aimed at analysing the levels of stress, work-family conflict and overload among dual-career and single-career couples. The results confirm that dual-career couples experience higher levels of stress, work-family conflict and <b>overload</b> than single-career <b>couples.</b> To enhance labour productivity and organisational effectiveness, human resource managers therefore need to take account of the potential for dual-career stress, overload and conflict, and respond flexibly to dual-career employee status...|$|R
