5|$|A further {{fatality}} on Striding Edge in 1858 is commemorated by the Dixon Memorial. Robert Dixon from Patterdale {{was killed}} while following foxhounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, pitch pine, red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> include black huckleberry, lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper.|$|E
5|$|The top of Nescopeck Mountain was {{devoid of}} trees {{by the middle}} of the 1800s. Logging has been done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> in the early 2000s and plans have been made to {{construct}} communication towers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Local produce is sometimes traded over Nescopeck Mountain. The mountain is almost completely undeveloped.|$|E

5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of the morning, an {{infantry}} battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, took up defensive positions in the town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled to extricate them. The relief force was unable to advance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, Johnston was commemorated {{in several}} ways, {{including}} a memorial fund established {{in his name}} at the University of Washington to fund graduate-level research. Two volcano observatories were established and named after him: one in Vancouver, Washington, and another <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> where he died. Johnston's life and death are featured in several documentaries, films, docudramas and books. Along with others who died during the eruption, Johnston's name is inscribed on memorials dedicated to their memory.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to a perceived 'vacuous' personality and lack of intelligence, Ridge is a self-described 'nerd'. <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ridges,</b> both Ridge and Sally described Ridge as studious, and she is seen studying during a modelling job.|$|R

5|$|Four {{members of}} a Forward Observation Team from Battery C, 371st Field Artillery {{had been in the}} village when the Tank Destroyer unit withdrew. Lieutenant Warren Springer and the other three men, Sergeant Peter Gacki, T/4 Willard Wibben, and T/5 Billy Queen joined Bouck's unit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> where they could {{continue}} to observe the enemy movement. Bouck distributed them among the foxholes to help reload magazines and reinforce their position.|$|E
5|$|Several {{possible}} routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A bridleway winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to arrive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} capture the ridge {{had little effect on}} the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was so {{overwhelming}} that the Germans diverted significant resources, including two Panzer divisions, from the ridge in their attempt to keep Bradley's forces boxed in. With its defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, despite poor flying weather, {{an effort}} was made to air-drop {{ammunition}} to the Polish force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Learning that the Canadians had resumed their push and were making for Point 239, at 07:00 a platoon of the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron reconnoitered the German positions below the Zameczek.|$|E
5|$|Their {{defensive}} line, however, was incomplete, as {{the small}} village of Bréville-les-Monts, between the commandos and the 3rd Parachute Brigade, {{was held by}} the Germans. Located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> line it gave the Germans a view into Ranville, {{at the heart of}} the British position, the two captured bridges and in the distance Sword.|$|E
5|$|William Booth {{purchased}} Hadleigh Castle and {{its surrounding}} site in 1891 {{for the use of}} the Salvation Army, which established a farm to train the English poor prior to them being sent overseas to the British colonies. Considerable subsidence and slippage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> occurred between 1898 and 1923, causing a collapse of the southern curtain wall.|$|E

5|$|A {{battalion}} of the 3rd Parachute Division, {{along with an}} armoured regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division, now joined the assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> At 14:00 the 8th Infantry Battalion on the ridge's northern slopes once more came under attack. Although the infantry and armour {{closing in on the}} Polish positions were eventually repulsed, with a large number of prisoners being taken and artillery again causing significant casualties, the Poles were being gradually pushed back. However, they managed to retain their grip on Point 262N and with well-coordinated artillery fire continued to exact a toll on German units traversing the corridor. Another attempt was made to organise an attack towards Point 239 but the Germans were ready and the 9th Infantry Battalion's 3rd Company was driven back with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the third}} phase of the Passchendaele offensive, the 10th Australian Brigade—of which McGee's 40th Battalion was part—was {{detailed}} to execute an attack on Broodseinde Ridge. The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault, one for each battalion, with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> itself. The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06:00 on 4 October 1917, {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage. The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives, though the fighting intensified with each stage. As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the final objective, its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, as well as by barbed wire entanglements and sectors of impassable swamp.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sun rose}} on 14 September, pockets of Japanese {{soldiers}} remained scattered along {{both sides of the}} ridge. But with Tamura's battalion shattered after losing three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> had effectively ended. About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.|$|E

50|$|Around 1560-80, {{most of the}} citizens, some 8.000 people, {{still lived}} on Stadsholmen. This central island was at this time densely settled and the city was now {{expanding}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> surrounding <b>the</b> city. Stockholm had no private palaces at this time and the only larger buildings were the castle, the church, and the former Greyfriars monastery <b>on</b> Riddarholmen. <b>The</b> surrounding <b>ridges,</b> unable to boast a single timber framed building, were mostly used for activities that either required a lot of space, produced odours, or could cause fire. Even though some burghers had secondary residences outside the city, <b>the</b> population living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> perhaps {{a quarter of the}} city's population, were mostly poor, including the royal personnel occupying <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> north of <b>the</b> city.|$|R
25|$|The {{geological}} {{map shows}} basaltic andesite near Fisher Place, low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west <b>ridge</b> of Stybarrow Dodd, {{as well as}} small amounts of volcaniclastic deposits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>ridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|At 03:00 on 26 October, Oka's unit {{finally reached}} and {{attacked}} the Marine defenses near the Matanikau. Oka's troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken's battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken's Company F, which defended the extreme left {{flank of the}} Marine positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> A Company F machine gun section under Mitchell Paige killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners. At 05:00, Oka's 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the steep slope of the ridge and pushed the surviving members of Company F off the crest.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds {{was adamant}} that Verrières Ridge {{should be taken}} and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} the precarious Allied position. Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations {{and by the time}} the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> including a now secure position on Point67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E
5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> to the west.|$|E
