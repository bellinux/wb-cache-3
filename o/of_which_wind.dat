40|$|The {{complexity}} of the atmosphere endows it with the property of turbulence by virtue <b>of</b> <b>which,</b> <b>wind</b> speed variations in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) exhibit highly irregular fluctuations that persist {{over a wide range}} of temporal and spatial scales. Despite the large and significant body of work on microscale turbulence, understanding the statistics of atmospheric wind speed variations has proved to be elusive and challenging. Knowledge about the nature of wind speed at ABL has far reaching impact on several fields of research such as meteorology, hydrology, agriculture, pollutant dispersion, and more importantly wind energy generation. In the present study, temporal wind speed records from twenty eight stations distributed through out the state of North Dakota (ND, USA), (∼ 70, 000 square-miles) and spanning a period of nearly eight years are analyzed. We show that these records exhibit a characteristic broad multifractal spectrum irrespective of the geographical location and topography. The rapid progression of air masses with distinct qualitative characteristics originating from Polar regions, Gulf of Mexico and Northern Pacific account for irregular changes in the local weather system in ND. We hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for the observed multifractal structure could be the irregular recurrence and confluence of these three air masses...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, before {{reasonable}} {{financing for}} renewable energy is provided by local or international investors, adequate resource and viability assessments must be made, among many other policy initiatives and derivatives. For Nigeria, the national energy policy and the renewable energy master plan [3, 4] stipulate the country's desire to increase electricity production {{through the development of}} its alternative energy sources, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>wind,</b> solar and biogas are major. Thus, efforts at measuring and assessing these sources for electricity generation are vital to its energy development. Since wind resources are site specific, wind energy measurements of as many sites as possible are required to have a proper wind classification of a nation. Based on this, several studies have attempted to classify the wind profile characteristics of Nigeria either, by site, region, or nation [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Ajayi [5, 6] and Ohunakin et al. [9] profiled the results of some wind energy assessment studies in Nigeria to include those of pre- 2000 and few post- 2000 wind databases. On regional basis, different studies exist that characterized the wind profiles of sites in the North West [8, 9], North East [7, 8, 11], North Central [8, 10], South West [14] and South East [26] regions, respectively. Some recent studies also exist that profiled the wind characteristics of single sites in Nigeria [12, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23].|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} new analysis released {{earlier this}} month says that nearly half (49 %) of all recent tropical deforestation {{is the result of}} illegal clearing for commercial agriculture. The study also finds that around half of this illegal destruction was driven by overseas demand for agricultural commodities including palm oil, beef, soy, and wood products. In addition to devastating impacts on forest-dependent people and biodiversity, the illegal conversion of tropical forests for commercial agriculture is estimated to produce 1. 47 gigatonnes of carbon each year [...] equivalent to 25 % of the EU's annual fossil fuel-based emissions. The world must wake up to the scale of how much of this agricultural production is taking place on land that has been illegally cleared. According to the study 90 % of the deforestation in Brazil from 2000 to 2012 was illegal, primarily due to the failure to conserve a percentage of natural forests in large-scale cattle and soy plantations, as required by Brazilian law. (Much of this occurred prior to 2004, when the Brazilian government took steps to successfully reduce deforestation.) And in the forests of Indonesia, 80 % of deforestation was illegal [...] mostly for large-scale plantations producing palm oil and timber, 75 % of which is exported. While other countries also experience high levels of illegal deforestation, Brazil and Indonesia produce the highest level of agricultural commodities destined for global markets, many <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>wind</b> up in cosmetics or household goods (palm oil), animal feed (soy), and packaging (wood products) ...|$|E
40|$|Among {{renewable}} energy alternatives, wind power {{has proven to}} be a competitive alternative and a valuable contribution to energy systems. Further expansion of hydro power in Norway are becoming less desirable, both economically and environmentally. Norway is now becoming a net importer of electricity, if the electricity demand continues to increase. Norway’s energy policy is to be self-sufficient with electricity exclusively based on {{renewable energy}} resources. This calls for alternatives in addition to hydro power, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>wind</b> power shows to be the most promising [9]. Wind power in combination with hydro power Wind power and hydro power posses characteristics that are partly complementary. Hydro power (as the case for Norway) must be supported by water storage to fit with the demand. Norway consumes about 112 TWh of electricity per year. The water storage capacity is about 83 TWh, measured as the energy amount that can be produced when the water storage is filled [12]. This storage capacity is necessary in order to supply the energy demand during winter, when the consumption is at its peak. While hydro power shows a seasonal variation, wind power is intermittent over short periods, yet have a seasonal variation. Unlike hydro power, the production fits well with the yearly demand curve, and might reduce the need for water storage when combined with hydro power, allowing a better management of the water storage [2]. The dispersed population along the coast, also makes the electricity transmission system quite expensive. Energy losses in transmission are on average 10 percent of the total electricity production, from producer to consumer [1]. 2 Problem formulation Integrating wind power affects the electricity system in different ways. Some of the technical aspects are: • The need for water storage and its management • Transmission losses in the power gri...|$|E
40|$|The Lena Delta in the Laptev Sea in {{northern}} Siberia {{is the largest}} delta in the Arctic covering an area of about 32. 000 km². It is situated in the zone of continuous permafrost, but is also characterized by widespread thermokarst. For many years the interest of Russian and lately also German scientists (e. g. {{within the framework of}} the German-Russian research project System Laptev Sea 2000 supported by the BMBF) has been focused on the investigation of different problems concerning biology and geosciences in this area, which serves as an interface between the Siberian mainland and the Laptev Sea. The Lena Delta can be clearly divided into an active part in the East and a passive one in the West. Furthermore, a classification is made into three main terraces, which were formed during different stages since the late Pleistocene. The first and second terraces (early to late Pleistocene) were built by fluvial action of the Lena River. The third terrace consists of relicts of a late Pleistocene accumulation plain, which was enclosed by Holocene delta progression. In addition to about 800 channels, numerous lakes occur in the Lena Delta as characteristic landforms. These are not only relevant for the reconstruction of the paleoenvironment in this area, but also for todays delta geomorphology and ecology. The lakes are obviously of different genesis, e. g. thermokarst or abandoned channel lakes, which is important for balancing methane emissions in the Lena Delta as different lake types contribute different amounts of methane to the overall methane budget. Many of them have a clear orientation of their major axes tending in the same direction, most obvious on the second terrace. The phenomenon of oriented lakes described for many arctic coastal plains has not been fully explained yet despite intense research during the past decades. Different theories on the cause of orientation have been proposed, in most <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>wind</b> is seen as the main driving force. In order to generally quantify different lake types, to investigate possible ideas about their genesis, and to test tendencies of their orientation the lakes were analyzed using remote sensing methods and spatial statistics. All lakes > 20. 000 m² were included in the analysis (more than 2. 600 lakes). Their total area is ca. 1. 865 km² which is 6 % of the delta area. Investigations were made using a Geographical Information System (GIS) based on LANDSAT- 7 ETM+ satellite data. This allowed for an effective processing of the vast study area. We analyzed parameters describing lake morphometry (e. g. area, perimeter, different form indices, orientation of the major axis) as well as the spatial distribution of lakes throughout the delta area. That includes both the geographical position and the lakes geologic-geomorphologic unit within the delta. Based on this, correlations between several parameters were tested to investigate potentially predetermined patterns concerning lake morphogenesis and lake orientation. In order to test the wind hypothesis, morphometric data were combined with regional climate data...|$|E
