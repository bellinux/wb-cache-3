5|$|The {{federal tax}} credit for new plug-in {{electric}} vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 5 kWh, and the portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the total amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> allowed for a new PEV is $7,500.

They sued the New Jersey bank that had frozen their credit card merchant accounts; and they sued Chemical Bank in a similar suit.

5|$|Necrid's design {{targeted}} North American audiences, specifically fans of American comic books. Although McFarlane received most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the character, Necrid was {{the result}} of a collaboration; Namco outlined the then-unnamed character's traits, such as his in-game role and physical build, and McFarlane's company completed the design. As a result, both companies hold a partial copyright for Necrid, with Namco's rights to the character as a derivative work of McFarlane's illustrations.|$|E

5|$|RJR issued {{additional}} stock {{to the public}} in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.|$|E
5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E

5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit.</b> In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he had {{made an effort to}} run up a bigger score.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company.

KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E

5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November, after a night's chase, the British caught {{their opponents}} near Pelagosa. The French force {{consisted}} of the large frigates Pauline and Pomone, and the armed storeship Persanne. In the battle that followed, Unite pursued and, after a lengthy chase, seized the smaller Persanne, while Maxwell and James Alexander Gordon in Active engaged the frigates. The action was bitterly contested, the British taking 61 casualties, including Gordon who lost a leg. However, Alceste and Active successfully isolated Pomone, and when another British ship, , appeared in the distance, Pauline fled. Alone and having lost heavily, Pomone surrendered. The prizes were later sold along with their cargo of 200 cannon. Maxwell, despite attributing most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the victory to the wounded Gordon, was rewarded in 1812 with command of , a former Italian frigate captured at the Battle of Lissa.|$|E

5|$|On the Coalition side, Mack {{was given}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for Coburg's triumph. Blamed for the defeat, Miranda {{traveled}} to Paris to intrigue against Dumouriez. The Austro-Dutch reported losses of 97 officers, 2,762 {{rank and file}} and 779 horses. The French lost 4,000 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 men and 30 artillery pieces captured. General of Brigade Georges Guiscard de Bar was killed and four generals were wounded. Another source estimated Austrian losses as 2,600 killed and wounded and 400 missing while French casualties were 3,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 missing or prisoners. Immediately after the battle, about 6,000 French volunteers deserted the colors and went home. Three days later, Dumouriez's army only numbered about 20,000 troops as the men deserted in hundreds. On 23 March there was a clash at Pellenberg where Coburg with 38,000 soldiers defeated Dumouriez with 22,000. The Austrians sustained 900 casualties while inflicting 2,000 on the French.|$|E
5|$|One of Grant's actions {{during the}} siege was to settle a {{lingering}} rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the Battle of Arkansas Post. He had received permission to relieve McClernand in January 1863 but waited for an unequivocal provocation. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. He so diligently prepared his action that McClernand was left without recourse. McClernand's XIII Corps {{was turned over to}} Maj. Gen. Edward Ord, recovered from a wound sustained at Hatchie's Bridge. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote Texas.|$|E
5|$|Other early designs {{included}} Drum House, which boasted Scotland's first venetian window, and Mavisbank, both near Edinburgh. Mavisbank House, constructed between 1723 and 1727, was {{the first}} Palladian villa in Scotland, a collaboration between Adam and the owner, amateur architect Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The latter claimed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit,</b> and certainly criticised some of Adam's suggestions, although evidence suggests Adam got his way {{on a number of}} points. As at Hopetoun, here Adam enjoyed an unusually close relationship with his client, despite their differences of opinion. His most ambitious early work was the baroque, Vanbrugh-inspired house at Arniston, near Gorebridge. Built for Robert Dundas, a lawyer and politician linked to the Earl of Stair, Arniston includes extensive grounds laid out by Adam, with a parterre and cascade, and a main avenue centred on Arthur's Seat to the north. The stucco work to the hall at Arniston is one of Adam's finest Vanbrughian interiors.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for that victory came {{from the work of}} three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|The fledgling RAAF faced several {{challenges}} to its continued {{existence in the}} 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> for maintaining its independence. However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World WarII. Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again commanded the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation in Australia, and was knighted the year before his retirement in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Within Mississauga, {{the freeway}} {{encounters}} its narrowest right-of-way, sandwiched between residential subdivisions {{on either side}} that prevent further expansion. It crosses the Credit River Valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but, like the previous section, there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway427 at a large sprawling interchange. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the Humber River; this section was downloaded from provincial to municipal ownership on April1, 1997, and {{became part of the}} Gardiner Expressway.|$|E
