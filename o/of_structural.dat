40|$|Is the {{significant}} role <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> {{funds in the}} EU budget appropriate? The main goal of the thesis is to analyze the role and potential <b>of</b> the EU <b>structural</b> funds with a special focus on their use {{since the beginning of}} the economic integration of the EU until today and to answer the question raised. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter describes the historical evolution <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> funds in three phases in parallel with the deeper integration and extension of the EU. The second chapter is focused on the analyses of economic aspects <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> funds. Research on possible improvements <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> funds is presented in chapter three. Chapter four compares the structural funds management between France and Czech Republic. Chapter five provides insights into the upcoming 2014 - 2020 programming period. Based on the outcomes of the past evolution <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> funds, empirical experience of their usage in France and Czech Republic and in the context of the current financial crisis and rising euroscepticism, we predict the future evaluation and priority <b>of</b> the <b>structural</b> funds in the process of European integratio...|$|R
