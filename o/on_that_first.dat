5|$|Macdonald had favoured {{the union}} {{coming into force}} on 15 July, fearing that the {{preparations}} would not be completed any earlier. The British favoured an earlier date and, on 22 May, {{it was announced that}} the Dominion of Canada would come into existence on 1 July. Lord Monck appointed Macdonald as the new nation's first prime minister. With the birth of the Dominion, Canada East and Canada West became separate provinces, known as Quebec and Ontario. Macdonald was knighted <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> observance of what {{came to be known as}} Canada Day, 1 July 1867.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1995, the CAF had at its {{disposal}} 17 MiG-21s, five {{attack and}} nine transport helicopters, three transport airplanes and two reconnaissance aircraft. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day of the operation, thirteen MiG-21s were used to destroy or disable six targets in the Gospić and Zagreb Corps AORs, {{at the cost of}} one severely and three slightly damaged jets. The same day, three Mi-8s were used for medical evacuation. US Navy EA-6Bs and F/A-18s on patrol as part of Operation Deny Flight fired on ARSK surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites at Udbina and Knin as SAM radars locked onto the jets. A few sources claim that they were deployed as a deterrent as the UN troops came under HV fire, and a subsequent UN Security Council report only notes that the deployment was a result of the deterioration of the military situation and resulting low security of the peacekeepers in the area. Also on 4 August, the RSK 105th Air Force Brigade based at Udbina, deployed helicopters against the Croatian special police on Velebit Mountain and against targets in the Gospić area virtually to no effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech won the {{traditional}} pre-game coin toss and elected {{to kick off}} to Nebraska to begin the game. The Hokie kickoff was returned to the Nebraska 25-yard line, where the Cornhuskers ran the first play of the game. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> play, Frost completed a five-yard pass to Brendan Holbein. This was followed by two rushes by Benning, who picked up 18 yards and a first down in the process. Benning then crossed into the Virginia Tech half of the field with a five-yard rush. Frost then threw an incomplete pass, and Benning was unable to pick up another first down after gaining two yards on a pass from Frost. Nebraska punter Jesse Kosch came on to the field to punt to Virginia Tech. The kick sailed {{into the end zone}} for a touchback, and Virginia Tech began its first possession at its 20-yard line.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June, the 1st Battalion Battle Group assumed {{control of}} Pristina, {{the capital of}} Kosovo. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day, they {{had to deal with}} murder, kidnapping, torture, inter-communal gun-battles, house burnings, beatings, weapon finds and looting. The number of {{incidents}} reported required all the battalion's subunits. By the afternoon, there were no reserves left. To relieve the problem, an ad-hoc patrol of headquarters staff, including the padre, was formed to assist.|$|E
25|$|By 20:00, the 1/1 Marines had {{established}} defensive positions near the MACV Compound and a helicopter landing zone {{in a field}} {{just west of the}} Navy LCU Ramp in southern Huế. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day, the two Marine companies in Huế had sustained casualties of 10 Marines killed and 56 wounded. During the night, the battalion called in a helicopter into the landing zone to take out the worst of the wounded. The American command still had little realization of the situation in Huế.|$|E

25|$|In 1791-1792, Joseph Haydn {{accepted}} a lucrative offer from German impresario Johann Peter Salomon to visit England and conduct new symphonies with large orchestras. The visit {{was a huge}} success and generated {{some of his best}} known work. Another trip was therefore scheduled in 1794-1795. On that second occasion, Haydn met Dragonetti, who became a very good friend, and who visited him in Vienna in 1799. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> trip to Vienna, Dragonetti also met Beethoven in a famous encounter.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{examining}} the vagueness of the statute, the Court {{concluded that a}} law so indefinite as to permit the punishment of peaceful and orderly opposition exercised in accordance with legal means and constitutional imitations was “repugnant to the guarantee of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment.” In thus finding the first clause of the statute invalid, the Court set aside the conviction of the appellant, as the conviction appeared to have rested exclusively <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> clause. The Court did not proceed to rule on {{the constitutionality of the}} second and third clauses of the statute.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rest}} of its Front, the 321st participated in the Vistula-Oder Offensive. When the Front's attack began on January 14, 1945, 2nd Shock Army was tasked {{to break out of the}} Rozan {{bridgehead}} across the Narew River, with the immediate goal of taking the town of Ciechanow and then, in conjunction with 65th Army, to eliminate the enemy in the Pultusk area. The 321st, along with its corps, was in reserve, and did not see action <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day, nor the following. On the 17th, 2nd Shock liberated Ciechanow, but 116th Corps remained in second echelon.|$|E

25|$|For the commandos, the {{fighting}} was heaviest <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day. During {{the height of the}} German attack on the pass, G Troop from 'A' Battalion (No. 7 Commando), under Lieutenant F. Nicholls carried out a bayonet assault after a force of Germans took up a position on a hill on the Commando's left flank from where they began to enfilade the entire position. Twice the Germans came at them and each time the attack was turned back by stubborn defence. Elsewhere that same day, however, Laycock's headquarters was ambushed and in a rather confused action he and his brigade major, Freddie Graham, commandeered a tank in which they returned to the main body.|$|E

A variety of alternative covers were produced, including one by Juan Ortiz, a second cover by Stott exclusive to NerdBlock, separate retailer incentive versions by George Pérez and Tone Rodriguez, and a second cover by Pérez for subscribers. It sold 17,307 issues <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day of release, placing it in 144th highest sales for the month.

25|$|In 2009, Marie-José Malis toured, with a French-language version {{created with}} the help of Alain Badiou, {{explicitly}} asking whether there were any other possibility than the death of the Prince, and making discussion on the topic part of the experience of the play. The day before the staging in Arles, on May 14, 2009, she held a public discussion in the theatre, asking the public whether they had any suggestions as to how the play should end, as she herself was still undecided as to how to end the play. This fostering of discussion was itself an important element of the re-staging of the play. In the event, <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> night in Arles at least, the Prince and Natalia and a soldier friendly to their cause shoot {{their way out of the}} place in which the Prince is to be executed.|$|E

25|$|The first {{shots of}} the Burnside Expedition were fired on 7 February 1862, in the Battle of Roanoke Island. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day of the two-day battle, a force of 19 Union gunboats bombarded, rather inconclusively, four Rebel forts facing Croatan Sound and eight ships of the Confederate States Navy. The Federal ships were parts of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, {{commanded}} by Flag Officer Goldsborough. The Confederate vessels were drawn from a unit led by Flag Officer William F. Lynch, termed the Mosquito Fleet, intended to serve on Albemarle Sound and nearby waters. Two vessels of the Mosquito Fleet were not present: CSS Appomattox had been sent away to Edenton for supplies and did not return {{in time for the}} battle, and schooner CSS Black Warrior was left out, presumably because she lacked the mobility that steam power gave the rest of the fleet.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} kickoff, a 15-yard {{facemask}} penalty on Chargers linebacker Doug Miller gave San Francisco {{the ball at}} their own 41-yard line. Then on the third play of the drive, 49ers quarterback Steve Young threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice. The 49ers became the second team to take the opening kickoff and score a touchdown <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> drive (the first being the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VIII), and also set a new Super Bowl record for the fastest touchdown (later broken by the Chicago Bears' Devin Hester in Super Bowl XLI). After forcing the Chargers to punt, the 49ers advanced 79 yards in four plays, with Young rushing for 21 yards and then throwing a 51-yard touchdown pass to running back Ricky Watters to give San Francisco a 14–0 lead less than 5 minutes into the 1st quarter, and set a Super Bowl record for the fastest second touchdown scored by a team.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

Author Jonathan Gould views the song as [...] "darkly funny", with the singer's concern over his friends' tardiness almost resembling [...] "a metaphysical crisis". In the choruses, Harrison repeatedly urges [...] "Please don't be long / Please don't you be very long", a refrain that Inglis identifies as central to the composition's [...] "extraordinary sense of yearning and melancholy".|$|E

[...] Mellow explains that, <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>first</b> day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and Hemingway was returned to the Dorothea Dix.|$|E
