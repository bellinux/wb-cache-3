In this chapter, a novel wireless sleep apnea monitoring system is proposed to avoid uncomfortable sleep {{in an unfamiliar}} sleep laboratory in traditional PSG-based wired monitoring systems. In wireless sleep apnea monitoring system, signal propagation paths may be affected by fading because of reflection, diffraction, energy absorption, shadowing by the body, body movement, and the surrounding environment. To combat the fading effect in WBSN, the MIMO technology is introduced in this chapter. In addition, the presented active RFID based system is composed of two main parts.

By using state-of-art smartphones and <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors,</b> we implement a multi-modal system that collects a battery of features to better monitor in-person interactions. In addition, unlike existing work that monitors interactions only based on data collected from one person, we emphasize that in-person interactions intrinsically involve multiple participants, and thus we aggregate information from nearby people to identify more interaction details.

3000|$|In {{spite of}} their advantages, WBASNs face many issues, {{one of these is}} the limited energy [11] of both the <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors</b> and the in vivo pacemaker. The battery of the sensor/pacemaker {{exhausts}} quickly due to continuous communication. When the in vivo pacemaker or the sensor nodes deplete their energy, then it is either almost impossible (infeasible) to replace their batteries. In literature, many routing protocols have been proposed to prolong the battery lifetime of <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors</b> [12 – 14]. Similarly, many inductive links are designed to maximize the lifetime of pacemaker [15 – 17]. However, none of these works has jointly considered both problems. Thus, the motivation to enhance the lifetime of <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors</b> leads us to propose DARE and mutual information-based DARE (MI-DARE) routing protocols, and the motivation to recharge the implanted battery of pacemaker leads us to present a mathematical model for the non-invasive inductive link. However, patients under monitoring may show some degree of mobility such as postural changes of on-bed patients that may lead to topological changes and issues such as degradation in link quality and isolation of nodes from the network [18].

40|$|Abstract—Automatically {{recognizing}} {{human activities}} {{in a body}} sensor network (BSN) enables many human-centric applications. Many current works recognize human activities through collecting and analyzing sensor readings from <b>on-body</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes. These sensing-based solutions face a dilemma. On one hand, to guarantee data availability and recognition accuracy, sensing-based solutions have to either utilize a high transmission power or involve a packet retransmission mechanism. On the other hand, enhancing the transmission power increases a sensor node’s energy overheads and communication range. The enlarged communication range in consequence increases privacy risks. A packet retransmission mechanism complicates <b>on-body</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes ’ MAC layer and hence increases energy overheads. In contrast to the sensing-based solutions, we build RadioSense, a prototype system that exploits wireless communication patterns for BSN activity recognition. Using RadioSense, we benchmark three system parameters (transmission (TX) power, packet sending rate, and smoothing window size) to design algorithms for system parameter selection. The algorithms aim to balance accuracy, latency, and energy overheads. In addition, we investigate the minimal amount of training data needed for reliable performance. We evaluate our RadioSense system with multiple subjects ’ data collected over a two-week period and demonstrate that RadioSense achieves reliable performance in terms of accuracy, latency, and battery lifetime...|$|E

30|$|For HAR, {{there are}} two main types of sensors: ambient and <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors.</b> In terms of ambient sensors, the most widely used sensors are video cameras [13]. Video {{recording}} {{is one of the main}} strategies for supervising human behavior and activities [14]. But, this behavior can also be studied by analyzing acoustic events. The human activity can be characterized by defining the identity of sounds and their position in time sequence [15]. The main two disadvantages of ambient sensors are the requirement of infrastructure (for example, installation of video cameras in the monitoring areas) and also, people do not always stay all their time in the same environment. These limitations can be overtaken by <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors</b> [16, 17]. Body-worn sensors add new possibilities to the human monitoring system [18]: they allow measuring body signals (e.g. physiological, motion, location) and they are portable, allowing user supervision at any location without the need of fixed infrastructure. Because of these benefits, several works have been developed using motion sensors in different body parts (e.g. waist, wrist, chest and thighs) and achieved good classification performance [19 – 22].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A form of Telehealth is remote patient monitoring. We {{propose a}} generic {{topology}} {{for such a}} monitoring system and apply to it a physical layer cooperative transmission (CT) technique. The generic topology is as follows. We consider “on-body ” sensors, and a hub device (such as a phone, PDA, or wireless LAN access point) that is away from the body, which can function as a central fusion node and connect to the Internet. Using CT will reduce the total power required for sensor transmission by exploiting the spatial diversity of multiple single-antenna terminals. This will increase the longevity of battery-driven <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors.</b> The opportunistic large array (OLA) is a simple CT approach that saves energy relative to conventional multihop routing by allowing all nodes that can decode to relay the message. OLA avoids the overhead of assigning clusters and cluster leaders. To date, OLA has not been considered for human body applications. In this paper, we provide a first treatment of communication using OLA for <b>on-body</b> <b>sensors</b> in the Ultra-wideband (UWB) range and investigate the potential diversity gains that can be achieved...|$|R

To efficiently and safely perform these workflows is demanding on the workers, in particular when it comes to infrequent or repetitive tasks. This burden on the workers can be eased by introducing smart assistance systems. This article presents a scalable concept and an integrated system demonstrator designed for this purpose. The basic idea is to learn workflows from observing multiple expert operators and then transfer the learnt workflow models to novice users. Being entirely learning-based, the proposed system can be applied to various tasks and domains. The above idea has been realized in a prototype, which combines components pushing {{the state of the art}} of hardware and software designed with interoperability in mind. The emphasis of this article is on the algorithms developed for the prototype: 1) fusion of inertial and visual sensor information from an <b>on-body</b> <b>sensor</b> network (BSN) to robustly track the user’s pose in magnetically polluted environments; 2) learning-based computer vision algorithms to map the workspace, localize the sensor with respect to the workspace and capture objects, even as they are carried; 3) domain-independent and robust workflow recovery and monitoring algorithms based on spatiotemporal pairwise relations deduced from object and user movement with respect to the scene; and 4) context-sensitive augmented reality (AR) user feedback using a head-mounted display (HMD). A distinguishing key feature of the developed algorithms is that they all operate solely on data from the <b>on-body</b> <b>sensor</b> network and that no external instrumentation is needed.
