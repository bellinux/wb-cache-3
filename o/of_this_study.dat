40|$|<b>This</b> <b>studies</b> {{is about}} recommending {{food for the}} anemia patient by using rule base. Anemia is a blood {{disorder}} diseases which is having low iron level in the blood. The rule base technique is applied in <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> to recommend suitable food for the anemia patient, as the anemia patient having problem to consume food that can help to increase the iron level in the blood. The aim <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is to develop the prototype for recommending food for the anemia patient by using rule base. The first objective <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is to gathered food information from the dietician, an interview {{is being held in}} order to get further information and a better understanding about Malaysian foods. The second objective <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is to analyse the relationship between the suitable food and the preferences of the animatic user by using rule based. The third objective is to create and embedded the rules to the prototype to recommends foods to the animatic users. <b>This</b> <b>studies</b> consists <b>of</b> four phases for methodology, which is data gathering, data analysis, design and implementation. In the first phases, which are data gathering, interview with the dietician is conducted to gather the information regarding the food information as well as the iron level needed daily for the anemia patient. Data analysis is the second phases <b>of</b> methodology in <b>this</b> <b>studies,</b> the gathered data is being analyse and preprocess to produce cleaned data. The third phases is design, the design of the database, interface of the prototype is being done in this phase. The last phases is implementation which are implementing the generated rule base for recommending food to the anemia patient to the prototype. The phases <b>of</b> <b>this</b> methodology is to achieve the objective <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> and fulfilled the aim <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>studies.</b> The final result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is the developed system prototype is able to recommend suitable food for the anemia patient base on the animatic preferences...|$|R
