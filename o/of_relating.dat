25|$|Generation {{of written}} {{language}} {{is thought to}} be closely related to speech generation, relying on Broca's area for early processing and on the inferior frontal gyrus for semantic processing. However, writing differs in two major ways. First, instead <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> the thought to sounds, the brain must relate the thought to symbols or letters, and second, the motor cortex activates a different set of muscles to write, than when speaking.|$|E

Dean did go to Camp David and performed some work on this report, but since {{he was one of the}} cover-up's chief participants, this report-writing task placed him in the difficult position <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> his own involvement, as well as that of others, and he correctly concluded he was being fitted for the role of scapegoat in the cover-up by those higher up.

25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} {{to be open to}} the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way <b>of</b> <b>relating,</b> this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
25|$|When Bernini {{was invited}} to Paris in 1665 to prepare works for Louis XIV, he {{presented}} designs for the east facade of the Louvre Palace, but his projects were ultimately turned down in favour of the more sober and classic proposals of the French doctor and amateur architect Claude Perrault, signaling the waning influence of Italian artistic hegemony in France. Bernini's projects were essentially rooted in the Italian Baroque urbanist tradition <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> public buildings to their settings, often leading to innovative architectural expression in urban spaces like piazze or squares. However, by this time, the French absolutist monarchy now preferred the classicising monumental severity of Perrault's facade, no doubt with the added political bonus {{that it had been}} designed by a Frenchman. The final version did, however, include Bernini's feature of a flat roof behind a Palladian balustrade.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} dynamic {{bidirectional}} relationship between firm R&D intensity and corporate diversification, using longitudinal data of Spanish manufacturing companies. Our empirical approach {{takes into account}} the censored nature of the dependent variables and the existence of firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity. Whereas we find a positive linear effect of R&D intensity on related diversification, the evidence about the effect <b>of</b> <b>related</b> diversification on R&D intensity takes the form of an inverted U. Hence, the effect <b>of</b> <b>related</b> diversification on R&D intensity is positive but marginally decreasing for moderate levels <b>of</b> <b>related</b> diversification, but such effect can turn out negative for high levels <b>of</b> <b>related</b> diversification. Additionally, the consequences of the dynamic relation are that the effects are substantially larger in the long-run than in the short-run. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} part, Henriquez’ brother, Myrtano, succeeds as Idalia’s {{principal}} adorer, and she reciprocates his love. She then receives a letter informing her about Myrtano’s engagement to another woman, so she leaves for Verona, hoping {{to enter a}} convent. On the road her guide takes her to a rural retreat {{with the intention of}} killing her, but she escapes to Ancona from where she takes ship for Naples. The sea captain pays her crude court, but just in time to save her from his embraces the ship is captured by corsairs commanded by a young married couple. Though the heroine is in peasant dress, she is treated with distinction by her captors. Her history moves them to tears and they in turn are in the midst <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> to Idalia the involved story of their courtship when the vessel is wrecked in a gale.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{developed from}} the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT {{is based on the}} theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being. There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.|$|E

500|$|In his 1978 {{biography}} of Victor Trumper, Fingleton accused Bradman <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> Woodfull's {{words to the}} press. Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him. In Fingleton's version of events, Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting. Bradman wrote for Corbett's paper, Sydney's Sun. Sitting in Corbett's car, Bradman told the journalist about the Warner–Woodfull incident. Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself, so shared it with other journalists. Fingleton later added that [...] "Bradman would have saved {{me a lot of}} backlash... had he admitted that he had given the leak.

500|$|The conceit <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> {{different}} women to different {{animals in the}} poem is not an invention of Semonides, but {{seems to have been}} based on a pre-existing folk tale. [...] Aesop's fables were attributed in ancient Greece to the sixth-century BCE slave of that name, but many of them are likely to be much older than that; one of these fables, that of Zeus and Prometheus, has a similar premise to Semonides' poem, and may have been known to him. [...] Later poets tell similar stories, probably also inspired by these folktales. [...] An elegiac fragment by Phocylides describes women as having originated from one of four different creatures, all of which are also found in Semonides' poem; similar stories are found in poems by Callimachus and Horace.|$|E

500|$|A {{line in the}} epistle, [...] "For {{the word}} of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword" [...] (...) , {{possibly}} prompted {{the choice of the}} hymn. The unknown poet of the cantata text kept stanzas 1, 3, 6 and 7 unchanged, expanding 3 by recitative, and reworded 2, 4 and 5 for the respective movements of the cantata. The topic of the gospel is God's word, as Jesus explains in verse 11, [...] "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.", which is mentioned in the first line of the hymn, [...] "bei deinem Wort" [...] (close to your word). Instead <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> closely to the parable, the poet concentrates on a general request to God: to keep his people faithful to his word, to protect them from enemies and to provide peace.|$|E
500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind <b>of</b> <b>relating</b> to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E

She praised Evancho's voice but thought that some of the song choices were odd, and that sometimes [...] "it was difficult to understand the lyrics." [...] She felt that Evancho sounded more comfortable in her classical selections, but that pop songs require [...] "a different vocal technique with more emphasis on the lyrics ... she has to watch her phrasing ... breathe in the right places, and find the deeper meaning and longing that the song expresses." ...|$|E
