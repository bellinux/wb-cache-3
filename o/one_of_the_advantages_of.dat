5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{linezolid}} is {{its high}} bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it}} had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of}} a seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E

5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{solid biomass}} fuel {{is that it}} is often a byproduct, residue or waste-product of other processes, such as farming, animal {{husbandry}} and forestry. In theory, this means fuel and food production do not compete for resources, although this is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} uses of scopes is troubleshooting malfunctioning electronic equipment. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> a scope {{is that it can}} graphically show signals: where a voltmeter may show a totally unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.|$|E
30|$|In the literature, {{there are}} two {{existing}} works to reversibly hide data into Homomorphic encrypted image [25, 26] by using Paillier cryptosystem (which is a public key cryptosystem with both homomorphic and probabilistic properties). With Paillier cryptosystem, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> is that <b>the</b> encrypted image can be processed by the third party in encrypted domain.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{algorithms}} {{have been developed}} to merge the range data retrieved from multiple angles of a single object to produce complete 3-D models with as little error as possible. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> that laser rangefinders offer over other methods of computer vision is that the computer does not need to correlate features from two images to determine depth information as in stereoscopic methods.|$|R
50|$|Globalization {{has made}} for a decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EUR/EPAL system since the EUR-pallets do not fit well into ISO containers. It {{is still the most}} {{widespread}} pallet type in the world, with an estimate of 350 to 500 million EUR-pallets being in circulation. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> is that <b>the</b> 800 mm width fits through normal doors (the most common DIN door type is 850 mm by 2000 mm).|$|R
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> DNA {{vaccines}} is {{that they}} are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner that appears to mimic natural infection. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{this method}} is that any sample {{provides}} two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 703 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination {{of the age of}} the sample even if some of the lead has been lost.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> Coase's {{model is}} that it {{suggests}} that fairness (equity) can be addressed {{in the distribution of}} property rights, and that regardless of how these property rights are assigned, the market will produce the most efficient outcome (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.29). In reality, according to the held view, markets are not perfect, and it is therefore possible that a trade off will occur between equity and efficiency (Halsnæs et al.., 2007).|$|E

A regularized solution is constructed {{based on the}} Green's function. The existence and uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regularized solution are proved and the convergence estimates are provided under a simple choice of regularization parameter.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the plug-in hybrid {{design is}} that the {{generator}} can be completely decoupled from the traction. Unlike a conventional engine, which operates over {{a wide variety of}} power settings and operational conditions, the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times. High-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for PEV use. These include advanced close-cycle steam engines, stirling engines, Wankel engines, and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small size.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{testicular}} cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the most}} popular style is the sled-foot trestle base. With this design, each pair of legs is put {{together}} {{in the form of}} an 'I' with two vertical bars. The leg pairs are connected by a pair of stretchers. These stretchers can be permanently fixed to the leg-pairs, or they can be made removable with tusk tenons or a bed-bolt arrangement. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> this style is that there is no end-grain resting on the floor, so the legs are not as prone to wick-up moisture and rot.|$|E

25|$|Fireforce was an {{operational}} assault or response usually {{composed of a}} first wave of 32 soldiers carried to the scene by three Alouette III helicopters and one Dakota transport aircraft, with another Alouette III helicopter as a command/gunship aircraft and a light attack aircraft in support. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the Fireforce was its flexibility as all that was needed was a reasonable airstrip. It was such a successful tactic that some Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) soldiers reputedly made {{as many as three}} parachute combat jumps in one day.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 9000 BC both grain and cattle {{were used as}} money or as barter (Davies) (the first grain remains found, {{considered}} to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC). Some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals, such as camels and goats, {{may have been used}} as currency {{in some parts of the}} world. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> using cattle as currency is that it allows the seller to set a fixed price. It even created the standard pricing. For example, two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens.|$|E

25|$|The Gothic {{style of}} figure {{painting}} began {{to give way}} to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such engravings. The works of Albrecht Dürer were much admired. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of Mayer of Munich which influenced English designers towards this style.|$|E
25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} sleep mode {{in which the}} processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> sleep mode over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system in sleep mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in sleep mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in sleep mode results in data loss, while cutting {{the power of a}} system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the power is restored. Both shut down and hibernated systems may consume standby power unless they are unplugged.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of relayed VHF stations proved {{the reliability of}} unmanned stations, and the Telecommunications Administration started a process to unman the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one person would be a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations {{there was only one}} employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had local knowledge. Operators were often {{from other parts of the}} country and typically did not have sufficient local knowledge for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference. Search and rescue operations would always be coordinated by the police and not the coast station.|$|E
