40|$|Abstract. Scientific {{experimental}} data generated {{by all the}} bionomic technologies is characterized by heterogeneity in its representation formats, constituents, and generation processes and, therefore, also in its usage. Using the proteomics domain we demonstrate {{the important role of}} provenance information <b>o</b> <b>manage,</b> interpret and analyze {{experimental data}}. We present a novel approach that employs an ontology as a knowledge model to automatically create semantic provenance information for high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) data in the glycoproteomics domain. The Semantic Provenance Annotation of Data in protEomics (SPADE) implementation is based on the ProPreO ontology, a large-process ontology (~ 500 classes, 40 named relationships with 170 class-level restrictions, and 3. 1 million instances) that models the complete experimental protocol for MS-based glycoproteomics data analysis. The semantic provenance information created in SPADE enables biologists to query over the semantic provenance information and retrieve exact data using “train-of-thought ” expressive queries in SPARQL query language. We also discuss our current work in extending the ProPreO ontology to support toxicological metabolomics experimentation using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our strategic goal is to use Semantic Provenance information by pattern recognition and data mining algorithms for comparative or correlation analysis of Liquid Chromatography MS (LCMS) and NMR spectroscopy experimental data as part of toxicological metabolomics studies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Biotechnology {{represents}} {{a new generation}} of scien-tific and technological advancements, and has the potential to result in profound changes in twenty-first century agriculture. Since the general public are the consumers of biotechnology products, public acceptance is vital. This article presents the results of a survey of a random sample of Texas residents on two significant issues. First, to what extent is the general public supportive of biotechnology, and second, are there some segments of the population that are more supportive of biotechnology than other segments. Survey results make it apparent that the Texas general public has a clear mandate about two aspects of biotechnology. First, there is widespread sup-port for research on plant biotechnology and the resulting products. A second clear mandate was that the public was adamantly opposed to research on human cloning. Respondent's views about animal bio-technology were split, with about equal numbers favoring and oppos-ing research on animal biotechnology and the resulting products. Respondents most favorable to biotechnology included older people, males, persons with more education and higher incomes, those with more faith in science and technology, and those who perceive posi-tive outcomes from biotechnology. Some implications of these fmd-ings are discussed. Throughout U. S. history, developments in science and technology have {{had a profound impact on}} agriculture, farm families and rural communities (Cochrane 1979). During the twentieth century, mechanical developments in agriculture increased farm production and allowed the more efficient use o f human labor, which made it possible for farmers t <b>o</b> <b>manage</b> larger operations (Dorner 1983). This resulted in larger and fewer farms, a rapid reduction in the farm population, and extensive changes in rural communities (Albrecht and Murdock 1990). However, by the latter decades o f the 20 Ih century it was clear that the steady increases in productivity occurring as a result of these mechanical developments were leveling off a s efficiency scales an...|$|E
40|$|In {{the year}} of 2009 the {{conditions}} for managing primary healthcare {{in the region of}} Västra Götaland changed. The decision was taken by the regional assembly and resulted in that the citizens since then have had the o pportunity to choose whic h health care provider they prefer to stay with. Along with this decision a new market for private health care providers was established, which resulted in increased competition between the providers. In order t <b>o</b> <b>manage</b> the competi tion, the health care providers are now forced to be more efficient in their operations and also to be even more focused on their patients. Backa Läkarhusgruppen {{is an example of a}} private healthcare provider in the region of Västra Götaland. I n the same w ay it is also an example of an organization in need of analys ing their operations to see how it can be further optimized to meet patient needs and expectations. The aim of this study is to analys e Backa Läkarhusgruppen’s organization and its operations i n the hope of find ing suggestions which will improve the patient flow. To allocate and solve the problems that Backa Läkarhus suffer from, an approach inspired by Lean Healthcare is used throug hout the report. Some of the most significant problems that wer e identified within the organization are: ● The synchronization of demand and capacity is inadequate. ● Absence of standardized routines. ● Absence of present leadership. To be able to improve the patient flow Backa Läkarhus needs to handle these identified p roblem areas. By synchronizing the staffing level in relation to the trends in demand a reduction in the patient’s waiting times and throughput time will be possible. Creating clear responsibilities and routines for the staff will contribute to a higher de gree of patient focus and thus lead to a more efficient patient flow. A proposal to the leaders within the organization is to be come more present in the daily operations and thereby obtain a greater understanding for their own organization.

40|$|Emissions of {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 <b>O)</b> from <b>managed</b> and grazed grasslands on peat soils are amongst the highest {{emissions}} in the world per unit of surface of agriculturally managed soil. According to the IPCC methodology, the direct N 2 <b>O</b> emissions from <b>managed</b> organic soils {{is the sum of}} N 2 O emissions derived from N input, including fertilizers, urine and dung of grazing cattle, and a constant ‘background’ N 2 O emission from decomposition of organic matter that depends on agro-climatic zone. In this paper we questioned the constant nature of this background emission from peat soils by monitoring N 2 O emissions, groundwater levels, N inputs and soil NO 3 -–N contents from 4 grazed and fertilized grassland fields on managed organic peat soil. Two fields had a relatively low groundwater level (‘dry’ fields) and two fields had a relatively high groundwater level (‘wet’ fields). To measure the background N 2 O emission, unfertilized sub-plots were installed in each field. Measurements were performed monthly and after selected management events for 2 years (2008 – 2009). On the managed fields average cumulative emission equaled 21 ± 2 kg N ha- 1 y- 1 for the ‘dry’ fields and 14 ± 3 kg N ha- 1 y- 1 for the ‘wet’ fields. On the unfertilized sub-plots emissions equaled 4 ± 0. 6 kg N ha- 1 y- 1 for the ‘dry’ fields and 1 ± 0. 7 kg N ha- 1 y- 1 for the ‘wet’ fields, which is below the currently used estimates. Background emissions were closely correlated with groundwater level (R 2 = 0. 73) and accounted for approximately 22 % of the cumulative N 2 O emission for the dry fields and for approximately 10 % of the cumulative N 2 O emissions from the wet fields. The results of this study demonstrate that the accuracy of estimating direct N 2 O emissions from peat soils can be improved by approximately 20 % by applying a background emission of N 2 O that depends on annual average groundwater level rather than applying a constant valu...|$|R
