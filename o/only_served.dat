5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and <b>only</b> <b>served</b> {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the new El 13 {{locomotives}} were delivered, and locomotive-hauled express trains {{replaced the}} multiple units.

5|$|In {{response}} to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which <b>only</b> <b>served</b> {{as a pretext}} to worsen relations. On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the German minority would vote on secession. The Poles refused {{to comply with the}} German demands and on the night of 30–31 August in a violent meeting with the British ambassador Neville Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{was born}} in Hingham, on May 15, 1749, to Enoch and Rachel (Fearing) Lincoln. His father first apprenticed him to a local blacksmith, but the boy's lack of {{interest}} in that business and clear interest in reading led to his eventual enrollment in Harvard College. He graduated in 1772, and studied law under Joseph Hawley in Northampton. When news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord reached Northampton, he volunteered for military service, but <b>only</b> <b>served</b> for a short time, marching with the local militia to Cambridge, where militia were besieging British-occupied Boston.|$|E
5|$|López de Salcedo {{was under}} orders to {{investigate}} the state of affairs in the troubled province, and take whatever actions were necessary to impose order. He and his immediate successors promoted their own personal ambitions over the good government of Honduras, sowing division amongst the colonists, and instituting harsh policies against the indigenous population. In 1527 the natives rebelled against their brutal treatment. The punishment meted out to the rebellious Indians <b>only</b> <b>served</b> to incite further revolts. López de Salcedo arrested Saavedra and his supporters and shipped them to Santo Domingo to be tried by the Audiencia. The prisoners seized control {{of the ship and}} sailed for Cuba.|$|E

5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system <b>only</b> <b>served</b> to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November, he {{was sworn}} in as a Privy Counsellor. He {{suspended}} his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, due to an old custom that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when it was empty. He <b>only</b> <b>served</b> until 8 April, and {{there is no evidence of}} his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties. He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.|$|E
5|$|The new tracks {{built by}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway allowed {{additional}} intermediate stations to be constructed on the local lines between 1932 and 1935. Increased local demand {{was caused by the}} expansion of the built up area of suburban London during the interwar period. The station at Upminster Bridge opened with platforms on the local electric lines on 17 December 1934. The station was operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but was <b>only</b> <b>served</b> by District line trains. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground.|$|E
