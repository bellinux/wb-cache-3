5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor that turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true),</b> Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E

American press reports from the European theater foretold the imminent fall of the Third Reich, and many men in Lt. Col.

25|$|As {{a result}} of his disappointing season at Villarreal, he agreed with the club in June 2008, to search the market for a {{possible}} transfer.

The speculations, however soon turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> In July 2008, he left Villarreal on a free transfer, and returned to Feyenoord on a new three-year contract. Here he got off to a great start with four goals in three games. But unfortunately this was followed by a long time injury from the end of September until the end of January. And because of that, he could only play a total of 14 games for Feyenoord in 2008–09.|$|E

This turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> however, and he inherited from Bergkamp the famous number 10 shirt, which is often given to playmakers. He went on to score 26 goals in the 1993–94 season, becoming the league's top scorer, and leading Ajax to the title. He was also voted Footballer of the Year in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E

25|$|Ridgway began each {{murder by}} picking up a woman, usually a sex worker. He {{sometimes}} showed the woman {{a picture of his}} son, to trick her into trusting him. After raping her, Ridgway strangled her from behind. He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgway began using ligatures. He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area. In the early 1980s, the King County Sheriff's Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were Robert Keppel and Dave Reichert, who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy in 1984. Bundy offered his opinions on the psychology, motivations, and behavior of the killer; he suggested that the killer was revisiting the dump sites to have sexual relations with his victims, which turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> and if police found a fresh grave, they should stake it out and wait for him to come back. Also contributing to the investigation was John E. Douglas, who has since written much {{on the subject of the}} Green River Killer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as he walked out of the arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he got in the way of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E
