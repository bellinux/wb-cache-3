5|$|Forman {{based his}} story on a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> create a real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on {{a considerable amount of}} dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Fish minigame {{involves}} manipulating a fish {{to collect}} every coin in its tank. The fish moves {{in a straight}} diagonal line, and the player can alter this line by placing bubbles at certain marked points, reflecting {{it in a different}} direction. In the Japanese version of Last Specter, the Fish minigame is instead based <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> create words by feeding them to fish, who alter them in specific patterns.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{information}} from Black, Mulder concentrates <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find Johnson, when Scully is attacked {{in the morgue}} by the dead deputy; Johnson saves her by shooting the deputy, before disappearing. The two agents put all their effort in to finding Johnson {{before it is too}} late. Mulder breaks into Johnson's house but is locked by Johnson in his basement, where he is attacked by the four corpses of the FBI agents; he manages to shoot and kill one of them. Frank shows up; after tying up Johnson, Frank shoots two of the zombies in the head. As his gun runs out of bullets and death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|For {{the album}} session, Steve Albini was engineer, Josephine Wiggs {{replaced}} Halliday on bass, Britt Walford played drums, and both Deal and Donelly played guitar. Following {{two weeks of}} practicing in England, the Breeders recorded Pod at the Palladium studio in Scotland. Albini recorded the group quickly, and focused more on getting good sounds from the musical equipment than <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> improve the musicians' performances. Critics have discussed similarities between Pod and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{pulled out}} of the match against Lithuania, so younger players could gain more {{international}} experience, and to allow him to focus <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> win Grand Slam titles. His absence was criticised by Davis Cup captain John Lloyd. The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs; fielding a team of teenagers, but Lithuania won 3–2. This {{was the first time that}} Great Britain had lost five ties in a row and was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain. It led to the resignation of John Lloyd as Davis Cup captain, with Britain now threatened with relegation to the lowest tier of the competition.|$|E

50|$|Perceptual {{enhancement}}: Perceptual enhancement {{is a part}} of the decoder which, when turned <b>on,</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> reduce (the perception of) {{the noise}} produced by the coding/decoding process.

5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{convey a sense}} of the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips that {{emphasized}} mild sadomasochism and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> shade in his mouth and simply outlining it.|$|E
5|$|Anderson had a final {{meeting with}} the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska, but the Nazi {{government}} had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson's identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned. The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken. In 1939, World War II began with Germany's attack on the western half of Poland. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all his own money <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> obtain the Tsar's non-existent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of Saxe-Meiningen, in what became the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946, Prince Frederick of Saxe-Altenburg helped her across the border to Bad Liebenzell in the French occupation zone.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1170s Henry focused <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> create a stable system of government, {{increasingly}} ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately {{leading to a}} fresh revolt. Having quelled the left-over rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179. In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was {{able to deal with}} the remaining disturbances on his own. John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began to regard the prince as Henry's favourite child. Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' expense, and in 1177 made him the Lord of Ireland. Meanwhile, Young Henry spent {{the end of the decade}} travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly dissatisfied with his position and lack of power.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. It {{resulted}} in massive territorial losses for Russia, with 26% {{of the former}} Empire's population, 37% of its agricultural harvest area, 28% of its industry, 26% of its railway tracks, and three-quarters of its coal and iron deposits being transferred to German control. Accordingly, the Treaty was deeply unpopular across Russia's political spectrum, and several Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries resigned from Sovnarkom in protest. After the Treaty, Sovnarkom focused <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> foment proletarian revolution in Germany, issuing an array of anti-war and anti-government publications in the country; the German government retaliated by expelling Russia's diplomats. The Treaty nevertheless failed to stop the Central Powers' defeat; in November 1918, the German Emperor Wilhelm II resigned and the country's new administration signed the Armistice with the Allies. As a result, Sovnarkom proclaimed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk void.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E

5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E
5|$|When Susan's husband, Karl, is {{suspected}} of causing {{the death of a}} patient, he decides to move their family to Erinsborough for a fresh start. As Susan settles into Ramsay Street, she hopes to get back into teaching. Susan gets involved in the drama society and works at the Coffee Shop for Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies). Karl wants to have another child, but Susan is opposed to the idea. She later decides that she wants to return to teaching and is given a job at Erinsborough High. Susan chaperones Brett Stark (Brett Blewitt) on a trip to South Africa and she confesses to him that she helped her mother to die. Susan invites Billy's best friend, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to move in and he becomes a surrogate son after Malcolm leaves. Susan is offered the position of principal at a school in Wangaratta and she accepts, knowing that she will have to leave her family. After a few months, Susan is offered the job of principal at Erinsborough High. While Susan is away, Karl kisses his receptionist, Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles). Susan learns the truth about the kiss several months later from Billy and she confronts Karl. He admits to the kiss and Susan slaps him; she then throws him out. It takes months before Susan forgives Karl, but they work <b>on</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> save their marriage by attending counselling.
