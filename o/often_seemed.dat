25|$|There was extreme {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{marriage}} “registry offices” of the time. Couples, who could not or would not use clerical celebrants, were humiliated by perfunctory and undignified ceremonies. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, the major denominations of the time, discouraged or forbad remarriage of divorced people; and the offensively dismissive marriages offered by the state in registry offices <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> designed {{to add to the}} distress of couples who were defying their own church's rules.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December 1839 he {{ascended the}} Danish throne as Christian VIII. The Liberal party had high hopes of “the giver of constitutions,” but he {{disappointed}} his admirers by steadily rejecting every Liberal project. Administrative reform {{was the only}} reform he would promise. In his attitude to the growing national unrest in the twin duchies of Schleswig and Holstein he <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> hesitated and half-hearted, which damaged his position there. It was not until 1846 that he clearly supported the idea of Schleswig being a Danish area.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{there has}} never been a {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party. All major American political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the pursuit of happiness, the rule of law, the consent of the governed, opposition to aristocracy, and fear of corruption, coupled with equal rights. Political divisions inside the United States <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|From the Bolson, the Comanche {{branched}} {{out in all}} directions in small and large groups to raid into tropical Mexico {{as far south as}} Jalisco and Querétaro. Each warrior took three or four horses with him, saving his favorite for battle. Women and children commonly traveled with the men and were prepared to defend themselves if necessary. A weakness of the Comanche was their determination to recover the bodies of their fallen warriors. They took extreme risks and suffered additional casualties as a result. Moreover, they <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> careless and were sometimes caught unawares by large contingents of Mexican soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Cohen, in {{his essay}} 'Complete Bullshit', has cited the 'Althusserian school' {{as an example of}} 'bullshit' and a factor in his co-founding the 'Non-Bullshit Marxism Group'. He says that 'the ideas that the Althusserians generated, for example, of the {{interpellation}} of the subject, or of contradiction and overdetermination, possessed a surface allure, but it <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> impossible {{to determine whether or not}} the theses in which those ideas figured were true, and, at other times, those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations: on one of them they were true but uninteresting, and, on the other, they were interesting, but quite obviously false'.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{continued}} his campaign against any further {{transfer of power}} to Indian natives. He continued to predict conflict in India and mass unemployment at home. His speeches often quoted nineteenth-century politicians and his own policy was to maintain the existing Raj. In pursuing this campaign Churchill cut himself off from the mainstream of Conservative politics as much as {{from the rest of}} the political world. Younger Conservatives such as Duff Cooper, who later described Churchill's campaign as the most unfortunate event that occurred between the two wars, and Harold Macmillan saw Churchill as a reactionary, someone who was completely out of touch and at base, undemocratic - leaning towards the totalitarian regimes. Churchill's public comments <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> that way.|$|E
25|$|The purely {{scientific}} side of Grimm's character developed slowly. He {{seems to}} have felt the want of definite principles of etymology {{without being able to}} discover them, and indeed even in the first edition of his grammar (1819) he <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> to be groping in the dark. As early as 1815 we find August Wilhelm von Schlegel reviewing the Altdeutsche Wälder (a periodical published by the two brothers) very severely, condemning the lawless etymological combinations it contained, and insisting on the necessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation of the laws of language, especially in the correspondence of sounds. This criticism is said to have had a considerable influence on the direction of Grimm's studies.|$|E
25|$|For Middlesex, Robertson <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> {{similarly}} {{overshadowed by}} the batting of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich. Yet {{in the summer of}} 1947, when Compton’s 3,816 runs and Edrich’s 3,539 set new records for run-getting, Robertson was not far behind, making 2,760 runs with 12 centuries. He surpassed that in 1951 with 2,917 runs, the highest aggregate of any batsman that season. He could also bat as entertainingly as his better-known county colleagues. In 1949, he made an undefeated 331 in a day against Worcestershire at New Road, Worcester, an innings that remains the highest scored in first-class cricket by a Middlesex batsman, and the highest first-class innings by any batsman at New Road.|$|E

25|$|In the {{commercial}} {{rhythm and blues}} music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, and saxophone. Arrangements were rehearsed {{to the point of}} effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.|$|E
500|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of the Union Cavalry in the East was chaotic. At {{the beginning of the}} Civil War, officers were elected by the men or appointed politically. This resulted in many misguided and inept commanders. The tools and techniques of pre-war cavalry <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> inadequate, resulting in a steep learning curve that was costly in men and supplies. Slowly out the chaos came the tactics and leaders who proved worthy of the challenge. Union [...] "horse soldiers" [...] became cavalry troopers under this tough regimen and proved adept, dismounted and mounted on horseback, with their carbines, pistols, sabers and confident under their battle-proven leaders.|$|E
500|$|Raich Carter {{once said}} of Frank Swift {{that he looked}} so big in goal that as a forward it <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> that trying to score against him {{was like trying to}} put the ball into a matchbox. Swift's hands, which had a finger span of , were {{sufficiently}} large for him to easily pick up the ball with one hand, and gave rise to the nickname [...] "Frying Pan Hands". Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him {{to see if he was}} at fault.|$|E

500|$|The BBC's own website {{regarded}} Quatermass II unfavourably when reviewing its DVD {{release in}} 2005. [...] "The script {{is too often}} let down by the production's rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there's Monica Gray [...] — less an actress than a finishing school on legs." [...] Writing in The Times in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial. [...] "Quatermass, for instance, <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in Quatermass II, the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. 'They’re coming in their thousands,' he says, 'this is it.'" [...] However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is undermined in episode five where an Irish immigrant helps Quatermass sabotage the aliens' food supply system. In any case, it is in direct contrast with Kneale's deliberate attack on racial intolerance in Quatermass and the Pit.|$|E
500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least she knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E
500|$|Howe favoured {{as quick}} a {{transition}} to a peacetime economy as possible. Most industries in which there were not shortages were released from government controls in late 1945. Labour leaders, fearing unemployment, wanted to keep wartime government plants in production; Howe opposed such proposals. When union members who were laid off from the Research Enterprises Limited (R.E.L.) confronted Howe on a golf course, the minister stated, [...] "R.E.L. was a war-time plant. The war is through, the plant is through, and your union... what happens to your union is up to you. Get the hell off of the course." [...] In disposing of redundant government property, Howe found that saddles and harnesses had been stored {{since the end of}} the Boer War and men had been employed to safeguard and polish them for over 40 years. He strove to eliminate such anachronisms. [...] However, Howe was slower to release economic controls. According to Roberts, [...] "although he worked to return the country's economic power to private hands, he <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> as loath to surrender his own dictatorial powers over it as he was to submit to Parliament". [...] In November 1945, Howe's wartime portfolio was merged into his new responsibility to form the Department of Reconstruction and Supply.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the book}} , on the weekend before John McCain made his vice-presidential pick, McCain's advisor Arthur Culvahouse asked Ted Frank to prepare a written report on Sarah Palin, [...] "Thrown {{together}} from scratch in less than forty hours, the document highlighted her vulnerabilities: [...] "Democrats upset at McCain's anti-Obama 'celebrity' advertisements will mock Palin as an inexperienced beauty queen whose main national exposure was a photo-spread in Vogue in February 2008. Even in campaigning for governor, she {{made a number of}} gaffes, and the Anchorage Daily News expressed concern that she <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> 'unprepared or over her head' in a campaign run by a friend." [...] " [...] The book also says that Frank worked on the vetting of Senator Joe Lieberman. The report was widely criticized; GQ has cited the report as [...] "the most infamous document in veep-vetting history." [...] In Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's book Race of a Lifetime: How Obama Won the White House (2011), they describe the vetting at length. Frank has defended the report as [...] "exhaustive" [...] and covering [...] "almost everything that would eventually dog her on the campaign trail."

Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal".

[...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge <b>often</b> <b>seemed</b> uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing.
