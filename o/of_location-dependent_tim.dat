Mobile database applications through wireless equipment e. g., PDAs, laptops, cell phones and etc. are growing rapidly. Respect to the limitations in mobile environments, it is strongly recommended to minimize number of connections and volume of data transmission from the servers. Caching data item at the client side is a solution. Moreover, the provision <b>of</b> <b>location-dependent</b> information for the same user at different locations is a challenging problem. In this paper, the performance issues <b>of</b> <b>location—dependent</b> queries is addressed, especially nearest-neighbour search. The system investigates a common scenario where data objects (e. g., restaurants and gas stations) are stationary while users / clients that issue queries about the data objects are mobile. The gridpartition index is used to answer nearest-neighbour queries directly whereas the area within which the answer is valid can be computed. Moreover, a caching scheme (hybrid and semantic caching) is proposed to record a cache item {{as well as its}} valid range...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} location-based {{services}} has motivated an important research {{effort in the}} efficient processing <b>of</b> <b>location-dependent</b> queries. Most <b>of</b> the existing approaches only deal with locations at maximum precision (e. g., GPS coordinates). However, due to imprecision or expressivity requirements, there are situations in which locations must be handled at different granularity levels (e. g., neighborhoods, cities, states, etc.). Indeed, whenever a set of locations are represented together as a granule, a meaning is implicitly given to the set. So, the use of different granularities brings different semantics to the location data. In this paper, we propose the use of semantic location granules to enhance the expressivity <b>of</b> <b>location-dependent</b> queries. This is done by exploiting the semantic information that is asserted about different granularity levels. This information could be, for example, the cost incurred by a moving object to traverse a spatial area or a requirement to traverse a connection (e. g., need of a visa or passport). In particular, we propose: 1) an ontological model for describing the semantics inherent to location granules; 2) an upper-level ontology that can be extended and adapted to different scenarios; and 3) {{the use of a}} reasoner to exploit the semantics expressed in the ontologies, to make it possible to add new query constraints and so extend the expressivity of the queries. ...|$|R

In anisotropic networks, the Euclidean distance between a pair of nodes may not correlate closely with the hop count between them because the corresponding shortest path may have to curve around intermediate holes, resulting in poor distance estimation. And {{without the help of}} a large number of uniformly deployed seed nodes, those schemes fail in anisotropic WSNs. To address this issue and improve the accuracy of localization, we propose the Removing Heavily Curved Path (RHCP) scheme in this paper. RHCP takes advantage of selecting the paths which are not heavily affected by the holes to recalculate the location of each unknown node. Through simulation, the results reveal that RHCP performs better than original DV-Hop in anisotropic networks with different shape of holes. In addition, through iterations of RHCP, the results get improved for different anchor node densities...|$|R
