5000|$|The Capricorn Coast {{was part}} of the {{traditional}} lands of the Darumbal Aboriginal people. Yeppoon was first settled by the Ross family in 1865 who took up large landholding {{along the length of the}} Capricorn Coast. Fruit crops, cattle, and wool were the major industries of the early town. A short-lived period of sugar cane growing followed from 1883 to 1903, which failed due to unseasonal rains and lack of financial backing. Along with other sugar growing areas of Australia, South Sea Islanders were used as labourers on the sugar plantations, often without their consent (see blackbirding). Pineapples, mangoes, and <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> became the mainstay of local agriculture in the new century, with cattle grazing and fishing also contributing to the local economy.|$|E
5000|$|The name Bingil is {{believed}} to be an Aboriginal word meaning a good camping ground given to the area by Frederick Cutten, a pioneer settler in the area. In 1884, the Cutten brothers (Frederick, Leonard, Sydney and James) established the first commercial tea plantation in Australia on their Bicton estate at Bingil Bay, also growing coffee, mangoes, bananas, pineapples and <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit.</b> At that time, Bingil Bay was only accessible by boat. Most of the Bicton estate was destroyed by a cyclone in 1918 and although the homestead was rebuilt the remainder of the estate was never restored. The descendants of the original tea plants were rediscovered in the rain-forest by Dr Alan Maruff in 1958 and seedlings from these plants formed the basis for the Nerada tea plantations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Carissa spinarum L., is a {{tropical}} underutilized fruit abundantly available during summer season, which is delicious {{to taste with}} an astringency flavor and fruity aroma. Hence, the present investigation was aimed at optimizing fermentation conditions {{for the production of}} wine and to assess its physiochemical composition and antioxidant activity. Response surface methodology coupled with central composite design was employed for the optimization studies. It was determined that fermentation temperature of 25 °C, pH of 3. 5 and inoculum size of 10 % (v/v) resulted in quality wine with 8. 3 % (v/v) of ethanol content. Further, physicochemical composition and antioxidant activity of the optimized wine was found to be significantly higher or on par with <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> wines reported previously. Sensory analysis indicated that wine was good in terms of overall acceptability. Thus, availability of C. spinarum fruits during their glut season can be utilized for winemaking and could generate revenue among rural households further adding significant input to the economy of fruit wine market...|$|E
30|$|The mixed {{fruit wines}} (pawpaw and {{watermelon}} wine, pawpaw and banana wine, pawpaw, banana and watermelon wine and banana and watermelon wine) {{produced in the}} present investigation revealed low pH values (in the range of 2.5 – 3.8) throughout the fermentation periods and in the final product. Similar observations have been reported for <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> wines such as tundu wine (Sahu et al. 2012), sweet potato wine (Ray et al. 2011), sapota fruit wine (Panda et al. 2014 a, b) and banana wine (Obaedo and Ikenebomeh 2009). Studies have shown that during fermentation of fruit, low pH is inhibitory to spoilage organisms but increases conducive environment {{for the growth of}} desirable organisms. Also, low pH is known to give fermenting yeasts a competitive advantage in natural environment (Reddy and Reddy 2005; Chilaka et al. 2010). The decrease in pH could be due to accumulation of organic acids during fermentation and this reduces the influence of bacteria that can lead to spoilage. Therefore the wines have a good keeping quality.|$|E
40|$|Papaya (Carica papaya) {{has been}} used in our {{laboratory}} with a range of technologies for ex situ conservation of germplasm. It represents a good model species, as it {{has been the subject of}} major research efforts in tissue culture and biotechnology. We have investigated seed storage behaviour via desiccation curves based on accurate water activity measurements and a range of storage environments from liquid nitrogen to 15 ï 15 % RH. Treatments have been optimised to break dormancy and to ensure germination after seed storage. Twenty years of accumulated experience in papaya cell and tissue culture has facilitated our investigation of cryopreservation protocols, including vitrification based techniques, encapsulation and slow freezing, on a range of in vitro tissues from shoot tips to somatic embryos. This research has led to the development of optimum protocols for ex situ conservation of papaya germplasm, both as seed and vegetative tissue which have application to <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> species. Plants that were recovered post-cryopreservation have been screened for changes in genomic DNA and DNA methylation using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based Randomly Amplified DNA Fingerprinting (RAF) and Amplified DNA Methylation Polymorphism (AMP) techniques, and are being evaluated in field plantings. Similarly, work on embryo culture techniques in our lab have contributed to the success of intergeneric breeding programs. Efficient molecular markers have been employed to assess genetic diversity within and between papaya genotypes and related Vasconcella species. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{paramount}} importance of pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) in world production and trade of tropical fruits, the genomics of this crop is still lagging behind that of <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> {{crops such as}} banana or papaya. A genetic map of pineapple was constructed using an F 2 segregating population obtained from a single selfed F 1 plant of a cross A. comosus var. comosus (cv. Rondon, clone BR 50) × A. comosus var. bracteatus (Branco do mato, clone BR 20). Multiple randomly amplified markers (RAPD, ISSR and AFLP) were brought together with SSR and EST-SSR markers identified among sequences uploaded to public databases and with sequence-specific markers (SCAR, SSR and CAPS) derived from random amplified markers. Sixty-three randomly amplified markers (RAPD, ISSR and AFLP) were selected and cloned, resulting in 71 sequences which were used to generate sequence-specific SCAR and CAPS markers. The present map includes 492 DNA markers: 57 RAPD, 22 ISSR, 348 AFLP, 20 SSR, 12 EST-SSR, 25 SCARs, 8 CAPS, and the morphological trait locus "piping", gathered into 33 linkage groups that integrate markers inherited from both botanical varieties, four linkage groups with markers only from var. comosus and three linkage groups with markers exclusively from var. bracteatus. The relatively higher mapping efficiency of sequence-specific markers derived from randomly amplified markers (50. 7 %) versus SSR (31. 4 %) and EST-SSR (28. 9 %) markers is discussed. Spanning over 80 % of the 2, 470 cM estimated average length of the genome, the present map constitutes a useful research tool for molecular breeding and genomics projects in pineapple and other Bromeliaceae species.

40|$|The {{production}} of bananas and <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> crops in the subtropics is highly influenced by climate. In {{the case of}} bananas, climate causes undesirable physiological phenomena and long cropping cycles, despite which yields obtained in the subtropics can be excellent. True tropical fruits like rambutan, mangosteen or durian, highly demanding both in temperature and humidity requirements, cannot be economically cultivated in the subtropics, but others like mango, litchi or avocado, have become important commercial crops in many subtropical countries through many years of research and grower efforts. Many other tropical fruits may perform well in the subtropics, but considerable research and development must still be conducted before they can become important commercial crops. Management of pests is generally easier and cheaper compared with the tropics due to the constraints of low temperatures and humidity on pathogen activity. This has important relevance for organic cultivation, which can add value to the {{production of}} tropical fruits in the subtropics. Since tropical trees produce fewer annual flushes per year in subtropical climates, tree growth control is easier and suitable pruning techniques allow their cultivation at high density, facilitating high initial yields with optimal management. Proximity to the market is an additional advantage, not only for cost reasons, but also due to a reduced carbon footprint. Special problems and challenges for tropical fruit cultivation in the subtropics include the growing importance of Fusarium wilt and weevil borer on banana in cooler climates, and the impact of low temperatures in relation to flowering, pollination, fruit set, fruit quality and yield in many tropical tree crops. The actual importance of and future prospects for, developing banana and other relevant tropical fruits in the subtropics, is analysed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Belonging to the Annonaceae family, marolo (Annona coriaceae) is {{a native}} species of the Brazilian "cerrado" región (Minas Gerais, Goiás and Distrito Federal) {{and can be found}} in South American {{tropical}} zones. Its fruits are highly consumed by local people and commercialized in markets or street stalls. There is, however, a tendency for the extinction of marolo due to deforestation and the large scale plantation of monocultures instead of native plants. The literature still offers no data on the chemical composition of the proximate composition and vitamin C, A and tannin contents were carried out on the yellow marolo pulp as well as the determination of the physico-chemical characteristics of the seed oil. Five batches of fruit from the Alfenas region [...] south of Minas Gerais State [...] were analysed in this work and their average composition were: humidity 77 %, total sugar 15 %, reducing sugar 11 %, crude protein 1 %, lipids 3 %, fiber 5 % and fixed mineral residue 1 %. The contents of vitamin C and A were 8. 2 mg/ 100 g and 117. 5 RE/ 100 g, respectively, and the tannin content was 245 mg/ 100 g. The results showed high fiber and lipid contents of marolo pulp in comparison with many <b>other</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>fruit</b> pulps. The vitamin C contents were equivalent to those found in avocado, pineapple and watermelon, while the vitamin A contents were equivalent to papaya, peach, guava and several other tropical fruits. Marolo seed contains 45 % of oil on a dry basis. Its composition and physico-chemical characteristics showed the possibility of producing a good quality oil, with great potential for the fine oil market. However the presence of alkaloids in the oil needs to be further studied. Their elimination could be done by refining or extraction in a continuous press. The results exalt the high quality of marolo pulp, showing that the preservation of native species should be stimulated...|$|E
