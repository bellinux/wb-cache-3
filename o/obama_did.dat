5|$|The United States' {{occupation}} of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American {{troops from the}} Dominican Republic in 1924. Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the Sixth International Conference of American States, January 15–17, 1928, in Havana, Cuba. This was the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency. There, he extended an olive branch to Latin American leaders embittered over America's interventionist policies in Central America and the Caribbean. For 88 years {{he was the only}} sitting president to have visited Cuba, until Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> so in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

[...] According to The New York Times, [...] "several of the book's accusations, in fact, are unsubstantiated, misleading or inaccurate." [...] Peter Wehner of Commentary wrote: [...] "conservatives should not hitch their hopes to" [...] Corsi's book because [...] "it seems to be riddled with factual errors [...] some relatively minor (like asserting that <b>Obama</b> <b>does</b> not mention the birth of his half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, in Dreams from My Father; <b>Obama</b> <b>does</b> mention her), and some significant (suggesting that Obama favors withdrawing troops from Afghanistan; he wants to do the opposite)." ...|$|R

25|$|Reaction to Obama's {{speech was}} swift and {{widespread}} in the United States.

The U.S. funds 20% of Egypt's military costs (US$1.3 billion) and gives another US$250 million in economic aid.

25|$|During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hillary Clinton ran to {{the left}} of Barack Obama on {{economic}} issues. On the issue of health care, Clinton was willing to include an individual mandate to buy health insurance as part of a program for universal coverage. Obama was not willing to go so far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position. Clinton secured more labor union backing than Obama, and <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> better than Clinton at gaining primary votes from self-identified independents. However, on foreign policy issues, Hillary Clinton was more hawkish than Barack Obama. However, Hillary has opposed certain liberal aspects of Obamacare such as the cadillac tax.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{lost his}} home state of Massachusetts, {{becoming}} the first major party presidential candidate to lose {{his home state}} since Democrat Al Gore lost {{his home state of}} Tennessee to Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 election. Romney lost his home state by more than 23%, the worst losing margin for a major party candidate since John Frémont in 1856. Even worse than Frémont, Romney failed to win a single county in his home state. In addition, since Obama carried Ryan's home state of Wisconsin, the Romney–Ryan ticket was the first major party ticket since the 1972 election to have both of its nominees lose their home states. Romney won the popular vote in every county of three states: Utah, Oklahoma, and West Virginia; <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> so in four states: Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 2011, Obama {{announced}} that he would seek re-election in the 2012 presidential election. <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not face any significant rivals for the 2012 Democratic nomination. Obama's Republican opponent in the general election, former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, advocated for lower taxes, spending cuts, an increase in defense spending, and a repeal of Obamacare (which was ironically based on a Massachusetts healthcare plan developed under Romney). Obama's campaign was based in Chicago and run by many former members of the White House staff and members of the successful 2008 campaign. Obama won re-election with 332 (out of a total of 538) electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote, making him the first person since Dwight Eisenhower to twice win 51 percent of the vote. According to exit polls, Obama won a majority of the vote from women, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, people under 45, people making less than $50,000 per year, people inhabiting large or mid-sized cities, liberals, moderates, the unmarried, gays, and people with no college education, some college education, or graduate degrees. In addition to the presidential election victory, the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of Congress, but Republicans retained control of the House.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the election, {{commentators}} discussed whether Senator Obama {{would be}} able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia in the South (region as defined by the US Census Bureau). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades. Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since 1956 (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960. He was the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836 and the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning West Virginia since 1916. Because one West Virginia elector voted for the Democrat in 1916, Obama was the first Democrat to win without any electors from the state since its founding in 1863. Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee {{for the first time since}} 1964. Although <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana (which were won by Bill Clinton in 1992), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.|$|E
500|$|On January 4, 2012, a White House {{communications}} director announced in a tweet that President Obama would be giving Cordray a recess {{appointment to the}} post, bypassing the Senate. The move was criticized by Republican senators, who argued that Congress had not officially been in recess, and that <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not {{have the authority to}} bypass Congressional approval. Writing for The New Republic, Timothy Noah, a supporter of Cordray, wrote, [...] "As someone who strongly supported a recess appointment for Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I'm confused as to why President Obama chose to act today. ...

500|$|Although Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, {{indicated}} {{at first}} that President <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not plan to retake the oath, Chief Justice Roberts agreed to re-administer the oath {{at the request of}} White House counsel Greg Craig. The second oath ceremony took place on the evening of January 21, 2009 in the Map Room of the White House before a small audience of presidential aides, reporters and a White House photographer. Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re-administer the oath out of an abundance of caution. Craig added that [...] "the oath of office was administered effectively and... the President was sworn in appropriately... But the oath appears in the Constitution itself." [...] No Bible was present during the retake of the inauguration.|$|E

Federal authorities told the Associated Press they did not believe Schlesselman and Cowart had the means to carry out their threat. Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not have any campaign appearances planned for Tennessee. One federal law enforcement official told the AP that [...] plans did not include Obama's schedule or a specific time and place for the assassination because, [...] "I don't think they had that level of detail." [...] Authorities said they made several mistakes during their planning, including drawing too much attention to themselves with their car markings. Authorities also felt their inability to carry out a home robbery together indicated they would be unable to carry out a sophisticated assassination plot.

500|$|To become law, {{the bill}} {{will need to be}} {{included}} in a final version of tax legislation from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the President. [...] In 2005, President Bush established an advisory panel on tax reform that examined several national sales tax variants including aspects of the FairTax and noted several concerns. These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report. [...] The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the 2008 presidential election on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill. A poll in 2009 by Rasmussen Reports found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds. [...] President Barack <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not support the bill, arguing for more progressive changes to the income and payroll tax systems. [...] President Donald Trump has proposed to lower overall income taxation and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.|$|E
500|$|Specter {{received}} several high-profile endorsements {{during the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} the primary. Senator John Kerry, who had been an early supporter of Sestak's 2006 House campaign, endorsed Specter in the Senate race, calling him [...] "fighter and a friend, and I am proud to vouch for his character". The Philadelphia Inquirer called Sestak [...] "a worthy opponent" [...] and said that his determination made the race especially competitive, but ultimately embraced Specter, whose overall career record the newspaper said was [...] "a good choice for Democrats". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Specter, focusing more on the fact that Specter stood the best chance of defeating Toomey in a general election challenge. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, however, endorsed Sestak, calling him [...] "incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and articular" [...] while condemning Specter as a [...] "self-serving political ferret" [...] for switching parties. Actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared in a television advertisement for Specter, praising the Senator for his long-standing support of stem cell research. Fox said, [...] "In the fight against disease, you can look back or move forward. Arlen Specter is moving forward." [...] President Obama sent e-mail messages to his Organizing for America supporters encouraging them to vote for Specter, However, despite his long position of support for Specter, <b>Obama</b> <b>did</b> not fly to Pennsylvania to actively campaign for the Senator during the campaign's final days.|$|E
500|$|Other popular ideas {{included}} legalizing online poker in the United States, {{and focusing}} on green initiatives. One post suggested the administration investigate UFOs, and another suggested Obama hire entertainment personalities including Michael Moore, Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and Stephen Colbert. After voting had closed, the most popular suggestion with 92,000 votes was [...] "Ending marijuana prohibition", and the third most popular: [...] "Stop using federal resources to undermine states' medicinal marijuana laws." [...] A representative for President Obama, Jen Psaki, told Reuters: [...] "President <b>Obama</b> <b>does</b> not support the legalization of marijuana." ...|$|R
