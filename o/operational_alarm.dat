40|$|The massive {{amount of}} alarm data {{generated}} from intrusion detection systems is cumbersome for network system administrators to analyze. Often, important details are overlooked {{and it is difficult}} to get an overall picture of what is occurring in the network by manually traversing textual alarm logs. We have designed a novel visualization to address this problem by showing alarm activity within a network. Alarm data is presented in an overview where system administrators can get a general sense of network activity and easily detect anomalies. They then have the option of zooming and drilling down for details. The information is presented with local network IP (Internet Protocol) addresses plotted over multiple yaxes to represent the location of alarms. Time on the x-axis is used to show the pattern of the alarms and variations in color encode the severity and amount of alarms. Based on our system administrator requirements study, this graphical layout addresses what system administrators need to see, is faster and easier than analyzing text logs, and uses visualization techniques to effectively scale and display the data. With this design, we have built a tool that effectively uses <b>operational</b> <b>alarm</b> log data generated on the Georgia Tech campus network.

40|$|Achieving a {{high degree}} of {{dependability}} in complex macro-systems is challenging. Because of the large number of components and numerous independent teams involved, an overview of the global system performance is usually lacking to support both design and operation adequately. A functional failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) approach is proposed to address the dependability optimisation of large and complex systems. The basic inductive model FMECA has been enriched to include considerations such as <b>operational</b> procedures, <b>alarm</b> systems. environmental and human factors, as well as operation in degraded mode. Its implementation on a commercial software tool allows an active linking between the functional layers of the system and facilitates data processing and retrieval, which enables to contribute actively to the system optimisation. The proposed methodology has been applied to optimise dependability in a railway signalling system. Signalling systems are typical example of large complex systems made of multiple hierarchical layers. The proposed approach appears appropriate to assess the global risk- and availability-level of the system as well as to identify its vulnerabilities. This enriched-FMECA approach enables to overcome some of the limitations and pitfalls previously reported with classical FMECA approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{discrimination}} of {{the clutter}} interfering signal is a current problem in modern radars’ design, especially in coastal or offshore environments where the histogram {{of the background}} signal often displays heavy tails. The statistical characterization of this signal {{is very important for}} the cancellation of sea clutter, whose behavior obeys a K distribution according to the commonly accepted criterion. By using neural networks, the authors propose a new method for estimating the K shape parameter, demonstrating its superiority over the classic alternative based on the Method of Moments. Whereas both solutions have a similar performance when the entire range of possible values of the shape parameter is evaluated, the neuronal alternative achieves a much more accurate estimation for the lower Fig. s of the parameter. This is exactly the desired behavior because the best estimate occurs for the most aggressive states of sea clutter. The final design, reached by processing three different sets of computer generated K samples, used a total of nine neural networks whose contribution is synthesized in the final estimate, thus the solution can be interpreted as a deep learning approximation. The results are to be applied in the improvement of radar detectors, particularly for maintaining the <b>operational</b> false <b>alarm</b> probability close to the one conceived in the design...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{environment}} {{is complex and}} safety-critical. Whilst exchanging information with pilots, controllers must also be alert to visual notifications displayed {{on the radar screen}} (e. g. warning which indicates a loss of minimum separation between aircraft). Under the assumption that attentional resources are shared between vision and hearing, the visual interface design may also impact the ability to process these auditory stimuli. Using a simulated ATC task, we compared the behavioral and neural responses to two different visual notification designs - the <b>operational</b> <b>alarm</b> that involves blinking colored “ALRT” displayed around the label of the notified plane (“Color-Blink”), and the more salient alarm involving the same blinking text plus four moving yellow chevrons (“Box-Animation”). Participants performed a concurrent auditory task with the requirement to react to rare pitch tones. P 300 from the occurrence of the tones was taken as an indicator of remaining attentional resources. Participants who were presented with the more salient visual design showed better accuracy than the group with the suboptimal operational design. On a physiological level, auditory P 300 amplitude in the former group was greater than that observed in the latter group. One potential explanation is that the enhanced visual design freed up attentional resources which, in turn, improved the cerebral processing of the auditory stimuli. These results suggest that P 300 amplitude {{can be used as a}} valid estimation of the efficiency of interface designs, and of cognitive load more generally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There is {{diversity}} {{in the use of}} global goodness-of-fit statistics to determine how well models forecast flood hydrographs. This paper compares the results from nine evaluation measures and two forecasting models. The evaluation measures comprise global goodness-of-fit measures as recommended by Legates and McCabe (1999) and Smith (2000) and more flood specific measures which gauge the ability of the models to predict <b>operational</b> <b>alarm</b> levels and the rising limb of the hydrograph. The models used in this particular study are artificial neural networks trained with backpropagation (BPNNs) and a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN). Networks were trained to forecast stage on the River Tyne, Northumbria, for lead times ranging from 2 to 6 hours with minimal data. The training data set consisted of continuous data for one winter period and validation was undertaken using data from winter periods for three other years. The results showed that the TDNNs performed better than the BPNNs although the evaluation measures indicate that the performance of these particular models for operational purposes is not yet sufficient. Issues regarding the creation of appropriate training data sets and sampling procedures as well as the hydrological conditions of the River Tyne need to be investigated further. A consistent set of operational evaluation measures and benchmark data sets must be established before comparison of neural network and physical models can be facilitated. The combination of evaluation measures provides a good picture of the overall forecasting performance of the models, and suggests that operators should consider a range of measures. 1...|$|E
40|$|As {{the trend}} of {{successful}} network attacks continue to rise, better forms of intrusion, detection and prevention are needed. This thesis addresses network traffic visualization techniques that aid administrators in recognizing attacks. A view of port statistics and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts has been developed. Each help to address issues with analyzing large datasets involving networks. Due {{to the amount of}} traffic as well as the range of possible port numbers and IP addresses, scaling techniques are necessary. A port-based overview of network activity produces an improved representation for detecting and responding to malicious activity. We have found that presenting an overview using stacked histograms of aggregate port activity, combined with the ability to drill-down for finer details allows small, yet important details to be noticed and investigated without being obscured by large, usual traffic. Another problem administrators face is the cumbersome amount of alarm data generated from IDS sensors. As a result, important details are often overlooked, {{and it is difficult to}} get an overall picture of what is occurring in the network by manually traversing textual alarm logs. We have designed a novel visualization to address this problem by showing alarm activity within a network. Alarm data is presented in an overview from which system administrators can get a general sense of network activity and easily detect anomalies. They additionally have the option of then zooming and drilling down for details. Based on our system administrator requirements study, this graphical layout addresses what system administrators need to see, is faster and easier than analyzing text logs, and uses visualization techniques to effectively scale and display the data. With this design, we have built a tool that effectively uses <b>operational</b> <b>alarm</b> log data generated on the Georgia Tech campus network. For both of these systems, we describe the input data, the system design, and examples. Finally, we summarize potential future work. Ph. D.

40|$|Nowaday, in domains with {{a uniform}} {{hierarchical}} structure, like Power System networks domain, {{the advantages of}} the introduction of knowledge based systems to automate information processing are well known. In the specific case of alarm processing, the majority of studies have been focused on alarms in central energy management systems, in which only one system is required. The still unsolved problem appears when trying to automate a task at all local nodes (in our case, at substation level), i. e., when a distributed solution must be find. To go one step further, the solution method must be capable of the automatic generation of similar expert systems, taking into account not only conceptual similarities, but also physical differences, different topologies and different tasks. With the purpose to identify the REUSABLE POINTS of an intelligent substation alarm processor, in order to be modified and reconfigured to correspond to any particular real substation, a prototypical hybrid rule-based object-oriented expert system for the treatment of alarm messages in power substation plants has been developed. This work would lead to state the necessary features of a Distributed Network of intelligent substation alarm processors, installed at each substation of a Power System network.

40|$|There {{is a big}} {{semantic}} “gap ” between {{textual information}} spread into the many documents (space system manuals, etc.) used in operations and what is really produced (software, hardware, procedures, spacecraft database, etc.) and used for validation (simulators, test beds, failure analysis tools, etc.). Operational user is “taken between ” {{a huge amount of}} documentation and the very low level information spread into many different specialized formalisms and tools. It is very difficult to get quickly the information necessary to understand how the system works, which is a key point for many operation tasks like the design of <b>operational</b> procedures, <b>alarm</b> or error analysis, etc. A formalized model that captures the system knowledge would not only help designers and operators to catch it much more efficiently rather than in documents, but this may also be used by the computer to ease the many verification and validation tasks to be done, and may enable to keep a more efficient traceability with requirements during the whole system life-cycle. Some attempts to go towards this formalized, global and centralized system view have already been made, for instance with the “Space System Model ” from the European ECSS-E-ST- 70 - 31 standard. However, it needs to be much more enriched to take into account all the different views of the system and obtain all the expected benefits. In this paper, we present the results of a CNES R&T study called EGPO done with the help of ATOS Company to go further in this direction, initiating a richer view of the space system, and formalizing it with a customization of the SysML standard to the space domain.

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to co-channel speech processing {{has been to}} either enhance the target speech, or suppress the interferer’s speech, or perform both simultaneously.

Primary repository operations consist of both surface and subsurface activities relating to high-level waste receipt, preparation, and emplacement. Secondary repository operations consist of support operations for waste handling and treatment, utilities, subsurface construction, and other selected ancillary activities. Remote control of the subsurface emplacement operations, as well as, repository performance confirmation operations are the direct responsibility of the system. In addition, the system monitors parameters such as radiological data, air quality data, fire detection status, meteorological conditions, unauthorized access, and abnormal operating conditions, to ensure a safe workplace for personnel. Parameters are displayed in a real-time manner to human operators regarding surface and subsurface conditions. The system performs supervisory monitoring and control for both important to safety and non-safety systems. The system provides repository <b>operational</b> information, <b>alarm</b> capability, and human operator response messages during emergency response situations. The system also includes logic control to place equipment, systems, and utilities in a safe operational mode or complete shutdown during emergency response situations. The system initiates <b>alarms</b> and provides <b>operational</b> data to enable appropriate actions {{at the local level}} in support of emergency response, radiological protection response, evacuation, and underground rescue. The system provides data communications, data processing, managerial reports, data storage, and data analysis. This system's primary surface and subsurface operator consoles, for both supervisory and remote control activities, will be located in a Central Control Center (CCC) inside one of the surface facility buildings.

40|$|Collisions between FPSO and shuttle tanker {{in tandem}} {{offloading}} operation {{have caused a}} growing concern in the North Sea. Several recent contact incidents between FPSO/FSU and shuttle tanker have clearly demonstrated a high likelihood of contact between vessels in tandem offloading. The large masses involved, i. e. the high potential impact energy, make the collision risk large. Traditional ship/platform collision frequency modeling may not be applicable in the tandem offloading context. Moreover, offshore quantitative risk analyses generally focus more on technical aspects, little on human and organizational aspects. This leads to a hardware-dominated risk reduction approach, {{and it has been}} proved not to be effective to mitigate risks involved in complex marine operations in general. Frequency modeling of collision between FPSO and shuttle tanker in offloading operation is carried out in this study. The collision frequency model is structured in two stages, i. e. the initiating stage and the recovery stage, where the former involves an uncontrolled forward movement of tanker, and the latter involves the recovery actions initiated from tanker and FPSO to avoid the collision. In the initiating stage, this study focuses on tanker drive-off forward scenarios. Macroscopically, the frequency of tanker drive-off ahead during offshore loading and specifically during tandem offloading is portrayed by statistical data from an earlier study, recent SYNERGI incident data, and expert judgments made by tanker DP operators. Relatively high frequency values of tanker drive-off in tandem offloading are found. Microscopically, the tanker drive-off ahead scenario is investigated by examining 9 such events in tandem offloading based on investigation reports, interviews and discussions with individuals who directly or indirectly were involved. Findings reveal that in order to effectively reduce tanker drive-off in tandem offloading, efforts should be targeted on minimizing those failure prone situations, i. e. the excessive relative motions (termed as surging and yawing) between FPSO and tanker. A simulation-based study is carried out to quantitatively assess and effectively minimize the occurrence of excessive surging and yawing events. Horizontal motions of FPSO and tanker in tandem configuration are simulated via a state-of-the-art time-domain simulation code SIMO. Findings demonstrate that excessive surging and yawing events can be effectively minimized via measures such as minimizing FPSO surge and yaw motions in offloading, coordinating mean heading between FPSO and tanker, and using the dedicated DP software with the tandem loading function on tanker. Ultimately, these measures may provide a sound operational environment where the possibility of tanker drive-off can be minimized. In the recovery stage, this study is focused on the recovery action initiated by the tanker DP operator. Possible recovery actions are identified and evaluated. Based on calibrated tanker motion simulations, the allowable time for DP operator to initiate recovery action, so that tanker can be stopped within a separation distance, e. g. 80 m to FPSO, is found to be critically short. A 3 -stage information-decision-execution model is generalized to model the DP operator’s information processing stages regarding action initiation when in a drive-off scenario. Based on this human information-processing model, expert judgment by simulator trainer and questionnaire survey among shuttle tanker captains and DP officers are conducted, reasonable estimates of the time needed for action initiation are obtained. The estimates are found to be convergent to the facts in the incidents. Findings suggest that tanker DP operators in general need more time to initiate recovery action than the allowable time window, i. e. recovery failure is likely due to lack of reaction time. Two principal recommendations are proposed to reduce the recovery failure probability, i. e. to provide a longer time window for the operator to initiate recovery action, and/or to provide various kinds of assistance to the operator to reduce the recovery action initiation time. To increase the time window, a promising measure is to substantially increase the separation distance between FPSO and tanker, e. g. from 80 m to 150 m. The feasibility of this measure is discussed from a number of perspectives. Recovery improvement gains are assessed. The key question concerning implementation is to know how much separation distance should be configured in the operation. This has to be based on considerations of both human operators’ need for reaction time, and tanker drive-off behavior. Parametric tanker drive-off motion simulations are carried out in which human action at various times are imposed. The necessary distance values to stop the tanker are then obtained, and ideally these should correspond to the separation distance values between FPSO and tanker in tandem offloading. These findings provide decision-making support to select an optimum field configuration for FPSO-tanker tandem offloading, which may inherently minimize the collision risk. Effective reduction of reaction time can be achieved by early detection and/or quick decision-making. This is based on the operator information-processing model generalized earlier in this study. Measures to improve early detection are identified. Discussions are guided by the human signal detection theory, and supported by the <b>operational</b> facts of <b>alarm</b> and non-alarm signals in the operation. Measures to effectively reduce the operator’s time involved in diagnosis and situation awareness are also identified. They are theoretically built on the generic human decision-making theory, and specifically designed for drive-off intervention based on the facts collected via a questionnaire survey among shuttle tanker captains and DP officers. These findings illuminate a broad area in the human factor perspective, i. e. training, procedure, crew resource management, human-machine interface, and automation support, where measures to reduce operator reaction time should be targeted. These measures may directly reduce the FPSO-tanker collision risk in tandem offloading. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
