The piston charger charges the main {{cylinder}} and simultaneously regulates the inlet and the <b>outlet</b> <b>aperture,</b> leading to {{no loss of}} air and fuel in the exhaust. In the main cylinder, combustion takes place every turn as in a two-stroke engine and lubrication as in a four-stroke. Fuel injection can {{take place in the}} piston charger, in the gas-transfer channel or in the combustion chamber. It is also possible to charge two working cylinders with one piston charger. The combination of compact design for the combustion chamber together with no loss of air and fuel is claimed to give the engine more torque, more power and better fuel consumption. The benefit of fewer moving parts and design is claimed to lead to lower manufacturing costs. Good for hybrid technology and stationary engines. The engine is claimed to be suited to alternative, fuels since there is no corrosion or deposits left on valves.The six strokes are: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{two-dimensional}} turbulence k-ε {{model is}} used to predict the distribution of air velocity, temperature and turbulence kinetic energy in a ventilated room using different positions of inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>apertures.</b> The Navier Stockes, energy and turbulence equations are solved using finite volume techniques with staggered grid. The characteristics of air flow are analyzed under different parameters such as inlet and outlet positions, aspect ratio and air supply velocities. This study {{is focused on the}} prediction of turbulent recirculating flows in large indoor spaces. The results show that the wall jet region and recirculation regions are affected by the position of inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>apertures.</b> Also the results indicate that recirculation regions are increased with increasing Reynolds number and decrease with decreasing aspect ratio.

40|$|The morphoanatomy, {{cellular}} organization, {{and surface}} {{architecture of the}} olfactory apparatus in Cirrhinus reba (Hamilton) is described using light and scanning electron microscopy. The oval shaped olfactory rosette contained 32 ± 2 primary lamellae {{on each side of}} the median raphe, and was lodged on the floor of the olfactory chamber. The olfactory lamellae were basically flat and compactly arranged in the rosette. The olfactory chamber communicated to the outside aquatic environment through inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>apertures</b> with a conspicuous nasal flap in between. The mid dorsal portion of the olfactory lamellae was characterized by a linguiform process. Sensory and non-sensory regions were distributed separately on each lamella. The sensory epithelium occupied the apical part including the linguiform process, whereas the resting part of the lamella was covered with non-sensory epithelium. The sensory epithelium comprised both ciliated and microvillous receptor cells distinguished by the architecture on their apical part. The non-sensory epithelium possessed mucous cells, labyrinth cells, and stratified epithelial cells with distinctive microridges. The functional importance of the different cells lining the olfactory mucosa was correlated with the ecological habits of the fish examined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} {{concept in}} which a single-tank molten salt thermal energy storage arrangement also acts as a volumetric receiver is being developed {{in connection with the}} CSPonD 2 (Concentrated Solar Power on Demand Demonstration) project. The tank is located at the focal point of a beam-down tower to act as both solar energy receiver and thermal energy storage. The relatively small angle subtended by rays emanating from the central reflector of a beam down optical system, together with the nature of solar energy absorption within the volumetric receiver, make use of a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) or CPC-like final optical element attractive. An effective concentration of about 4 can be achieved to increase solar flux at the tank aperture from 150 to 600 suns. This paper describes preliminary designs of the CPC and tank/receiver. Optical simulations reveal that, for a given solar incident power at the tank aperture, a conical final concentrator design produces a more uniform flux distribution with better axial alignment (lower average horizontal component) of rays at its outlet compared to a conventional CPC of revolution. However the cone may require a larger outlet radius, leading to higher thermal losses through the tank aperture. With the current design of the tank, the losses through the walls correspond to 5. 5 % of the thermal capacity. To maximize the tank thermal efficiency, a thorough investigation will be carried out, starting with measurements of the molten salt emissivity, to determine the cone <b>outlet</b> radius/tank <b>aperture</b> and cone height that achieve maximum system efficiency with a 250 - 550 °C molten salt working temperature range...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} prototype H- ion source for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is presented. Experience obtained in the ongoing SNS R&D program is being utilized in the current design. The physics design parameters require a 2 MHz RF-driven multicusp ion source operated at 50 kW, pulsed (6 % duty factor) RF-power. The four major components (plasma-generator, cesium collar, outlet electrode, the source tilt mechanism) of the mechanical packaging of the ion source will be presented in details. The {{mechanical design}} has the unique capability of tilting the ion source in one plane in order to compensate the H- ion beam deflection caused by a strong magnetic field across the <b>outlet</b> <b>aperture.</b> This B- field deflects electrons in the extracted beam back to the outlet electrode. An articulating strut system will provide accurate control over the adjustable tilt angle. This new ion source design will provide easy serviceability of maintenance parts like the RF-antenna and the cesium dispensing system. ...|$|E

40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source * (SNS) {{facility}} employs an RF-driven, Cs-enhanced, multi-cusp H- ion source. To date, {{the source}} {{has been successfully}} utilized in commissioning the SNS accelerator and in early operations of the facility, producing beam currents of 10 - 40 mA with duty-factors of ~ 0. 1 %. In the near future, the ion source {{will be required to}} inject 40 - 60 mA of beam current into the linac with a duty-factor of ~ 7 %. We are therefore investigating methods to simultaneously increase the beam current, duty-factor and reliability of the SNS ion source. Presently, Cs is dispensed within the source using cartridges containing a compressed powder mixture of Cs 2 CrO 4, Al and Zr loaded into a cylindrical collar surrounding the <b>outlet</b> <b>aperture.</b> The source is cesiated by briefly increasing the temperature of the Cs 2 CrO 4. Initially, this process increases the H- beam current significantly but the beam soon decays to a more modest level of enhancement. The degree and duration of H- beam current enhancement can vary considerably between ion sources (not reproducible) and can only be repeated 1 - 3 times in a given source before the Cs is depleted and the source needs to be replaced. This is especially problematic during high duty-factor operation. This report describes the design of an elemental Cs system incorporating an external elemental Cs reservoir (based on the proven Fermilab design), a directly heated Cs transfer line, a Cs injection collar and a temperature-controlled conical ionization surface. The results of the first experiments performed with this system are reported...|$|E
