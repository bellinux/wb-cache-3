5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> approximate the function with {{a finite number}} of terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E
5|$|The treatises cover a {{wide range}} of topics, {{including}} Symeon's defense against Stephen regarding his own views on the unity of the Holy Trinity. He also presents his doctrine on mysticism, the necessity of faith, the possibility of direct experience of God, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and more. The last four treatises were written during his exile, and discuss living a holy life while on earth, salvation through faith and good works, and the need for solitude if <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> become a channel of divine grace to others.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the real worthiness of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound {{the amount of money}} at a given interest rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds the minimum guaranteed rate provided the bank's saving account, for example. If <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> compare their change in purchasing power, then they should use the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate).|$|E

25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle. The {{reason is that the}} theory becomes strongly coupled in this case and perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> get meaningful physical results.|$|E

25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used.

The null hypothesis of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} the thinkings of Rawls {{is that it is}} overly {{procedural}} as found in defenders of natural law. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E
