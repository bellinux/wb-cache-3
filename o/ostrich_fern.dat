50|$|Matteuccia is a genus of ferns {{with one}} species, Matteuccia struthiopteris (common names <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern,</b> fiddlehead fern or {{shuttlecock}} fern). It is a crown-forming, colony-forming plant, occurring in temperate {{regions of the}} Northern Hemisphere in central and northern Europe, northern Asia, and northern North America. The species epithet struthiopteris comes from Ancient Greek words, struthio meaning ostrich and pterion meaning wing.|$|E
50|$|Skärte {{consists}} of two hills, covered with oak forest. Between the hills there is a ravine. In the ravine runs a stream, Stenån, which also passes through the nearby Gässlösa.

The old oak trees in the reserve are covered with lichens.|$|E
50|$|Leptopteris superba, {{commonly}} called Prince of Wales feathers or common crape fern, is a fern in the genus Leptopteris. It {{can be found}} in both New Zealand and Australia. It is characterized by having large fronds (around a meter in length) with large sporangia on their undersides. The shape of the fronds is elliptical (similar to that of <b>Ostrich</b> <b>Fern).</b> It grows from wet lowlands to montane forests.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> is {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} plant in gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. While choosing a place of planting it {{should be taken into}} account that this fern is very expansive and its leaves often lose their beauty throughout the summer, especially if not protected from wind and hail. The tightly wound immature fronds, called fiddleheads, are also used as a cooked vegetable, and are considered a delicacy mainly in rural areas of northeastern North America. It is considered inadvisable to eat uncooked fiddleheads.|$|E
50|$|Dryopteris goldiana, {{commonly}} called Goldie's wood fern, or giant wood fern is a fern {{native to the}} eastern United States and adjacent areas of Canada, from New Brunswick to Ontario and Georgia. It is the largest native North American species of Dryopteris and along with <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> {{it is one of}} the largest ferns in eastern North America. Specimens are known with fronds six feet (1.8 meters) tall. D. goldiana hybridizes with many other species of Dryopteris and the hybrids tend to be larger than the pure species. It was named by William Hooker in honor of its discoverer, John Goldie.|$|E
5000|$|Ferns {{are not as}} {{important}} economically as seed plants but have considerable importance in some societies. Some ferns are used for food, including the fiddleheads of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken), Matteuccia struthiopteris (<b>ostrich</b> <b>fern),</b> and Osmundastrum cinnamomeum (cinnamon fern). Diplazium esculentum is also used by some tropical persons (for example in budu pakis, a traditional dish of Brunei) as food. Tubers from the [...] "para", Ptisana salicina (king fern) are a traditional food in New Zealand and the South Pacific. Fern tubers were used for food 30,000 years ago in Europe. Fern tubers were used by the Guanches to make gofio in the Canary Islands. Ferns are generally not known to be poisonous to humans. Licorice fern rhizomes were chewed by the natives of the Pacific Northwest for their flavor.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{distinctive}} by its pinnae tapering to {{the base}} of the frond, and by its forming extensive clonal colonies on ridgetops and mountain benches. [...] The only other native species in this area with similarly tapering pinnae is the <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern,</b> which generally grows in riparian habitats and is much taller (up to 1.5 m). The only other species that forms as extensive clonal colonies is the hay-scented fern. Unlike the hay-scented fern, New York fern grows along a dark brown, slightly scaly trailing rhizomes, for comparison, hay-scented fern grows along a smooth rhizome with only one frond arising at a node. Hay-scented fern also has leaflets which are much more finely cut or jagged on the edges whereas T. noveboracensis typically has smooth rounded edges to its leaflets.|$|E
50|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the biodiversity of Bartholomew's Cobble. First, the region is so spacially and climatically located that it contains a number of species that reach the northern or southern limit of their range in North America. Second, the property {{is located at the}} boundary of two distinct state bioregions: the marble valley lowlands of The Berkshires geology and the Taconic uplands. Third, the Cobbles, twin rocky knolls abutting the Housatonic River, are composed of quartzite, an acidic rock, and marble, an alkaline (calcareous) rock. This produces high variation in soil chemistry, which in turn supports species of ferns and other plants that do not normally grow in close proximity to one another. Fern species include the walking fern, maidenhair spleenwort, mountain spleenwort, maidenhair fern, bulblet fern, marginal woodfern, polypody, <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern,</b> and evergreen woodfern. Flowering plant species include red columbine, herb Robert, northern prickly ash, bloodroot, spring beauty, bergamot, mayapple, and round-lobed hepatica.|$|E
40|$|Protease {{activities}} were detected in quiescent and germinating spores of the <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> (Matteuccia struthiopteris [L. ] Todaro). Peak endopeptidase, aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase {{activities were}} detected 12 to 24 hours after spores began imbibing under light. There was {{a correlation between}} activities of proteases, the onset of a decline in levels of soluble protein, {{and an increase in}} levels of free amino acids. The earliest visible event of spore germination, breakage of the spore coat and protrusion of a rhizoid cell, was observed after peak protease activity, 48 to 72 hours after the start of imbibition. Results of this study demonstrate similarities in the pattern of protease activities during germination of <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> spores to those of some seeds...|$|E
40|$|Wild {{plants in}} forests provide {{valuable}} living resources for rural communities. The location where local people harvest various species {{is important to}} the wise use of forest ecosystem services. Using global positioning system (GPS) tracking of harvesters’ activities as well as geographic information system (GIS) and a generalized linear model (GLM), this study analyzed the spatial differences among harvesting sites of three popular edible ferns, i. e., <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> (Matteuccia struthiopteris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and royal fern (Osmunda japonica), in mountainous villages of Northeastern Japan. The explanatory variables used were vegetation classes, terrain features, and proximity to roadways. The GLM yielded clear differences in harvesting sites among species that were affected by both the species’ ecological characteristics and human behavior. <b>Ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> was harvested mainly in canopy openings along valley floors, whereas royal fern harvest sites were frequently located in snow avalanche scrublands. Bracken was mainly harvested in deforested areas or young conifer plantations. Whereas <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> and bracken harvest sites were restricted by the accessibility from roadways, {{this was not the case}} for royal fern. Potential harvest sites of ferns were estimated with the highest value for bracken. Our results suggest that local harvesters seriously consider various natural and anthropogenic factors to maintain effective and sustainable harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in growth chambers to {{examine the effect of}} a mild water stress (− 200 kilopascals polyethylene glycol) on frond elongation and water status of the <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> (Matteuccia struthiopteris [L. ] Todaro). Measurements were taken for two days, starting one day after the application of polyethylene glycol. Total water potential in control (well-watered) plants was always significantly higher in immature fronds than in mature fronds. The osmotic potential in mature fronds was always significantly lower (about 800 kilopascals) than in immature fronds in both control and stressed plants. In immature fronds, the stress decreased elongation and total water and pressure potentials, while in mature fronds it increased total water and pressure potentials. The decreases in total and pressure potentials in immature fronds were approximately equal to the increases in mature fronds...|$|E
40|$|Two anthomyiid {{species of}} the genus Chirosia were reared from puparia overwintered in stipe bases of fronds of the <b>Ostrich</b> <b>fern,</b> Matteuccia struthiopteris, in Hokkaido, Japan. One is Chirosia rametoka (Suwa, 1974) {{and the other is}} a species {{described}} here as Chirosia kogomi sp. nov. Both belong to the Chirosia megacephala section proposed by G. C. D. Griffiths in 2004. C. rametoka may be unique in having the head with wide frons and no differentiated orbital setae in both sexes and in having the female 8 th sternite represented by a pair of small sclerites. C. kogomi may be closely related with Chirosia sikisima (Suwa, 1974) and its allied Chirosia major Suwa, 2013 in having the surstyli with a prominent dorsobasal extension and with some stout setae on subapical inner depression, and in having the distiphallus of aedeagus strongly convex dorsally near base of acrophallus...|$|E
40|$|Once {{local expert}} {{knowledge}} regarding the harvesting of various {{non-timber forest products}} (NTFPs) is lost, {{it is difficult to}} recover. We investigated whether the knowledge of expert forest harvesters can be used to determine the habitat distribution and harvesting sites of three popular edible wild ferns, i. e., <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> (Matteuccia struthiopteris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and royal fern (Osmunda japonica), in mountainous communities of western Fukushima, Japan. Using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system (GIS), we found that harvesters were easily able to recognize differences in the spatial characteristics of the habitat distribution of fern species due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. These factors were described by various GIS layers, such as vegetation and terrain features (e. g., gradient, aspect, and slope position) derived from a 20 -m digital elevation model (DEM). Harvesting sites were limited by their distance from a roadway, which differed among species. By comparison with the GPS records of actual harvesting sites, we estimated the potential harvesting sites of each fern species with reasonable accuracy, particularly for bracken. Our results show that the knowledge of expert forest harvesters can be quantified using MCE and GIS, which is useful for determining the spatial characteristics of NTFP harvesting and ensuring sustainable management practices...|$|E
40|$|Two {{globulin}} storage proteins {{have been}} identified in spores of the <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern,</b> Matteuccia struthiopteris (L.) Todaro. The two proteins comprise a significant amount of the total spore protein, are predominantly salt-soluble, and can be extracted by other solvents to a limited extent. The large 11. 3 Svedberg unit (S) globulin is composed of five polypeptides with molecular weights of 21, 000, 22, 000, 24, 000, 28, 000 and 30, 000. Each polypeptide has several isoelectric point (pI) variants between pH 5 and 7. The small 2. 2 S storage protein has a pI > 10. 5 and is composed of at least two major polypeptides of 6, 000 and 14, 000 Mr. The amino acid composition of both storage proteins reveals that the 11. 3 S protein is particularly rich in aspartic and glutamic acid, while the 2. 2 S protein has few acidic amino acids. During imbibition and germination the globulin fraction declines rapidly, with a corresponding degradation of individual polypeptides of each protein. Polyclonal antibodies against each of the two proteins were produced and used for immunolocalization to determine the site of storage protein deposition within the quiescent spore. The proteins were sequestered in protein bodies of 2 to 10 micrometers, that are morphologically similar to those found in the seeds of flowering plants. The results suggest that spore globulins are biochemically similar to seed globulins, especially those found in some cruciferous seeds...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in {{non-timber forest products}} (NTFPs) has led to their greater recognition in sustainable forest management planning. This is evident in local resource management plans for the Robson Valley in east-central British Columbia, where public input shows {{strong support for the}} sustainable development of NTFP harvesting. However, information needed to develop sustainable management guidelines for NTFPs is currently lacking. We, therefore, undertook an inventory of non-timber forest product plant and fungal species in the Robson Valley. The distribution and abundance of NTFP plant species was determined by ecosystem types as described by the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification system used in British Columbia. Species with a relatively high abundance and commercial potential included the valuable medicinal plant Devil’s club (Oplopanax horridus), berry-producing species such as black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), and the edible <b>ostrich</b> <b>fern</b> (Matteuccia struthiopteris). Plants used for floral greenery that are relatively abundant in certain ecosystem types included falsebox (Paxistima myrsinites), tall Oregon-grape (Mahonia aquifolium), pearly everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea), and conifer boughs, especially from western redcedar (Thuja plicata). We identified a number of fungal species noted for their food, medicinal, wildcrafting, industrial, or traditional uses. Among the important food mushrooms we recorded in the Robson Valley were pine mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare), hedgehog mushroom (Hydnum repandum), and black morel (Morchella elata). Several information gaps were identified. We recommend that future research focus on gathering detailed information about selected NTFP species. Information describing habitats, growth requirements, production levels, and response to harvesting is needed to develop sustainable management strategies...|$|E
