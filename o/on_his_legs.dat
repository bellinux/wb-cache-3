5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did not intervene in the Genoese–Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula Kristó says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. While he was hunting in Zólyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a brown bear attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John Besenyő, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E
5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel. The protruding bones are isolated and bigger on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E

25|$|Paoli {{was fired}} from his {{professorship}} at the University of Puerto Rico and sentenced to twenty year's imprisonment, which was later reduced to ten. In jail, he shared his cell with Albizu Campos. Campos suffered from ulceration's <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and body allegedly caused by radiation and Paoli tended to his needs.|$|E
25|$|Marillier {{made his}} debut {{in place of}} Craig Wishart in the second match. The first ball he faced was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and so he flicked it away for three, which settled him. He put on 83 for the first wicket with Alistair Campbell before pulling a long hop to midwicket for 27. Their stand was a major reason why Zimbabwe won the match. In the third game he scored 47, in a {{partnership}} of 97 with Campbell.|$|E

25|$|Ötzi had a {{total of}} 61 tattoos (or Soot tattoos), {{consisting}} of 19 groups of black lines ranging from 1 to 3mm in thickness and 7 to 40mm long. These include groups of parallel lines running along the longitudinal axis of his body and to {{both sides of the}} lumbar spine, as well as a cruciform mark behind the right knee and on the right ankle, and parallel lines around the left wrist. The greatest concentration of markings is found <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> which together exhibit 12 groups of lines. A microscopic examination of samples collected from these tattoos revealed that they were created from pigment manufactured out of fireplace ash or soot.|$|E
25|$|The Green Man is {{featured}} in several films, such as The Draughtsman's Contract by Peter Greenaway (1982) {{and the first}} episode of The Canterbury Tales by Pier Paolo Pasolini (1972). The 2012 Disney film The Odd Life of Timothy Green also appears to depict a Green Man figure in its title character, a magical child who appears {{in the garden of}} a childless couple one night. He has leaves growing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> takes nourishment from sunlight and returns to the earth in the fall, after fulfilling his purpose. In the 1973 horror film The Wicker Man, the local tavern of Summerisle is named 'The Green Man', and is the haunt of a group of paganistic islanders.|$|E
25|$|Following the group's amicable disbandment in 1989, Edward Patten and William Guest formed {{their own}} {{production}} company in Detroit, titled Guest and Patten Productions, later renamed the Crew Entertainment Company. Patten {{was diagnosed with}} diabetes, which led to amputations <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and being confined to a wheelchair. He later died of complications from the disease on February 25, 2005 in Livonia, Michigan. William Guest continued to lead the company with members of Patten's family until his death from congestive heart failure in Detroit on December 24, 2015. Two years prior, Guest and his sister, Dame Dhyana Ziegler, Ph.D., released his autobiography, Midnight Train FROM Georgia: A Pip's Journey (Branden Books, Boston, MA, USA), about his life and career. In 2007, Bubba Knight and Guest, along with a third man, Neil Taffe (one of Gladys Knight's background singers), appeared in a commercial for Geico. In 1997, original Pips member Eleanor Guest died of heart failure.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} his injuries, Hemingway joined Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing trip in February, [...] but he was irascible and {{difficult}} to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, Hemingway fell into the fire while helping extinguish the flames, burning himself <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. Months later in Venice, Hemingway was diagnosed with two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull.|$|E
500|$|Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer, Ann's ex-boyfriend {{and lead}} singer of a band called [...] "Mouse Rat". He and Ann broke up after he {{admitted}} that he had delayed the removal of the casts <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> so that she would continue to pamper him. He now lives in a tent pitched in the pit next to Ann's house, so he can watch over her. After being injured when Leslie attempts to fill in the pit with dirt, he threatens to sue Pawnee in order to get money and impress Ann. Andy settles the lawsuit out of court however, when Leslie offers him a job as the shoe shiner in Pawnee town hall. It is here he begins to develop a romantic interest in intern April, feelings which she reciprocates.|$|E
500|$|The {{condemned}} were occasionally {{forced to}} watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. [...] The priest James Bell was in 1584 made {{to watch as}} his companion, John Finch, was [...] "a-quarter-inge". [...] Edward James and Francis Edwardes were made to witness Ralph Crockett's execution in 1588, {{in an effort to}} elicit their co-operation and acceptance of Elizabeth I's religious supremacy before they were themselves executed. [...] Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. [...] On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. [...] The aim was usually to cause strangulation and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest John Payne's death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> [...] Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular William Hacket (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally emasculated—the latter, according to Sir Edward Coke, to [...] "show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.".|$|E
6000|$|Bob Corkey growled {{a little}} as he wiped <b>his</b> knife <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>leg,</b> and {{accepted}} the allowance of [...] "grog," [...] which, however, was only pure water.|$|R

500|$|Garnet {{highlighted}} {{the date of}} his execution, 3 May, the Feast of the Cross, and reaffirmed his innocence. He defended Anne Vaux against claims that their relationship had been inappropriate. He then prayed {{at the base of}} the ladder, disrobed down to his long, sewn-up shirt, [...] "that the wind might not blow it up", and mounted the ladder. He ignored a Protestant minister who came forward, replying to an objectionable member of the audience that he [...] "ever meant to die a true but perfect Catholic". Bishop Overal protested that [...] "we are all Catholics", although Garnet disagreed with this. He once again said his prayers, and was then thrown off the ladder. [...] Before the executioner could cut him down alive, many in the crowd pulled <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> and as a result, Garnet did not suffer the remainder of his grim sentence. There was no applause when the executioner held Garnet's heart aloft and said the traditional words, [...] "Behold the heart of a traitor". His head was set on a pole on London Bridge, but crowds of onlookers fascinated by its pallid appearance eventually forced the government to turn the head upwards, so its face was no longer visible.|$|E
500|$|Lambert {{soon came}} to the {{attention}} of the medical profession, and shortly after his arrival in London, the Medical and Physical Journal published an article about him. They confirmed that he weighed , and measured his height as [...] A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that he breathed freely. Lambert was described as active and mentally alert, well-read, and with an excellent memory. He was fond of singing, and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs of pressure on the lungs. Doctors found tumefaction of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen, but other than scaly and thickened skin <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> caused by previous attacks of erysipelas, he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food. He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water, and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking. Lambert estimated that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400m) without difficulty. He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his window open, and was never heard to snore; on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes, and he never napped during the day.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, {{while in}} Africa, Hemingway was almost fatally injured in two {{successive}} plane crashes. He chartered a sightseeing flight over the Belgian Congo as a Christmas present to Mary. On {{their way to}} photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and [...] "crash landed in heavy brush". Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke two ribs. The next day, attempting to reach medical care in Entebbe, they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid. They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters {{and spent the next}} few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries. Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second degree burns <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. Months later in Venice, Mary reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway's injuries: two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull. The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been [...] "a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries." ...|$|E
