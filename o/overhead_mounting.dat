40|$|Various {{species of}} {{primates}} engage in greeting, a ritualized pattern of nonaggressive behavior that usually occurs during a reunion. Black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) perform <b>overhead</b> <b>mounting,</b> mounting, and embracing behavior soon after an aggressive act and in nonagonistic situations. We studied the pattern, distribution, {{and function of}} the greeting behavior in 2 captive groups of black-and-white colobus. <b>Overhead</b> <b>mounting</b> was the most frequent pattern, accounting for > 60 % of all greetings (N= 333). In nonagonistic situations, younger subordinate individuals greeted an older dominant individual more frequently than vice versa. A dominant male in a small multimale group frequently initiated contacts with adult females, though he was the oldest in the group. Conversely, the dominant male in a large 1 -male group never greeted group members. Immediately after performing the greeting, the greeter groomed the recipient {{in more than half}} the cases. In the large group, greeting frequency correlates positively with the age difference between the pair; however, there is no correlation between the relatedness, affiliation frequency, or aggression frequency of a pair in either the small or large group. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that greeting behavior functions as a tension-reducing mechanism in nonagonistic situations. There is no evidence, however, that greeting functions to express social status or to attract a mate. In addition, the frequent greeting by the adult male in the small multimale group may indicate that individuals affirm social bonds via greeting behavior...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTIn Section 4 I. 02 of {{the newly}} {{published}} Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), standards were specified for the placement of signal heads for traffic control signals at freeway entrance ramps, or ramp meters. For simultaneous operations, i. e. when ramp control signals are operated such that green signal indications are always displayed simultaneously {{to all of the}} lanes on the ramp, a minimum of two signal faces per ramp shall face entering traffic. For staggered operations, i. e. the ramp control signal are operated such that green signal indications are not always displayed simultaneously to all of the lanes on the ramp, one signal face shall be provided over the approximate center of each separately-controlled lane. Based on a nation-wide survey, it was realized that the two standards did not fully reflect the state-of-the-practice with respect to ramp metering operations. Due to the lack of significant conflicting movements at ramp meters, for any on-ramp lane, a minimum of one <b>overhead</b> <b>mounted,</b> or one upper and one lower roadside-mounted signal face is sufficient to control the metering operations. The minimum necessary number of signal faces changes according to the total number of lanes, how the signal faces are <b>mounted</b> (<b>overhead</b> or roadside <b>mounting),</b> and how the meters are operated (simultaneous or staggered). Suggestions are made to revise the two standards to better reflect the current nation-wide practices, and better consider the specific operational needs for ramp meters...|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a rotating bending fatique test machine for applying a rotating bending torque to a test object. The bending torque is produced by a rotating unbalanced weight in a rotating mounting and arranged {{at the end of}} a shaft part opposite to the test object. The test object is fixed to the shaft part on the one hand and to the machine frame on the other hand. There is a balancing weight which rotates about the same axis of rotation and at the same speed as the unbalance weight. The drive shaft drives the two weights simultaneously.

40|$|Existing People Counting System using {{a single}} <b>overhead</b> <b>mounted</b> camera has {{limitation}} in object recognition and counting in various environments.

The proposed system is counting the pedestrians by five process such as overhead image processing, frontal image processing, identical object recognition, facial age group classification and in-coming/out-going counting. The proposed system developed by C++, OpenCV and Kinect SDK, and it target group of 40 people(10 people by each age group) was setup for People Counting and Facial Age Group classification performance evaluation.

It is critical to post sign messages that can be quickly and clearlyunderstood by motorists, especially in high-volume traffic and construction/repairzones. Properly worded and formatted sign messages could spell the differencebetween comprehension and confusion. Message display factors investigated inthe study include display effects, color schemes, wording, and formats. Twoapproaches were employed in this study. First, a questionnaire survey wasdeveloped to collect motorists’ preferences regarding various message displayfactors. Second, a series of lab driving simulation experiments were set up toassess {{the effects of these}} factors and their interactions on motorists’comprehension of DMS messages. Study results suggested that static, one-framedmessages with more specific wording and no abbreviations were preferred. Amber or green or a green-amber combination were the most favored colors.

40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) in {{multimedia}} gaming is a dy-namic {{and exciting}} field of research. One {{of the challenges}} is to have multiple users interacting in the networked aug-mented reality environment. In recent years, camera-based body motion capturing console games, which capture the player’s body movement to control the objects rendered by the computer, have been developed. In this paper, we present a system called Tele-Table which allows multiple users to {{interact with each other}} through the network using real ob-jects. Each player’s set-up consists of an <b>overhead</b> <b>mounted</b> camera perceiving real objects, a plasma TV placed hori-zontally to act as a game table, and a computer. One of the most challenging tasks is data synchronization between two terminals. There are mainly three synchronization tasks we need to handle. They are temporal synchronization, spatial synchronization, and game states synchronization between the two terminals. We present these difficulties and present solutions and discussion to solve them. The design goals of the Tele-Table are real-time and realistic user experience. The features of the system are changeable background, us-ing real objects, and real-time networked augmented real-ity gaming between two terminals. We outline the system, present the detailed description, and discuss current achieve-ments...|$|R

It is also equipped with two banks of four smoke grenade launchers. Because mounting of the new turret increased {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 17.6 tonnes, a new more powerful engine had to be fitted. The new engine is the Caterpillar C9 engine developing 396 hp (295 kW) which is the same engine as the one found in recently acquired MOWAG Piranha III IFVs by the Romanian Land Forces. However the vehicle lost its ability to travel across water with little preparation and has to be specially prepared before entering water. The vehicle also became even wider (3.3 m) and higher (2.942 m) than its predecessor. Although the engine is more powerful, the weight of the new equipment has in fact decreased the vehicle's maximum road speed to 65 km/h.
