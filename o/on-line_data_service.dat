The iea has kindly allowed us free access to these through its <b>on-line</b> <b>data</b> <b>service.</b> We download {{the data from the}} iea web site as “Beyond 2020 ” files, one for oecd countries and one for non-oecd. For release, we update from the to the edition ([1], [2]). The next step is to extract data from the“Beyond 2020 ”files into csv files. When we did this, we knew only how to extract two-dimensional slices. Accordingly, we extracted (product, year) slices, of which there were for each year, each from the oecd and non-oecd files. As we did this manually, this step was somewhat laborious, and, worse, error-prone. We confined ourselves therefore to the previous and current gtap data reference years, and...|$|E

40|$|With {{the immense}} {{popularity}} of the Web, the world is witnessing an unprecedented demand for <b>on-line</b> <b>data</b> <b>services.</b> A growing number of applications require timely data delivery from information producers to thousands of information consumers. At the same time, the Internet is evolving towards an information superhighway that incorporates a wide mixture of existing and emerging communication technologies, including wireless, mobile, and hybrid networking. For this new computing landscape, this thesis advocates creating highly scalable <b>data</b> <b>services</b> based on adaptive hybrid data delivery. It introduces air-caching, a technique that effectively integrates broadcasting for massive dissemination of popular data, and unicasting for upon-request delivery of the rest. It describes the special properties, performance goals, and challenges of air-caching. Then, it presents adaptive cache management techniques for three different settings: servicing large numbers of data requests over a heavily accessed databases, propagating 1 data updates to mobile clients intermittently connected to information sources, and implementing publish/subscribe services again {{in the context of}} mobile computing...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 's {{the world}} has seen a {{paradigm}} shift in computing, from tightly coupled local-area networks to loosely coupled wide-area networks such asthe Internet. The sheer scale of the Internet causes significant problems for data access from remote servers, due to server loads and network latencies. With the growing user population of the Internet and the growing supply of <b>data</b> from <b>on-line</b> <b>services,</b> problems due to network congestion are likely to continue. Furthermore, a new trend in communications {{is the use of}} wireless networks to access <b>on-line</b> <b>data</b> <b>services.</b> In wireless environments the network bandwidth may not only be scarce, but it may initially be very expensive. In order to continue to provide scalable and economical access to data in this new computing environment, caching approaches must therefore focus on utilizing the network bandwidth and server resources effectively. This thesis considers query-based access to databases and document collections in such anenvironment. The work in this thesis is based on the premises that (1) the stream of queries posed by an application contains an abundance of information about the usage of data, which can be used to uncover the fundamental access characteristics of the application, and (2) the efficiency of applications can be improved if such application characteristics are understood and used to formulate new application-oriented caching and buffering techniques. The rst topic of the thesis is a new client caching architecture, called semantic caching, that focuses on supporting selection-based query workloads. For such workloads, semantic caching meets the challenges of the new computing environment outlined above by integrating support for query result caching, reduced network traffic, and application-oriented cache management policies. Application-oriented techniques {{can also be used to}} expedite the server's processing. The second topic of this thesis is a study of the interaction of an information retrieval application with the buffer manager of the server. Two buffering techniques are proposed and studied, that significantly improve the performance of the application...|$|R

S. Patent and Trademark Office to its network of Patent Depository Libraries (PDLs). The initial success of the system in the early 1980 s was so great that its rapidly increasing cost forced some curtailment of its expansion. In 1987 a pilot project was undertaken to determine whether CD-ROM supplied to the PDLs could substitute for some parts of the on-line service. This has proved successful in reducing the cost of the on-line service and further expansion of CD-ROM use to all PDLs is planned in 1989. ...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{academic}} finance literature {{has been devoted to}} theoretical principles concerning portfolio design, the efficient market and strategic asset allocation. Similarly, industry organization studies have been concerned with the fundamentals of firm structure, entry and exit from the industry, and spatial and industrial concentration. But finance is also a never-ending series of daily stories, issuing from the pink pages of respectable broadsheet newspapers and other print media and increasingly dominated by the cacophony of voices, images and events broadcast by television and <b>on-line</b> real-time <b>data</b> <b>services.</b> Finance has become a media event, with its breathless reporters and star anchorpersons more often approximating Entertainment Tonight or even (at the limit) MTV. This fact of financial life could be treated as ephemeral and of minor significance (compared to the "real" facts of economic principles). But financial institutions take it very seriously indeed. How and why this is the case are the topics of this paper. Drawing upon recent studies of the industry and media, as well as our own studies of the industry and its decision-making protocols, we sketch the elements of finance as entertainment. We emphasize the format and content of morning shows such as those broadcast on CNBC as well as the implications of programmes like these for the trading strategies of major financial conglomerates.

[1996]). Because of the intimate {{connection between the}} orbits of the Earth and Moon, the ephemeris of the latter is determined {{as part of the}} development of JPL’s planetary ephemerides. We use numerically integrated orbits {{as the basis for the}} ephemerides of most of the satellites. The exceptions are the Martian satellites, the five major Uranian satellites, Pluto’s satellite, and majority of the minor inner satellites. The orbits for the Martian satellites, Phobos and Deimos, are represented by the theory of Sinclair (1972, 1989) as extended by Morley (1990) and Jacobson (1996 a). Orbits from the ESAPHO and ESADE theories developed by Chapornt-Touz 6 (l 988, 1990 a, 1990 b) are also available.

40|$|The recent {{awakening}} to {{the reality}} of human-induced changes to the environment has resulted in an organized effort to promote global change research. The goal of this research as outlined by NASA's Earth System Science Committee (Earth System Science: A closer View, 1988) is to understand the entire Earth system on a global scale by describing how its component parts and their interactions have evolved, how they function, and how they may be expected to evolve on all timescales. The practical result is the capacity to predict that evolution over the next decade to century. Key variables important for the study of global change include external forcing factors (solar radiance, UV flux), radiatively and chemically important trace species (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, etc.), atmospheric response variables (temperature, pressure, winds), landsurface properties (river run-off, snow cover, albedo, soil moisture, vegetation cover), and oceanic variables (sea surface temperature, sea ice extent, sea level ocean wind stress, currents, chlorophyll, biogeochemical fluxes). The purpose of this document is to identify existing data sets available (both remotely sensed and in situ data) covering some of these variables. This is not intended to be a complete list of global change data, but merely a highlight of what is available. The information was extracted from the Master Directory (MD), an <b>on-line</b> scientific <b>data</b> information <b>service</b> which may be used by any researcher.
