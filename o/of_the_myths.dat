5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>myth's</b> {{results can}} only be {{replicated}} by expanding some parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> by a realistic and reasonable margin. This {{may have been due}} to facts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> having been altered slightly over time by it being told and re-told {{by the time it was}} tested by the MythBusters. Also, certain materials may have had to be substituted for others in some cases as a matter <b>of</b> necessity during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> being tested, but the new materials are almost always very similar to the materials specified and usually are readily available, so as to prevent it from being prohibitively costly or impractical.|$|R
5|$|Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who {{described}} Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Osiris <b>myth.</b> Herodotus, in <b>the</b> 5th century BCE, mentioned parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in his description <b>of</b> Egypt in <b>The</b> Histories, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in his Bibliotheca historica. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote {{the most complete}} ancient account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis of Egyptian religious beliefs. Plutarch's account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> is <b>the</b> version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. <b>The</b> writings <b>of</b> these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs. For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations of Egyptian belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work {{as a whole was}} not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.|$|R

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} Christianity did not curb the popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths.</b> With the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the Renaissance, {{the poetry of}} Ovid became {{a major influence on}} the imagination of poets, dramatists, musicians and artists.* L.

40|$|J. M. Coetzee’s <b>The</b> Master <b>of</b> Petersburg (1994) is a text about {{a father}} (Dostoevsky) {{mourning}} <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> his son.

Following Blanchot’s reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> I examine <b>the</b> contrasting Orphean and Eurydicean conducts – Orpheus desiring but, at the same time, destroying the other and Eurydice declining the other’s approach. I argue that Orpheus’s and Eurydice’s contrasting behaviours can be looked at as manifestations of a failure of love, one for its violence, the other for its neglect, and thus <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in <b>The</b> Master <b>of</b> Petersburg is meaningful in what it says about <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> intersubjectivity in Coetzee’s oeuvre...|$|R

25|$|In the Soviet 1982 miniseries Niccolo Paganini the {{musician}} is portrayed by the Armenian actor Vladimir Msryan.

An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string.

25|$|One common feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> is the {{emergence}} of the world from the waters of chaos that surround it. This event represents the establishment of maat and the origin of life. One fragmentary tradition centers on the eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the characteristics of the primeval water itself. Their actions give rise to the sun (represented in creation myths by various gods, especially Ra), whose birth forms a space of light and dryness within the dark water. The sun rises from the first mound of dry land, another common motif in the creation myths, which was likely inspired by the sight of mounds of earth emerging as the Nile flood receded. With {{the emergence}} of the sun god, the establisher of maat, the world has its first ruler. Accounts from the first millennium BC focus on the actions of the creator god in subduing the forces of chaos that threaten the newly ordered world.|$|E
25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a socio-historical {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{ways in which}} <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internal Threatening Other influences national politics and culture and inter-ethnic relations between the majority group (the dominant ethnic nation) and the minority (perceived as the foremost Threatening Other). The case-study under examination is that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish Jewish minority vis-a vis the Polish ethnic majority from <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> fully-fledged Polish exclusivist ethno-nationalism in the 1880 s up to the year 1968 which marks a final watershed in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Polish Jews - the purge and exile of most of its post-war remnants. The thesis examines <b>the</b> multi-faceted structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> its persistence and adaptability to different historical and socio-political conditions, and <b>the</b> variety <b>of</b> its uses in political culture: such as <b>the</b> purification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and dominant nation from the influence and presence of an ethnic minority; its role in anti-minority violence; in raising national cohesion; and in <b>the</b> delegitimisation <b>of</b> political enemies. <b>The</b> thesis is divided into six chapters.

25|$|Most {{chapters}} {{begin with}} brief re-tellings of creation myths that emerged as attempts {{to explain the}} origin of particular observed phenomena. Dawkins selects these myths from throughout the world, including Babylonian, Judeo-Christian, Aztec, Maori, Ancient Egyptian, Australian Aboriginal, Nordic, Hellenic, Chinese, Japanese, and other traditions. Chapter 9 ("Are we alone?") includes contemporary alien-abduction mythology; Chapter 4 ("What are things made of?") omits mythology altogether as Dawkins says that really small phenomena were unknown to primitive peoples prior to the invention of advanced optical magnification equipment, any texts they believed to be divinely inspired having failed to mention such useful knowledge as beyond human experience at the time. Dawkins also revisits his childhood and recalls his initial thoughts on these various phenomena or those thoughts expressed by his young contemporaries. Dawkins gives his critique of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths,</b> such as when {{he points out that}} much mythology involves some god's symbolic transgressive act performed just once, with Dawkins saying that such one-time acts would be inadequate to explain the mechanism as to why the phenomena continue to happen in unbroken cycles.|$|E

Ironic reinterpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> may have been popular: in addition to Orpheus' failure to charm the beasts, Martial mentions [...] "Daedalus" [...] being torn apart by another bear, mocking him with the words [...] "how you must wish you had your feathers now".|$|E
