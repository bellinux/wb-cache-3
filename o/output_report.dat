50|$|The Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS) is a {{telephone}} company trouble ticketing system to coordinate repairs of local loops (telephone lines). When {{a problem is}} reported to the Centralized Repair Service Answering Bureau (CRSAB) by a subscriber dialing the designated number (often (1)+611), it is filed and relayed through the Cross Front End, which is a link from the CRSAB to the LMOS network. The trouble report is then sent to the Front End via the Datakit network, where a Basic <b>Output</b> <b>Report</b> is requested (usually by a lineman). The BOR provides line information including past trouble history and MLT (Mechanized Loop Testing) tests. As LMOS is responsible for trouble reports, analysis, and similar related functions, MLT does the actual testing of customer loops. MLT hardware {{is located in the}} Repair Service Bureau.

50|$|Report mining is the {{extraction}} of data from human readable computer reports. Conventional data extraction requires a connection to a working source system, suitable connectivity standards or an API, and usually complex querying. By using the source system's standard reporting options, and directing the output to a spool file instead of to a printer, static reports can be generated suitable for offline analysis via report mining. This approach can avoid intensive CPU usage during business hours, can minimise end-user licence costs for ERP customers, and can offer very rapid prototyping and development of custom reports. Whereas data scraping and web scraping involve interacting with dynamic <b>output,</b> <b>report</b> mining involves extracting data from files in a human readable format, such as HTML, PDF, or text. These can be easily generated from almost any system by intercepting the data feed to a printer. This approach can provide a quick and simple route to obtaining data without needing to program an API to the source system.|$|E

40|$|Information System This paper {{outlines}} an approach, {{with both}} widespread implications and specific practical steps, for assembling {{some of the}} data that library adminis-trators now require {{in order to make}} libraries operate more effectively. These data have not been assembled in the past because the costs in staff time alone have been and continue to be prohibitive for most institutions. One major impediment to effective library administration is the lack of a comprehensive management information system (MIS). Some investigators in this area seem to have become fascinated with the potential value of various elusive and fugitive library statistical measures, but they have given little attention to the operational systems that would be required to assemble these data. The proposal outlined here stresses the need for a total systems approach, based upon standardized terminology, machine-aided data collection, and customized computer processing and reporting as well as systematic training and documentation. After the proposed MIS is developed, it can be offered to subscriber libraries by a bibliographic utility or network system at variable rates determined by input data volume, processing times, and <b>output</b> <b>report</b> requirements...|$|E
40|$|We {{specialize}} in clinical trial consultancy and management and pharmacokinetic and biostatistical analysis. Because we analyze {{data from a}} large number of bioequivalence studies for sponsors submitting applications to various national regulatory authorities, EquivTest has proved a very useful package. The first striking feature of EquivTest is its data management capability. The data we receive from crossover trials can be recorded as either multiple variables per subject or multiple records per subject. Rather than having to dictate to our clients which style we require, EquivTest can accommodate both styles. This, together with the broad range of packages supported in the import facility, makes data importation quick and effortless. Though most pharmacokinetic parameters in a bioequivalence study are analysed using parametric techniques, some need to be analysed using non-parametric techniques. Previously this entailed exporting the relevant data from one statistical package via a text file to a specialized non-parametric package. EquivTest gives us the option of including a non-parametric analysis in the <b>output</b> <b>report.</b> This feature is very useful and especially so when the assumptions underlying parametric analyses are in doubt...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{incentive}} regulation on health care. In the context of incentive-based health contracts, which might also introduce an incentive for the providers simply to report better treatment outcomes, evaluation of treatment using the information supplied by the providers (reported output) could be problematic. The systematic error on the <b>output</b> <b>report</b> is called providers' gaming behavior. This paper develops a general method for decomposing {{the effect of}} incentive-based contracts on performance into the true effect, {{which is the result}} of clinicians' improved effort induced by the contract, and the gaming effect, which is due to the change in the providers' reporting practice. The method follows the essence of linear structural relation (LISREL) models, and the true treatment output is modeled using a latent variable. Various output measures can be included in the structural evaluation model, but objective measure(s) (output measures not affected by providers' potential gaming) must be constructed based on available information to identify gaming through its correlation with the reported measures. The strengths of this method are that information from more than one output measure can be used, no monitoring system is required, and the construction of a gold-standard measure is not necessary. This method is applied to evaluate the impact of Maine's performance-based contracting on its public providers' substance-abuse services. Evidence of gaming is found in Maine's system, which remains robust in most of the sensitivity analyses. The methodology developed here can be used to evaluate the impact of a broad range of incentive-based contracts. Copyright (c) 1999 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
