5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and feed <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E

5|$|A few {{species of}} beetles are ectoparasitic on mammals. One such species, Platypsyllus castoris, parasitises beavers (Castor spp.). This beetle lives as a {{parasite}} {{both as a}} larva and as an adult, feeding on epidermal tissue and possibly <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> secretions and wound exudates. They are strikingly flattened dorsoventrally, no doubt as an adaptation for slipping between the beavers' hairs. They are wingless and eyeless, as are many other ectoparasites. Others are kleptoparasites of other invertebrates, such as the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) that infests honey bee nests, while many species are parasitic inquilines or commensal in the nests of ants. A few groups of beetles are primary parasitoids of other insects, feeding off of, and eventually killing their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{are divided}} into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their {{nourishment}} from feeding on the sebaceous secretions and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are scavengers, feeding <b>on</b> <b>skin,</b> fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host. Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt {{to find a new}} host.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the start}} of the 2012–13 season The Royal Opera has {{continued}} to mount around 20 productions and around seven new productions each season. The 2012–13 season opened with a revival of Der Ring des Nibelungen, directed by Keith Warner; new productions that season included Robert le diable, directed by Laurent Pelly, Eugene Onegin, directed by Holten, La donna del lago, directed by Fulljames, and the UK premiere of Written <b>on</b> <b>Skin,</b> composed by George Benjamin and directed by Katie Mitchell. Productions by the Studio Programme included the world premiere of David Bruce's The Firework-Maker's Daughter (inspired by Philip Pullman's novel of the same name), directed by Fulljames, and the UK stage premiere of Gerald Barry's The Importance of Being Earnest, directed by Ramin Gray.|$|E

5|$|Ever since Joseph Merrick's days as {{a novelty}} exhibit on Whitechapel Road, his {{condition}} {{has been a source}} of curiosity for medical professionals. His appearance at the meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1884 drew interest from the doctors present, but none of the answers nor the attention that Treves had hoped for. The case received only a brief mention in the British Medical Journal, and the Lancet declined to mention it at all. Four months later, in 1885, Treves brought the case before the meeting for a second time. By then, Tom Norman's shop on Whitechapel Road had been closed, and the Elephant Man had moved on. Without Merrick, Treves made do with the photographs he had taken during his examinations. One of the doctors present at the meeting was Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a dermatologist who was an authority <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> diseases. After hearing Treves's description of Merrick, and viewing the photographs, Crocker proposed that Merrick's condition might be a combination of dermatolysis, pachydermatocele and an unnamed bone deformity, all caused by changes in the nervous system. Crocker wrote about Merrick's case in his 1888 book Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment.|$|E

25|$|Urea accumulates, {{leading to}} {{azotemia}} and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy).

30|$|Interestingly, the pH <b>on</b> the <b>skin</b> is {{not only}} {{relevant}} in monitoring atopic and contact dermatitis (Seidenari et al. 1998), but significant changes in pH <b>on</b> the <b>skin</b> to higher values were also found in {{both males and females}} in the case of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Yosipovitch et al. 1993).

25|$|Electroporation is the {{application}} of short pulses of electric fields <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> and has proven to increase skin permeability. The pulses are high voltage and {{on the order of}} milliseconds when applied. Charged molecules penetrate the skin more frequently than neutral molecules after the skin has been exposed to electric field pulses. Results have shown molecules on the order of 100 micrometers to easily permeate electroporated skin.|$|E
25|$|Feathers are {{epidermal}} growths {{that form}} the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty.

25|$|Progesterone {{is used in}} {{combination}} with estrogen {{as a component of}} HRT for menopausal symptoms. A progestogen is needed to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and increased risk of endometrial cancer caused by unopposed estrogen in women with intact uteruses. In addition, progestogens, including progesterone, are able to treat and improve hot flashes. Progesterone, both alone and {{in combination}} with estrogen, also has beneficial effects <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> health and is able to slow the rate of skin aging in postmenopausal women.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-one bullous disease sera {{containing}} IgG anti-BMZ antibodies {{were examined}} by indirect immunofluorescence <b>on</b> intact <b>skin</b> and skin separated through the lamina lucida by incubation in 1. 0 M NaCl. All sera produced an indistinguishable pattern of linear immunofluorescence <b>on</b> intact <b>skin</b> at dilutions of 1 : 10 or higher. <b>On</b> separated <b>skin,</b> antibodies bound {{to either the}} epidermal (epidermal pattern), dermal (dermal pattern), or epidermal and dermal (combined pattern) sides of the separation. The binding patterns were consistent <b>on</b> separated <b>skin</b> from several donors and titers of antibasement membrane zone antibodies <b>on</b> separated <b>skin</b> were comparable to those <b>on</b> intact <b>skin.</b> Sera from 3 patients with herpes gestationis (HG), 36 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), and 1 patient with clinical and histologic features of epidermolysis bullosa aequisita (EBA) showed an epidermal pattern. Sera from 9 patients with BP showed a combined pattern and sera from 6 patients with EBA and 6 patients with clinical and histologic features of BP showed a dermal pattern. Indirect immunoelectron microscopy of selected sera showed antibodies producing the epidermal and combined patterns were anti-lamina lucida antibodies and those producing the dermal pattern were anti-sublamina densa antibodies. These results show indirect immunofluorescence <b>on</b> separated <b>skin</b> is a dependable method for differentiating bullous disease anti-lamina lucida and anti-sublamina densa antibodies and that differentiating between the antibodies is essential for accurate diagnosis in some patients. The results also suggest BP anti-lamina lucida antibodies may {{have more than one}} antigenic specificity...|$|R
