5|$|In January 1977, Victor diSuvero and {{his firm}} Sapphire-Yogo Mines became the next <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> tackle the Yogo dike. DiSuvero was a {{native-born}} Italian {{who grew up}} in Tientsin, China, and had been successful with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business. Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{constructing}} a road up Whiteface Mountain was first conceived {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries by Marcellus Leonard, an entrepreneur from Saranac Lake. The plans for the highway {{began to take shape}} in the 1920s when the land for the road was given by its <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> the state of New York on the condition that it would be named after America's Great War veterans. The road was later renamed to honor veterans from all wars. Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the dedication for the highway in 1929.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in {{a lawsuit against the}} company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber and other materials for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.|$|E
5|$|Hollamby died {{suddenly}} {{as a result}} of heart disease at Red House on 29 December 1999; he was the third <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> die while in residence. His funeral was held on 21 January 2000 in Eltham, with a secular humanist service conducted by Barbara Smoker. The Friends of Red House took over the public openings at this point. Amid ill health, Doris left Red House and moved into a care home in 2002; she died in April 2003. With the aid of an anonymous benefactor, the house was purchased and gifted to The National Trust in 2003, who turned it into a visitor's attraction, with tours continuing to be organised by the Friends of Red House.|$|E

5|$|Investors on Wall Street {{were putting}} their money into Marconi's system {{and some in}} the press began turning against Tesla's project, {{claiming}} it was a hoax, AuthorHouse, page 35 The project {{came to a halt}} in 1905 and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($ in today's dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> make the land a more viable real estate asset.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In 1988 Screamin' Toys produced a model kit where owners could {{build their own}} Jason statuette. The kit required the <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> cut and paint various parts in order to assemble the figure. Six years later, Screamin' Toys issued a new model kit for Jason Goes to Hell. Both kits are now out of production. McFarlane Toys released two toy lines, one in 1998 {{and the other in}} 2002. The first was a figure of Jason from Jason Goes to Hell, and the other was of Über-Jason from Jason X. Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film Freddy vs. Jason (2003). In April 2010 Sideshow Toys released a polystone statue of Jason, based on the version appearing in the 2009 remake.|$|E
5|$|The film {{proved to}} be very successful, inspiring other films about Nation to be {{produced}} by other studios; Biograph Company made Carrie Nation Smashing a Saloon in April, while Lubin Manufacturing Company had produced a film entitled Mrs. Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade by early March.

Lubin arranged with a Camden bar <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> film a staged destruction scene; however, the actress proved so convincing that bystanders began to destroy the bar for real and Lubin was forced to pay up to seven hundred dollars damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} break for The Kingston Trio came in late June 1957 when comedian Phyllis Diller {{canceled}} a week-long engagement at The Purple Onion club in San Francisco. When Werber persuaded the club's <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> give the untested Trio a chance, Guard sent out five hundred postcards to everyone {{that the three}} musicians knew in the Bay Area and Werber plastered the city with handbills announcing the engagement. When the crowds came, the Trio had been well prepared by months of work, and they achieved such local popularity that the initial week's engagement stretched to six months. Werber built upon this initial success, booking a national club tour in early 1958 for the Trio that included engagements at such prominent night spots as Mister Kelly's in Chicago, the Village Vanguard in New York, Storyville in Boston, and finally a return to San Francisco and its showcase nightclub, the Hungry i, in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|The town of Hamilton was {{conceived}} by George Hamilton (a {{son of a}} Queenston entrepreneur and founder, Robert Hamilton), when he purchased farm holdings of James Durand, the local Member of the British Legislative Assembly, shortly after the War of 1812. Nathaniel Hughson, a property <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare {{a proposal for a}} courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new Gore District, of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.|$|E

5|$|His wife Miriam Auhea Kekāuluohi was a {{widow and}} niece of Kamehameha I. She was also married to Kamehameha II before he {{converted}} to Christianity {{and gave up}} all but one wife. Kanaʻina and Kekāuluohi lived in a traditional aliʻi style home in a sacred neighborhood in Honolulu called Pohukaina near Kekūanāoʻa, Kaʻahumanu and their offspring. The compound would eventually become the Iolani Palace (the official Royal Residence of the Hawaiian Royal Family) and Palace Walk when Kekūanāoʻa built Hale Aliʻi {{in the center of}} the families estates as a gift to his daughter Victoria Kamāmalu. Kanaʻina kept his property at the palace until his death and would be the only original <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> do so while the Palace was in use, living there through five monarchs, from the 1820s to 1877. Kanaʻina's son, William Charles Lunalilo, was named by Kamehameha III as an heir to the throne of the kingdom and ascended in 1873 while his father still lived. Lunalilo died only a year later, three years before his father's death on March 13, 1877. Having not re-written his will, which left everything to his son who had predeceased, Kanaʻina died intestate. Probate hearings proceeded for 5 years. On final adjudication his property was auctioned with the proceeds going to several of Kanaʻina's cousins including Ruth Keelikōlani and Bernice Pauahi Bishop.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the <b>owner</b> <b>to</b> discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E
