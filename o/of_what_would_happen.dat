5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
25|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> for consumers, the CBO's {{methodology}} in {{a report}} in late July used a public plan with premiums about 10% lower than private plans.|$|E

25|$|A {{photograph}} of the teens' execution {{has been used for}} various purposes: Dutch right-wing political figure Geert Wilders used it in his short film Fitna as a warning <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to gays in a dystopian future in which Muslims rule the Netherlands, and it has been misrepresented in social media as Palestinians rather than Iranians hanging homosexuals.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{following}} the Lod Airport Massacre, where 17 Puerto Rican tourists, among others, in Israel were murdered by Japanese militants terrorists {{under the banner}} of the PLO, Rizk was forbidden to attend the Miss Universe 1972 in Puerto Rico to crown the title winner in fear of a revenge attack. She stated that she herself was scared to go in fear <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cantonal {{government}} {{refused to}} debate the issue again however, instead deciding on a three-step plan in December 2004 to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the language of schooling, allowing the municipalities to choose when they would make the switch. The decision not to publish any new teaching materials in the regional varieties was not overturned, however, raising the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> with those municipalities refused to introduce Rumantsch Grischun at all as the language of schooling is decided by the municipalities themselves in Grisons.|$|E

60|$|Again {{the banker}} pondered. Nobody {{knew better than}} he {{how many of the}} wheat-growers were near ruin that year, and he had {{naturally}} an accurate notion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>happen</b> to Leland when, after harvest, the wheat of the West was thrown train-load by train-load upon a lifeless market.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that the}} Prob(no. of heads ≤14heads) = 1 - Prob(no. of heads ≥ 14heads) + Prob(no. of head = 14) = 1 - 0.058 + 0.036 = 0.978; however, {{symmetry}} of the binomial distribution makes that an unnecessary computation {{to find the}} smaller of the two probabilities. Here, the calculated p-value exceeds 0.05, so the observation {{is consistent with the}} null hypothesis, as it falls within the range <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> 95% of the time were the coin in fact fair. Hence, the null hypothesis at the 5% level is not rejected. Although the coin did not fall evenly, the deviation from expected outcome is small enough to be consistent with chance.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Legend of Gunung Ledang, Sultan Mahmud of Malacca sends his emissary, Hang Tuah, to Gunung Ledang {{to present his}} royal proposal of marriage to the mystical Princess of Mount Ledang. The Princess and Hang Tuah are independently famous figures of Malayan history-mythology, {{and it is only}} in this specific story that the two briefly cross paths, though in some versions of the tale it is Tun Mamat, not Tuah, who presents the proposal to the Princess as Tuah was too old and weak to reach the mountain peak. The original concept of the Puteri Gunung Ledang, as pitched by Mamat Khalid, was to pose the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if these two characters had met and fallen in love.|$|E
500|$|The Committee {{did little}} to {{demonstrate}} the extent of communist activity in the United States. [...] In its analysis <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if capitalism were overthrown and replaced by communism, it warned of widespread misery and hunger, the confiscation of and nationalization of all property, {{and the beginning of}} [...] "a program of terror, fear, extermination, and destruction." [...] Anti-Bolshevik public sentiment surged after release of the report and ensuing publicity.|$|E
50|$|TSR also {{released}} {{comic book}} series through DC Comics in 1988-89. It {{did not include}} any characters from the Revenge of the Factoids expansion set. The series only ran 10 issues and was canceled {{near the end of}} 1989 due to poor sales. The end of issue #10 included a brief summary <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> had the series continued.|$|R
60|$|Harry had {{no doubt}} that the {{assurance}} was given in earnest. The fall of Seringapatam, and the death of Tippoo, had been a terrible shock to the rajah; and even {{the fact that he had}} missed his opportunity of allying himself with the English, was as nothing to the thought <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> had he declared for Tippoo.|$|R
60|$|He {{had slipped}} {{out between the}} contending parties into this liberty <b>of</b> the twilight. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> next? <b>What</b> was happening? He figured the red-clad men as busily hunting him, driving the black-badged revolutionists before them.|$|R
500|$|The script {{went through}} many stages. In early 1965, when backing was secured for the film, Clarke and Kubrick {{still had no}} firm idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to Bowman after the Star Gate sequence. Initially all of Discoverys astronauts were to survive the journey; by October 3, Clarke and Kubrick had decided to leave Bowman the sole {{survivor}} and have him regress to infancy. By October 17, Kubrick {{had come up with}} what Clarke called a [...] "wild idea of slightly fag robots who create a Victorian environment to put our heroes at their ease." [...] HAL 9000 was originally named Athena after the Greek goddess of wisdom and had a feminine voice and persona.|$|E
500|$|In {{defending}} his conservatism, Brownlee emphasized that [...] "history {{has yet to}} record a single instance of the revolutionary method that has not resulted in a welter of discord and misery" [...] and mused that [...] "if the results were not so tragical, I {{would like to see}} Canada put under the most extreme form of socialistic or communistic Government in order that our people could have the actual experience <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> and learn for themselves the lesson that in our present day world situation, one nation cannot fashion for itself any level of prosperity regardless of the position {{of the rest of the}} world". [...] Even as he rejected the radical solutions posed by others, Brownlee had no solutions of his own to offer but government thrift and moderate debt adjustment.|$|E
500|$|Moffat wrote six episodes for the series. The {{rest were}} penned by guest writers, as Moffat {{believed}} that Doctor Who benefited from different voices. However, {{he stated that}} the concepts of the episodes were mostly supplied by him, as he had a [...] "pretty good idea" [...] <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> in each episode slot. Moffat knew all of the guest writers [...] "to some degree" [...] and called meeting with them [...] "quite joyous". However, Matthew Graham, co-creator of Life on Mars and writer of the second series episode [...] "Fear Her", {{was not able to}} write an episode as he was slated to because he did not believe he would have enough time. Moffat later contacted him and asked him to write a two-part episode for the next series, which became [...] "The Rebel Flesh"/"The Almost People".|$|E
50|$|The Baseball Time Machine allowed {{players to}} try to resolve the most famous {{baseball}} arguments <b>of</b> all time, <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if Sandy Koufax pitched to Babe Ruth?, How would the 1927 Yankees do against the Big Red Machine?, etc.|$|R
60|$|Austin considered. He was by {{no means}} sure that the launch had power enough to tow the lighter clear, and the long white seething on the jagged lava astern <b>of</b> her {{suggested}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if she failed to do it.|$|R
50|$|But Major Ruben Prien of the Project {{still has}} {{residual}} memories <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened.</b> He {{is able to}} put the pieces together. He finds another time traveller, more or less stranded in the present (the 1970s) by Morley's actions. The time traveller is {{able to go to}} the point where Morley had altered time, and prevent Morley's actions. The original timeline, with the Project, is now back in place.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the success}} of [...] (2003), {{the cast and crew}} signed on for two more sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writer Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio decided not to make the sequels new adventures featuring the same characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, but to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy.

500|$|The {{unresolved}} question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to the Mersey estuary if {{the canal}} was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was {{asked how he}} would avoid such a problem. His reply, [...] "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, and then I would strike inland", prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. [...] Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. Certain conditions were attached; £5million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.|$|E
500|$|According to the Pentagon Papers, [...] "the {{critical}} failure of both reports was {{to understand the}} fundamental political role that the army was coming to play in Vietnam". The papers concluded the ARVN was the only institution capable of deposing and replacing Diệm. Diệm and Nhu fully realized the potential threat, responding with the divide and conquer paradigm. They usurped the prerogative of senior officer promotion and appointed generals based on loyalty to the palace, giving orders directly to officers. This action caused deep distrust among the senior officers and fragmented their power. Krulak failed to realize that if the situation deteriorated to the point where discontent with Diệm posed the possibility of a communist victory, the generals would intervene in politics because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to them under communist rule. Neither Krulak nor Mendenhall seemed to anticipate that if a military junta came to power, the divisive effect of Diệm's promotion politics would manifest itself as the generals vied for power. Neither of the pair put any emphasis on the detrimental effects that would have been caused by political infighting among the generals.|$|E
50|$|The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln (2012) {{is a legal}} drama-turned-thriller whose plot {{revolves}} around the speculation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> had Abraham Lincoln survived his assassination and gone on to be impeached for exceeding his constitutional authority during the American Civil War. The protagonist Abigail, a young, female, black law graduate, experiences various misadventures in post-War Washington, D.C. as she assists on the President's legal defense team.|$|R
6000|$|Upon the {{immediate}} logical and legal {{origin of the}} English interest {{there can be no}} rational debate. There are some things so simple that one can almost prove them with plans and diagrams, as in Euclid. One could make a kind of comic calendar <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> to the English diplomatist, if he had been silenced every time by Prussian diplomacy. Suppose we arrange it {{in the form of a}} kind of diary: ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the worst}} thing he could have done. George had almost made up his mind to take a chance when the sheet was {{snatched}} from his grasp {{as if it had been}} some live thing deliberately eluding his clutch. The thought <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> had this occurred when he was in mid-air caused him to break out in a cold perspiration. He retired a pace and perched himself on the rail of the balcony.|$|R

2500|$|Dave Chappelle lampooned what he {{perceived}} as the targeting of minority cast members for criticism or ejection on the show on his Comedy Central sketch comedy show, Chappelle's Show, with a sketch entitled [...] "The Mad Real World", portraying, with hyperbole, the results <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if one white person were to cohabitate {{with a collection of}} crazy black people.|$|E
2500|$|First with Schapiro {{and then}} Jeremy Flint, Reese {{initially}} created the Little Major bidding {{system as a}} warning <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if the development of artificial bidding systems was allowed to go unchecked. However, under this camouflage, the system was a genuine attempt with interesting features. Ultimately, the system was abandoned when its two-year EBU 'A' license was withdrawn [...] "on the grounds that not enough players were playing the system".|$|E
5000|$|... "Not a Drop of Rain" [...] is Keen's {{personal}} favorite from the album, [...] "It's {{a very emotional}} song, written out <b>of</b> thinking <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if I lost everything I have." [...] The song has a somewhat unusual guitar accompaniment played in DADGAD tuning and its structure eschews the traditional verse/chorus/verse song structure. [...] Singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin {{fell in love with}} the song and began performing it. [...] Her version was recorded in studio and released in 2002 on a compilation by radio station KGSR.|$|R
50|$|Counterfactual {{treatments}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> had Richard III won the Battle of Bosworth {{and killed}} Richmond instead are rare within the alternate history subgenre of science fiction. One rare exception is Andre Norton's The Crossroads of Time (1956/1962), in which Ferdinand and Isabella also fail to subdue Grenada. Thus, John Cabot discovers America (or Cabotland, {{as it is}} called here), amidst other historical alterations. While Richard III plays a minor role, Norton's sympathies seem Ricardian in this context.|$|R
60|$|Fright succeeded consternation, and I {{began to}} tremble.

I almost fainted. The thought of heroic Don saved me, and the weak moment passed.|$|R
