5|$|By July7, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> {{convection}} {{associated with}} Blanca had dissipated, {{and the remaining}} convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June22, {{satellite}} imagery indicated {{the formation of an}} eyewall; by this time Andres was near hurricane-status. Early the next day, the center of circulation became embedded within a central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mbar (hPa; 29.06inHg); the storm was located roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity. Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection associated with the storm had weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75mph (120km/h) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres.|$|E

5|$|Late on September 3, an eye {{began to}} form in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> {{convection}} as Henriette turned to the northwest.

The hurricane quickly crossed {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Peninsula and emerged into the Pacific Ocean again as a weakened 85mph (135km/h) cyclone with disrupted convection near the center. Convection gradually waned as the hurricane moved over progressively colder waters, and on September 6 Henriette weakened to a tropical depression. The storm turned to the west, and gradually weakened until dissipating on September 8.|$|E

5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase. Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became embedded within an area strong, divergent, upper-level winds. Increasing in forward motion, the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection.|$|E
5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module {{does not appear to}} significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, {{with one of them}} leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, {{near the center of the}} low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-developed}} tropical wave exited Africa on August 27. The next day, {{it developed}} into a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter it intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. On August 29, it passed just south of Cape Verde as it continued intensifying on its west-northwest track. An eye feature appeared in the convection on August 31, suggesting winds of near hurricane status; since the feature was located {{on the western side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection and the storm was slightly asymmetric, the intensity was held just below hurricane status. Shortly after, strong wind shear caused the storm to deteriorate, leaving the low-level circulation exposed on the western side. Beryl weakened to a tropical depression the next day {{due to the lack of}} convection, and it continued westward without redevelopment. On September 5, a reconnaissance flight into the depression found winds of 65mph (100km/h); this was deemed unrepresentative of the actual intensity as it was recorded in a squall line. The depression became disorganized once more and by September 6, it was no longer identifiable on satellites.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Kyle tracked north-northeastward before {{gradually}} executing a clockwise loop. Initially, {{the circulation}} center remained partly {{exposed to the}} south and west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection. On September22, the convection increased around the center as the system developed a warm thermal core, and as a result it was reclassified as a fully tropical cyclone. A building anticyclone to the northwest turned Kyle to the southwest. After the storm briefly weakened, previously moderate wind shear began decreasing, which allowed convection to deepen and the outflow over the cyclone to improve. Tracking over progressively warmer waters, Kyle began developing a banding eye feature late on September24. Slow strengthening continued, and the storm attained hurricane status at 1200UTC on September25. The next day, Kyle reached peak winds of 85mph (130km/h) about 490miles east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
