This work reports on the fluxes of red blood cell aggregates of various sizes in a T-shaped microchannel, aiming to clarify the effects of different flow conditions in the <b>outlet</b> <b>branches</b> of the channel. Image analysis techniques, were utilised, and moderately aggregating human red blood cell suspensions were tested in symmetric (∼ 50 - 50 %) and asymmetric flow splits through the two <b>outlet</b> (daughter) <b>branches.</b> The results revealed that the flux decreases with aggregate size in the inlet (parent) and daughter branches, mainly due to the fact that the number of larger structures is significantly smaller than that of smaller structures. However, when the flux in the daughter branches is examined relative to the aggregate size flux in the parent branch an increase with aggregate size is observed for a range of asymmetric flow splits. This increase is attributed to size distribution and local concentration changes in the daughter branches. The results show that the flow of larger aggregates is not suppressed downstream of a bifurcation, and that blood flow is maintained, for physiological levels of red blood cell aggregation...|$|R

The mixing performance was analyzed {{in terms of}} the DOM (degree of mixing) and the pressure load between the two inlets and outlet. Four different baffle configurations were designed and simulated to determine how they affect the mixing performance of a T-shaped microchannel. Among the four baffle configurations, a cyclic configuration of baffles produced the best results. It exhibited the fastest growth in the DOM along the microchannel. The cyclic configuration means that four baffles are attached to four side walls of the channel in a cyclic order. The mixing improvement occurs in two ways. One is in the baffle region, when the cyclic configuration causes the fluid flow to rotate in the cross section, unlike other configurations. The other improvement is observed in the remaining <b>outlet</b> <b>branch</b> after the baffle region. This improvement is due to twisting and elongation of the boundary between two fluids. The baffle size and the interval between two consecutive baffles are shown to be optimized {{in terms of the}} DOM for a given condition...|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{studies of}} blood flow in {{cerebrovascular}} aneurysms have potential to improve patient treatment planning by enabling clinicians and engineers to model patient-specific geometries and compute predictors and risks prior to neurovascular intervention. However, {{the use of}} patient-specific computational models in clinical settings is unfeasible due to their complexity, computationally intensive and time-consuming nature. An important factor contributing to this challenge is the choice of outlet boundary conditions, which often involves a trade-off between physiological accuracy, patient-specificity, simplicity and speed. In this study, we analyze how resistance and impedance outlet boundary conditions affect blood flow velocities, wall shear stresses and pressure distributions in a patient-specific model of a cerebrovascular aneurysm. We also use geometrical manipulation techniques to obtain {{a model of the}} patient’s vasculature prior to aneurysm development, and study how forces and stresses may {{have been involved in the}} initiation of aneurysm growth. Our CFD results show that the nature of the prescribed outlet boundary conditions is not as important as the relative distributions of blood flow through each <b>outlet</b> <b>branch.</b> As long as the appropriate parameters are chosen to keep these flow distributions consistent with physiology, resistance boundary conditions, which are simpler, easier to use and more practical than their impedance counterparts, are sufficient to study aneurysm pathophysiology, since they predict very similar wall shear stresses, time-averaged wall shear stresses, time-averaged pressures, and blood flow patterns and velocities. The only situations where the use of impedance boundary conditions should be prioritized is if pressure waveforms are being analyzed, or if local pressure distributions are being evaluated at specific time points, especially at peak systole, where the use of resistance boundary conditions leads to unnaturally large pressure pulses. In addition, we show that in this specific patient, the region of the blood vessel where the neck of the aneurysm developed was subject to abnormally high wall shear stresses, and that regions surrounding blebs on the aneurysmal surface were subject to low, oscillatory wall shear stresses. Computational models using resistance outlet boundary conditions may be suitable to study patient-specific aneurysm progression in a clinical setting, although several other challenges must be addressed before these tools can be applied clinically.

40|$|When {{streams of}} rapidly moving flow merge in a T-junction, the {{potential}} arises for large oscillations at {{the scale of}} the diameter, D, with a period scaling as O(D/U), where U is the characteristic flow velocity. If the streams are of different temperatures, the oscillations result in experimental fluctuations (thermal striping) at the pipe wall in the <b>outlet</b> <b>branch</b> that can accelerate thermal-mechanical fatigue and ultimately cause pipe failure. The importance of this phenomenon has prompted the nuclear energy modeling and simulation community to establish a benchmark to test the ability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes to predict thermal striping. The benchmark is based on thermal and velocity data measured in an experiment designed specifically for this purpose. Thermal striping is intrinsically unsteady and hence not accessible to steady state simulation approaches such as steady state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. 1 Consequently, one must consider either unsteady RANS or large eddy simulation (LES). This report compares the results for three LES codes: Nek 5000, developed at Argonne National Laboratory (USA), and Cabaret and Conv 3 D, developed at the Moscow Institute of Nuclear Energy Safety at (IBRAE) in Russia. Nek 5000 is based on the spectral element method (SEM), which is a high-order weighted residual technique that combines the geometric flexibility of the finite element method (FEM) with the tensor-product efficiencies of spectral methods. Cabaret is a 'compact accurately boundary-adjusting high-resolution technique' for fluid dynamics simulation. The method is second-order accurate on nonuniform grids in space and time, and has a small dispersion error and computational stencil defined within one space-time cell. The scheme is equipped with a conservative nonlinear correction procedure based on the maximum principle. CONV 3 D is based on the immersed boundary method and is validated on a wide set of the experimental and benchmark data. The numerical scheme has a very small scheme diffusion and is the second and the first order accurate in space and time, correspondingly. We compare and contrast simulation results for three computational fluid dynamics codes CABARET, Conv 3 D, and Nek 5000 for the T-junction thermal striping problem that was the focus of a recent OECD/NEA blind benchmark. The corresponding codes utilize finite-difference implicit large eddy simulation (ILES), finite-volume LES on fully staggered grids, and an LES spectral element method (SEM), respectively. The simulations results are in a good agreement with experimenatl data. We present results from a study of sensitivity to computational mesh and time integration interval, and discuss the next steps in the simulation of this problem...|$|E

Near the bifurcation, the fluid is partitioned between the two outlets according to the imposed pressure difference Δ p=p_OUT 1 -p_OUT 2. Specifically, if Δ p= 0 and if the outlet channels have the same height and length, it is Q_ 1 [...] Q_ 2, where Q_ 1 and Q_ 2 are the flow rates through the main and side <b>outlet</b> <b>branches,</b> respectively. (Actually, these two flow rates are not exactly equal because the bifurcation is asymmetric). In case of Δ p> 0 (Δ p< 0), the fluid encounters a higher resistance in the main channel (side channel) and prevalently moves through the other branch, i.e., Q_ 2 > Q_ 1 (Q_ 1 > Q_ 2). Of course, {{there will be two}} limiting values of Δ p (one positive and one negative) such that the fluid totally passes through only one outlet. In the general case, a critical streamline dividing the inflow section in two regions corresponding to the fluid portion that ends up in the two outlets can be identified.

A setup was built which consists of two parts: a flow conditioner and a test section. The flow conditioner creates a two-phase mixtures (R 32) at a saturation temperature between 10 °C and 20 °C with a mass flux of 150 to 700 kg/(m². s) and a vapour quality between 0 and 1. In the test section, the two-phase flow is distributed over two identical parallel sections using an impacting T-junction. The backpressure and heat input of each parallel section can be regulated. The mass flow rates and vapour qualities are measured {{before and after the}} T-junction. Further, the pressure gradient over the T-junction is measured and the void fraction is determined before the T-junction using a capacitive void fraction sensor. Using design of experiments, the main effects of superficial vapour velocity, superficial liquid velocity and saturation pressure on the distribution of R 32 were studied. For R 32, the two phases only distribute uniformly over the T-junction when the mass flow rate through the two <b>outlet</b> <b>branches</b> is equal. Further, the experiments show a decreased tendency of the liquid to exit through the outlet with the lowest mass flow rate with increasing vapour superficial velocity.
