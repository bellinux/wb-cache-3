5|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{designated}} as Tropical Storm Ida on November4, the government <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> issued {{a tropical storm}} warning for the entire coastline <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua,</b> {{and the government of}} Columbia also issued a warning for the nearby islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Later that day, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Bluefields and the Nicaragua–Honduras border. As Ida moved closer to land, the tropical storm warning for San Andrés and Providencia was discontinued. Several hours later, the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were modified to cover areas south of the Nicaragua–Honduras border to Puerto Cabezas and a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of Puerto Cabezas to Bluefields. After Ida made landfall in Nicaragua, all hurricane advisories were discontinued and replaced by a tropical storm warning. Shortly thereafter, a tropical storm watch was declared for areas along the Honduran coastline between Limón and the Nicaragua–Honduras border. However, all watches and warnings were discontinued once Ida weakened to a tropical depression on November6.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> at 6:16p.m. on September 2. Some damage was also reported in Costa Rica.

It created tsunamis disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shock of}} the {{earthquake}} occurred at 0:16 GMT and was followed by several strong aftershocks. The quake was most widely felt in the Chinandega and León departments <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua,</b> though it was also felt elsewhere in Nicaragua at El Crucero, Managua and San Marcos and at San José in Costa Rica. It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since the earthquake of 1972.|$|E

5|$|While {{over the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea, Odette dropped heavy rainfall, {{including}} {{prior to its}} formation. For several days, the storm caused rains in Panama, Costa Rica, and the east coast <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua.</b> In Colombia, the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8inches (200mm) in Puerto Colombia. In Jamaica, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, flooding several roads in Saint Ann and Saint Mary Parishes. Odette caused moderate damage and 8 deaths in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} organized into a tropical depression {{off the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> on October 9. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm on October 10. Subsequent to crossing western Cuba, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late on October 12. It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary. Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on October 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the frontal boundary on October 14.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed east <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> on May25, executing a counterclockwise loop over Central America. After weakening over land, Alice re-intensified over the western Caribbean, moving over western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50mph (80km/h). On June1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Alice quickly weakened {{due to a}} cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June3. While near Cuba, Alice produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua.</b> Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1953, {{an unusually}} {{long-lasting}} upper-level low persisted across Mexico and Central America.

The system weakened over land, but it re-intensified over the western Caribbean Sea, moving over western Cuba as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm on May 31. Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1, when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Miriam, the flood and mudslide warnings issued because of Joan were not lifted until October 23 and 25.

Guatemala was placed under a warning on October 24. In addition, new flash flood and mudslide warnings were raised for Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas on October 24 and 25, respectively. All warnings and watches were discontinued later on October 25 as Miriam {{turned away from}} the coast.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population weathered the storm in poorly constructed shelters. To {{be able to respond}} to an emergency following Beta, the government <b>of</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E
