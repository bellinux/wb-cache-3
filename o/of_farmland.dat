5|$|Irrigation systems: In {{the modern}} Sichuan region {{belonging}} to the State of Qin of ancient China, the Dujiangyan Irrigation System devised by the Qin Chinese hydrologist and irrigation engineer Li Bing was built in 256 BCE to irrigate a vast area <b>of</b> <b>farmland</b> that today still supplies water. By the 2nd century AD, during the Han Dynasty, the Chinese also used chain pumps that lifted water from a lower elevation to higher one. These were powered by manual foot pedal, hydraulic waterwheels, or rotating mechanical wheels pulled by oxen. The water was used for public works of providing water for urban residential quarters and palace gardens, but mostly for irrigation <b>of</b> <b>farmland</b> canals and channels in the fields.|$|E
40|$|Although condtion <b>of</b> {{gradient}} <b>of</b> <b>farmlands</b> is {{an important}} index to measure agricultural condition, this index is not adopted properly as the index of existing criteria to select target areas for financial supports to hilly and mountainious areas. Therefore, in this paper, we verified the criteria by condition <b>of</b> gradient <b>of</b> <b>farmlands.</b> From the results, it was clarified that these criteria didn't reflect condition <b>of</b> gradient <b>of</b> <b>farmlands</b> sufficiently. As the conclusion, to select criteria for measures to hilly and mountainous areas properly, indexes that show disadvantage agricultural and socio-economic conditions should be adopted...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the effects of direct payment in hilly and mountainous areas for {{maintaining}} ecological functions <b>of</b> <b>farmlands.</b> Two villages in the upstream district of Tokamachi-shi, Niigata Prefecture were selected as study sites for a comparison of land use and farmland management. First, patterns of land use and aspects of the local environment that made farming difficult were analyzed by using GIS. Topographic differences between still-cultivated farmlands and abandoned ones were compared in terms of two of these aspects: distance from managed farm roads and degrees of slope. We found that abandoned farmlands were further from roads and steeper than cultivated ones. Maintenance of the levees around the farmlands ceased completely after cultivation was abandoned. Secondly, we conducted a survey {{to determine how the}} local farmlands were managed and how the subsidy was affecting the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>farmlands.</b> We found that the scheme was having little effect on the re-cultivation <b>of</b> once-abandoned <b>farmlands</b> or the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>farmlands.</b> However, the subsidy was being used for joint activities by the villagers and was having a positive effect on village revitalization. It was apparent that a clear vision of those measures that could help promote the ecological functions <b>of</b> local <b>farmlands</b> was needed for the effective use of the subsidy. In conclusion, we made the following points on the maintenance and promotion of the ecological functions <b>of</b> <b>farmlands</b> and woodlands. 1) To maintain the ecological functions <b>of</b> <b>farmlands,</b> and {{as an alternative to the}} current scheme, we need a new scheme that has clear objectives with regard to the management <b>of</b> both abandoned <b>farmlands</b> and still-cultivated ones. 2) Farmers need to receive assistance in the management of woodlands, because afforestation is a legitimate way to prevent decline in the ecological functions <b>of</b> abandoned <b>farmlands</b> in areas where re-cultivation is difficult and where shrubs and trees have already begun to invade...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 a, b {{indicate}} that the volumetric water content of the surface soil and subsoil <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> was comparable with that <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland</b> when the water suction was below 10  kPa, but that the volumetric water content <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> was less than that <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland</b> when the water suction was greater than 10  kPa. As shown in Fig.  4 c, the volumetric water content of the substratum soil <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> was comparable with that <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland</b> when the water suction was below 5  kPa. However, when the water suction was beyond 5  kPa, the volumetric water content <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> decreased very quickly to a low level and was less than that <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland.</b> For most soils, field capacity was estimated at the water potential of –  10 to −  33  kPa (Brady and Weil 2008). The volumetric water content of the surface soil and subsoil <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> began {{to be less than}} that <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland</b> after the field capacity was reached, while the volumetric water content of the substratum soil <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> started to be less than that <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland</b> before the field capacity was reached, indicating that the substratum soil (sediment) <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland</b> drained water very quickly and had low capacity to retain water. There was difference in the shape and range in soil water characteristic curve of the two kinds of sampling sites shown in Fig.  4, which may be due to that there was more clay content in the surface soil, subsoil and substratum soil <b>of</b> the unaltered <b>farmland</b> than that <b>of</b> the reclaimed <b>farmland,</b> respectively, as shown in Table  1. The greater the clay content, in general, the greater the water retention at any particular suction, and the more gradual the slope of the curve (Hillel 1998).|$|R
