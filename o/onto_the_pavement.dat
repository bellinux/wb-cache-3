She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement,</b> suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E

First a small layer of coarse concrete, the rudus, then a little layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> or statumen. Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the summa crusta. The crusta was crowned for drainage.|$|E

Though scuola {{developed}} a primary meaning of [...] "school", in Venice these organisations retain their medieval Latin meaning of confraternities, social organisations founded on spiritual principles. Their main buildings were typically used as meeting and assembly halls, and for the distribution of charity. The founders of San Giovanni were a confraternity of flagellants {{who took part in}} religious ceremonies, whipping their backs and spraying blood <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavements</b> as they processed through the city.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{construction}} and building industry {{was identified as}} an important market {{for the use of}} photocatalytic products since they can be applied to reduce building facades maintenance costs and also the pollution effects, particularly important in metropolis with high population density. The multifunctional capability of these materials will be promoted by the photocatalytic oxidation of pollutant agents. In this research work it was studied and developed a process to produce road pavements formulations with tailored properties that will and promote photocatalytic and self-cleaning effects. This can empower the production of non-slipping surfaces important to avoid accidents that occurs due to the combination of the first autumn rains and adsorbed oils and other organic compounds <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement’s</b> surfaces. To integrate the semiconductor material, two application methods were used: a water-based TiO 2 nanoparticles solution, applied by spraying, and using TiO 2 nanoparticles by volume incorporation to the base asphalt mixture.

Kanō was selected to represent Japan at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics.

25|$|After {{leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation, the Bulldogs {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling, {{and also to}} All Japan Pro Wrestling. Stampede officials were hopeful that {{the return of the}} Bulldogs would revive a struggling promotion, but they were unsuccessful. Eventually in May 1989, {{the decision was made to}} split up the Bulldogs, which caused some problems with All Japan owner Shohei Baba, who was still promoting the Bulldogs as a tag team. On 4 July 1989 Smith, along with fellow wrestlers Chris Benoit, Ross Hart, and Jason the Terrible, was involved in a serious automobile accident. Smith, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, needed 135 stitches after slamming his head through the windshield and being thrown 25 feet <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b> He recovered, and the Bulldogs continued teaming in All Japan against teams such as Joe and Dean Malenko, Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and The Nasty Boys. Personal problems began to surface between Smith and Billington, and Smith later left All Japan to return to the WWF.|$|E
50|$|Nothomyrmecia macrops {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the most primitive living ant and, as such, has aroused considerable interest among the entomological community. Following its rediscovery it {{was the subject of a}} prolonged and rigorous series of studies involving Australian, American and European ant specialists and it soon became one of the most studied ant species on the planet. Nothomyrmecia can be cultured with ease, and could potentially prove a useful subject for research into learning in insects as well as the physiology of nocturnal vision. Since its chance discovery at Poochera, the town has become of international interest to myrmecologists, and it is possibly the only town in the world with ant-based tourism. Promoting it as a tourist attraction, Nothomyrmecia has been adopted as the emblem of the Poochera community. Pictures of the ant have been stencilled <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavements,</b> and a large sculpture of Nothomyrmecia has been erected in the town.|$|R

50|$|Puddles {{commonly}} form during rain, and {{can cause}} problems for transport. Due to {{the angle of the}} road, puddles tend to be forced by gravity to gather on the edges of the road.

The museum also displays paintings of local scenes and objects including a clock made by John Bilbie of the Bilbie family, who lived in Axbridge, and a merchants' table known as a [...] "nail", similar to those outside The Exchange in Bristol which were made with a flat top and raised edges to prevent coins from tumbling <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement.</b>|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless the Ritz {{continued}} to be a social hub for the aristocracy and attract the world's elite in the 1950s. It was very popular with the wealthy family of Aga Khan, and oil magnate J. Paul Getty, reputedly the richest man in the world at the time, lived at the Ritz after the war. On one occasion a photographer working for Time and Life magazines staged an incident outside the hotel by arranging for the barrowboy to pour coppers <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> as Getty emerged from the hotel and photographed just as he went to pick them up. Shell Oil heiress Olga Deterding lived at hotel for several years, and in one altercation with her lover she threw his trousers out of the window. In 1956 she tired of the high life and spent a period working on Albert Schweitzer's leper colony in French Equatorial Africa. Film stars Rita Hayworth and Tallulah Bankhead were regular guests at the hotel; Hayworth was married to Prince Aly Khan between 1949 and 1953. Another notable resident of the Ritz during this period was Nubar Gulbenkian, an [...] "expansive extrovert" [...] who kept a permanent suite at the Ritz and made exorbitant demands for luxuries and foods, even if out of season.|$|E

40|$|T]his {{article will}} look at the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s {{definitions}} of “political” activity by § 501 (c) (3) s, other § 501 (c) s, and § 527 s, identifying the many points of congruence and the occasional important differences. We further attempt to explain why the FEC 2 ̆ 7 s detour <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> slippery <b>pavement</b> of tax law led to this crash, and why attempts to follow the tax law 2 ̆ 7 s definitions of political activity will inevitably lead regulatory efforts astray. The legal roads of tax and election law begin from different policy rationales, intersect in seemingly similar concepts, but then proceed to wildly different legal destinations. We conclude with a discussion of why, as a matter of constitutional law, laws that suffice for tax purposes are fatally flawed for election law uses. It is our hope that this analysis will at least steer proponents of campaign finance reform away from another foreseeable crash...|$|R
40|$|Coloured {{pavements}} {{have been}} implemented by metropolitan areas to denote dedicated lanes for bus rapid transit to maintain {{a high level of}} safety. Transit benefits of these installations are well documented. However, field performance of various types of coloured pavement has not been investigated systematically, with questions not being answered. In collaboration with the Regional Municipality of York (ON, Canada) where red pavement sections have been in operation for years for its bus rapid transit lanes, <b>the</b> Centre for <b>Pavement</b> and Transportation Technology at the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, ON, Canada) assessed the performance of various types of red pavements including epoxy paint and red asphalt mixes. It was found that, with significant lower texture depth, epoxy paint surface has disadvantages to red asphalt pavement from a pavement texture and safety perspective. The red asphalt sections in this study were observed as lower yet compatible frictional levels to conventional black pavement. Various types of contamination <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> red <b>pavement</b> were observed during field survey. In addition, the ultraviolet radiation degraded the colour of red asphalt pavement over time and may make it less effective for lane designation.

2500|$|In {{the inner}} London suburbs {{and away from}} town centres, there was no {{disturbance}} by moving traffic to thin out the dense fog in the back streets.
