40|$|Noncircular {{holes on}} the surface of turbine rotor blades are usually {{machined}} <b>by</b> <b>electrodischarge</b> machining. A recast layer containing numerous micropores and microcracks is easily generated during the <b>electrodischarge</b> machining <b>process</b> due to the rapid heating and cooling effects, which restrict the wide applications of noncircular holes in aerospace and aircraft industries. Owing to the outstanding advantages of pulse electrochemical machining, electrodischarge machining–pulse electrochemical machining combined technique is provided to improve the overall quality of electrodischarge machining-drilled holes. The influence of pulse electrochemical machining processing parameters {{on the surface}} roughness and the influence of the electrodischarge machining–pulse electrochemical machining method on the surface quality and accuracy of holes have been studied experimentally. The results indicate that the pulse electrochemical machining processing time for complete removal of the recast layer decreases with the increase in the pulse electrochemical machining current. The low pulse electrochemical machining current results in uneven dissolution of the recast layer, while the higher pulse electrochemical machining current induces relatively homogeneous dissolution. The surface roughness is reduced from 4. 277 to 0. 299 [*]µm, and the hole taper induced <b>by</b> top-down <b>electrodischarge</b> machining <b>process</b> was reduced from 1. 04 ° to 0. 17 ° after pulse electrochemical machining. On account of the advantages of electrodischarge machining and the pulse electrochemical machining, the electrodischarge machining–pulse electrochemical machining combined technique could be applied for machining noncircular holes with high shape accuracy and surface quality...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{models for}} the prediction of failure pressures and leak rates under normal operation and design-basis accident conditions in steam generator tubes with axial and circumferential cracks. These models were first validated through failure and leak rate tests at room temperature and at 282 C on tubes with rectangular, triangular, and trapezoidal notches fabricated <b>by</b> <b>electrodischarge</b> machining. They were then compared with failure and leak rate tests conducted on tubes with laboratory-generated outer-diameter stress corrosion cracks and steam generator tubes with field-induced stress corrosion cracks, which have highly complex morphology. Complex crack profiles are addressed using a model based {{on the concept of}} equivalent rectangular cracks. The predictions of the models are in reasonable agreement with test results, the time-dependent initiation and increase of leak rates observed in some tests cannot be predicted by the model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} a concurrent-engineering view of microsystem design. The proposed concurrent-engineering or mechatronic approach to the design of hybrid microsystems is illustrated by three case studies. First, the design of an advanced computer writing tool is discussed. The design of this consumer product requires a mechatronic approach at different functional levels and at different levels of miniaturization. Another illustration of this approach is the design of an implantable drug delivery device. A device for solid drug delivery, as well as a device for liquid drug delivery, is presented. It is demonstrated that miniaturization can be obtained by a combination of functions in a single component. The multiplication of functions in a single component automatically leads to a concurrent-engineering approach for the design. Finally, the micromanufacturing of silicon parts <b>by</b> <b>electrodischarge</b> machining is described. It is demonstrated that electrodischarge machining of silicon is not only feasible, but forms an interesting and complementary technology to traditional silicon micromachining. Therefore, this powerful manufacturing technique opens the way for concurrent engineering of real three-dimensional micromechanical sensors and actuators with integrated processing electronics on the same wafer. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) report {{deals with}} the {{composition}} development, processing parameter development, microstructural evaluation, and mechanical properties development of the {beta} TiAl alloys. Two series of alloy compositions were identified. The first series consisted of four alloys, and the second series consisted of three alloys. The powders were packed in titanium cans, evacuated, and sealed. The titanium cans were hot extruded at 1150, 1250, and 1400 {degrees}C to an area reduction ratio of 16 : 1. The extruded bars were heat treated between 800 and 1320 {degrees}C, and their microstructure characterized in the extended and heat-treated condition by optical, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microstructural features such as colony size, width of colony boundary {beta} layer, interlamellar spacing, {alpha}{sub 2 }-{alpha}{sub 2 } spacing, {beta}lamellar width, and {alpha}{sub 2 }-{beta} layer ratio were quantified. Tensile bars were prepared from the extruded bars <b>by</b> <b>electrodischarge</b> machining followed <b>by</b> grinding. Tensile tests were conducted from room temperature to 1000 {degrees}C.
