5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of {{the motion of the}} source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the Opticks, {{which was then}} the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, {{at least until the}} development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|In modern quantum physics, the {{electromagnetic}} field {{is described by}} the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED).

In QED, photons are massless particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> vacuum.|$|E

5|$|In the 13th century, Roger Bacon {{argued that}} the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> air was not infinite, using {{philosophical}} arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle.

5|$|It is {{possible}} for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> that medium (but still slower than c).

5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory of light, various concerns continued {{to appear to be}} addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams, passing one through water while the other traveled through air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through air, validating the wave theory of light.|$|E
5|$|The {{houses of}} medieval peasants were of poor quality {{compared}} to modern houses.

In addition to the human inhabitants, a number of livestock animals would also reside in the house. Towards the end of the medieval period, however, conditions generally improved. Peasant houses became larger in size, and it became more common to have two rooms, and even a second floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} light has become {{important}} in high-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower at the {{speed of light}} through glass.|$|E

5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> a medium section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E
