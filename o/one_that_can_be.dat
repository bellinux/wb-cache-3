5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E

25|$|Medically, fatigue is a {{non-specific}} symptom, {{which means}} that it has many possible causes and accompanies many different conditions.

25|$|An amphibolic pathway is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> either catabolic or {{anabolic}} {{based on}} the availability of or the need for energy. The currency of energy in a biological cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which stores its energy in the phosphoanhydride bonds. The energy is utilized to conduct biosynthesis, facilitate movement, and regulate active transport inside of the cell. Examples of amphibolic pathways are the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. These sets of chemical reactions contain both energy producing and utilizing pathways. To the right is an illustration of the amphibolic properties of the TCA cycle.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the Nobel Prize in Physics did not {{recognize}} work done in astronomy. Hubble {{spent much of the}} later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered an area of physics, instead of being its own science. He did this largely so that astronomers—including himself—could be recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics. This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble's lifetime, but shortly after his death, the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize. However, the prize is not <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> awarded posthumously.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} between 'I' and 'me' (nominative and accusative) in object {{position has}} been linked to the social concerns of politeness and elevated language. This non-standard use of the nominative case in object position carries a certain linguistic prestige. People using this form are often perceived as educated and articulate. This variation shows up frequently in newspapers, magazines and political speeches as well as in daily conversation. Conversely, the use of the standard variant 'my wife and me' may seem to signal casualness or lack of sophistication. This illustrates how case marking is not only a system to be followed, but <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used creatively to encode particular social meanings.|$|E

25|$|MOFs {{could be}} {{employed}} {{in each of the}} main three carbon capture configurations for coal-fired power plants: pre-combustion, post-combusiton, and oxy-combustion. However, since the post-combustion configuration is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> retrofitted to existing plants, it garners the most interest and research. In post-combustion carbon capture, the flue gas from the power plant would be fed through a MOF in a packed-bed reactor setup. Flue gas is generally 40 to 60°C with a partial pressure of CO2 at 0.13 - 0.16 bar. The main component CO2 must be separated from is nitrogen, but there are small amounts of other gasses as well. A typical flue gas composition is: 73-77% N2, 15-16% CO2, 5-7% H2O, 3-4% O2, 800 ppm SO2, 10 ppm SO3, 500 ppm NOX, 100 ppm HCl, 20 ppm CO, 10 ppm hydrocarbons, 1ppb Hg.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} an etrog that is stolen or {{withered}} is invalid. If the larger {{part of it}} is covered with scars, or if its nipple is removed, if it is peeled, split, perforated, so that any part is missing, it is invalid. If only its lesser part is covered with scars, if its stalk was missing, or if it is perforated but nothing of it is missing, it is valid. A dark-colored etrog is invalid. If it is green as a leek, Rabbi Meir declares it valid and Rabbi Judah declares it invalid. Rabbi Meir taught that the minimum size of an etrog is that of a nut. Rabbi Judah taught that it is that of an egg. Rabbi Judah taught that the maximum size is such that two can be held in one hand.

The vision presented therein of man torn between the self-centered skepticism of Hamlet and the idealistic generosity of Don Quixote is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said to pervade Turgenev's own works. It is worth noting that Dostoyevsky, who had just returned from exile in Siberia, was present at this speech, for eight years later he was to write The Idiot, a novel whose tragic hero, Prince Myshkin, resembles Don Quixote in many respects. Turgenev, whose knowledge of Spanish, thanks to his contact with Pauline Viardot and her family, was good enough for him to have considered translating Cervantes's novel into Russian, {{played an important role in}} introducing this immortal figure of world literature into the Russian context.|$|E

500|$|The {{zebra shark}} was first {{described}} as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758. No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile.

In 1984, Compagno rejected the name [...] "varius/m" [...] in favor of [...] "fasciatus/m" [...] for the zebra shark, because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions (though Squalus varius is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> construed as a binomial name).
