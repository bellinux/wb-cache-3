40|$|Aims: Modification of {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via ozone {{was carried}} out to enhance removal benzene from aqueous solutions. Materials and Methods: Multi-walled carbon nanotubes purchased from the Iranian Research Institute of the Petroleum Industry was oxidized by ozone generator at % 80 intensity for 5 min and in 30 % NaOCl. Results: The Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that the peaks corresponded to the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups in modified MWCNTs (MMWCNTs) are more intense than that in non-MMWCNTs. The images of scanning electron microscopy indicated that the MMWCNTs have a lower degree of entanglement with increased porosity compared to the nonmodified one. X-ray diffraction test showed that structural crystallization was increased following the modification. After modification, the efficiency of MWCNTs was increased by 20 %. The optimum condition for initial benzene concentration, MWCNT dose, contact time, and pH was: 100 mg/L, 2000 mg/L, 20 min, and 5 respectively. Conclusion: Our research suggested that <b>ozone</b> <b>modification</b> can be a simple method in improvement of the MWCNTs efficiency for removal of benzene from aqueous solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{wettability}} of polyurethane (PU) was altered using ultraviolet ozone (UVO) treatment. The {{effect of}} UVO treatment on PU surface chemistry was investigated with various experiments. The direct measurement of sessile drops {{was employed to}} quantify the static contact angle of different wetting liquids on homogeneous PU films with various UV ozone treatment times. The contact angle of DI water droplets was decreased to 17. 2 º from 70. 04 º after 5 min UVO treatment. The surface free energy of PU films was 51. 46 mN/m prior to treatment and was increased to 71. 5 mN/m after being fully treated. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XP) analysis shows a signifi‐cant amount of polar functional species (C-O and C=O bonding) were formed on the PU surface by UVO treatment. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) characterization shows the PU surface morphology was different before and after UVO treatment. The effect of water washing on UVO treated surface was also investigated. An aging effect study indicates the UV <b>ozone</b> <b>modification</b> can sustain the improved wettability with limited hydrophobic recovery, where the DI water contact angle remains constant at around 22 º after the UVO treatment...|$|E

30|$|The {{dielectric}} barrier discharge (DBD) {{was originally}} proposed by Siemens in 1857 for ‘ozonizing air’, {{which is another}} way of generating non-local thermodynamical equilibrium plasmas even at atmospheric pressure [1, 2]. For over a century, DBDs have been used for a number of industrial applications starting from <b>ozone</b> generation, surface <b>modification,</b> to flat plasma display panels [3, 4]. Efficient excimer formation in DBDs is technically very important for use in high-power ultraviolet lamps. Excimer lamps are mercury-free systems and eco-friendly, and therefore, they are a boom for the lighting industry. In addition, DBDs enable various emerging novel applications in biology and the medical field [5, 6, 7].|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{monitoring}} of atmospheric pollution using chemical gas sensors {{is a challenge}} {{due to the lack}} of selectivity of most existing devices. However, their performances can be improved using filtering films achieving the separation or the removal of some gases. This study is focused on the detection of carbon monoxide and of oxidant pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and ozone) by sensors constituted of SnO 2, or phthalocyanine compounds. Two types of filters were investigated. Filters based on MnO 2 powder are successful to remove ozone while preserving nitrogen dioxide in a large temperature range from ambient to 400 -C, but they partially convert carbon monoxide. The second type of filter constituted of indigo powder is also efficient to remove <b>ozone</b> without <b>modification</b> of nitrogen concentration at ambient. Then, these filters were associated with sensing element. MnO 2 thick films were deposited by screen-printing on SnO 2. With resulting sensors, the interference of ozone for the detection of CO or of NO 2 is reduced, but some technological problems such as adhesion of MnO 2 layer have to be solved. For phthalocyanine devices, the indigo filter placed upstream to the sensitive layer makes the sensor selective to nitrogen dioxide...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{formation}} in trees {{is a dynamic}} process that is strongly affected by environmental factors. However, the impact of ozone on wood is poorly documented. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of ozone on wood formation by focusing on the two major wood components, cellulose and lignin, and analysing any anatomical modifications. Young hybrid poplars (Populus tremula 3 alba) were cultivated under different ozone concentrations (50, 100, 200, and 300 nl l 21). As upright poplars usually develop tension wood in a non-set pattern, the trees were bent in order to induce tension wood formation on the upper side of the stem and normal or opposite wood on the lower side. Biosynthesis of cellulose and lignin (enzymes and RNA levels), together with cambial growth, decreased in response to ozone exposure. The cellulose to lignin ratio was reduced, suggesting that cellulose biosynthesis was more affected than that of lignin. Tension wood was generally more altered than opposite wood, especially at the anatomical level. Tension wood may be more susceptible to reduced carbon allocation to the stems under ozone exposure. These results suggested a coordinated regulation of cellulose and lignin deposition to sustain mechanical strength under <b>ozone.</b> The <b>modifications</b> of the cellulose to lignin ratio and wood anatomy could allow the tree to maintain radial growth while minimizing carbon cost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Anthropogenic {{activities}} {{are changing the}} chemical composition of the global atmosphere, {{as shown by the}} increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and HFC's. In addition, sulphur and nitrogen compounds have. changed the chemical character of precipitation on a regional scale in North America, Europe, and Asia. These changes in turn, alter the physical properties of the atmosphere with responses such as stratospheric ozone depletion, ground level <b>ozone</b> formation and <b>modifications</b> to the radiation balance. Changes in radiation balance are expected to increase the average global temperature. However, local and regional changes in temperatures will be larger and more varied with areas, such as Eastern Canada, having experienced a cooling trend. (Environment Canada 1995) The biosphere is affected by the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere, so we would expect it to respond to these new conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – For {{investigation}} of the vast area of Russia a mobile scientific facility based in a railway carriage was developed. It was equipped with spectrometers for remote sensing of ozone and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere for expeditions along a way from Moscow to Khabarovsk and back performed from February 18 to March 5, 1998 and from March 19 to April 1, 2004. A novel DOAS-type retrieval algorithm, which is applicable to UV observations with strong absorption (by ozone), was developed. It completely takes into account multiple scattering of sunlight. The linearized radiative transfer model MCC++ was used in radiance calculations. Unlike the NO 2 retrieval, account of multiple scattering and albedo is significant for <b>ozone</b> retrieval. A <b>modification</b> of the twilight DOAS method used at the NDSC was applied for retrieval of nitrogen dioxide profiles basing on spectral measurements at visible wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{technology}} has been widely applied in the <b>ozone</b> production, material <b>modification,</b> gas/water cleaning, etc. Various nanomaterials were produced by thermal plasma technology. However, the high temperature process and low uniformity products limit their application for the high value added chemicals synthesis, for example the functional materials or the temperature sensitive materials. Microplasma has attracted significant attentions from various fields owing to its unique characteristics, like the high-pressure operation, non-equilibrium chemistry, continuous-flow, microscale geometry and self-organization phenomenon. Its application on the functional nanomaterial synthesis was elaborately discussed in this review paper. Firstly, the main physical parameters were reviewed, which include the electron temperature, electron energy distribution function, electron density and the gas temperature. Then four representative microplasma configurations were categorized, and the proper selection of configuration was summarized in light of different conditions. Finally the synthesis, mechanism and application of some typical nanomaterials were introduced...|$|R
40|$|Iodine has {{recently}} been of interest in atmospheric chemistry due to its role in tropospheric <b>ozone</b> depletion, <b>modification</b> of the HO/HO 2 ratio and aerosol nucleation. Gas-phase iodine chemistry is tightly coupled to the aerosol phase through heterogeneous reactions, which are dependent on iodine concentrations and speciation in the aerosol. To date, the only method available for total iodine determination in aerosols is collection on filters by impaction and quantification by neutron activation analysis (NAA). NAA is not widely available to all working groups and is costly to commission. Here, we present a method to determine total iodine concentrations in aerosol impact filter samples by combustion of filter sub-samples (~ 5 cm 2) at 1, 000 °C, trapping in deionised water and quantification by UV/Vis spectroscopy. Both quartz and cellulose filters were analysed from four separate sampling campaigns. The method proved to be sensitive (3 s?=? 6 ng absolute iodine?˜? 3 pmol?m- 3) precise (RSD?~? 5 %) and accurate, as determined by external and standard addition calibrations. Total iodine concentrations ranged from 10 pmol?m- 3 over the Southern Ocean to 100 pmol?m- 3 over the tropical Atlantic, in agreement with previous estimates. The soluble iodine concentration (extracted with water and measured by ICP-MS) was then subtracted from the total iodine to yield non-water-soluble iodine (NSI). The NSI fraction ranged from 20 % to 53 % of total iodine, and thus can be significant in some cases...|$|R
40|$|High {{concentration}} of gaseous ozone {{was used to}} treat whey protein isolate (WPI) powder for different times ranging from 30 to 480. min. The aim of the present work was to study the changes in protein structure and evaluate their consequences on selected functional properties. Surface hydrophobicity, free sulphhydryl groups, turbidity, FTIR, SDS-PAGE, HPLC analysis {{are performed to evaluate}} the chemical and structural effects of ozone. The effect of ozonation on the solubility and the foaming properties of proteins are also determined. Results show a reduction of free sulphhydryl groups and an increase of surface hydrophobicity, indicating a self-rearrangement in the protein structure following ozonation. Thus, ozonation allows creation of a more flexible structure without formation of a strong network of disulphide bond or aggregations, which is corroborated by the turbidity analysis and SDS-PAGE. <b>Ozone</b> processing induces <b>modifications</b> that improve the foaming capacity and foam stability, however, a slight reduction in the solubility is encountere...|$|R
40|$|Tomato is {{sensitive}} to ozone. Fruit growth and composition is altered under <b>ozone</b> stress by <b>modification</b> of reproductive development.. Fifty-one-day-old plants were exposed to three concentrations of ozone (200, 350 and 500 [*]µg[*]m(- 3)) for four hours. Ozone reduced well-developed fruit number and fruit size, {{but it did not}} significantly affect flowering rate and fruit setting rate. The effect of ozone depends on organ developmental stage at the time of ozone application, as flowers and young fruits at the time of ozone exposure were more affected. Contents of total soluble sugars (Total SS), total organic acids (Total OA) and ascorbic acid (AsA) increased in fruits harvested from ozone-treated plants. Tomato fruit composition was altered under ozone stress, leading to a lower sugar-acid ratio. These changes were mostly due to increased contents of malic acid, ascorbate, and glucose despite a decrease in sucrose. Acute ozone exposure up to 500 [*]µg[*]m(- 3) greatly influences tomato fruit quality. As final fruit yield was not significantly reduced, it highlighted that there may be compensatory mechanisms present in the reproductive structures of tomato. Further research would be necessary to determine how reproductive traits are affected by repeated ozone exposure or longer term exposur...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} emissions control {{strategies to}} reduce ozone precursor pollutants are analyzed by applying a photochemical modeling system. Simulations of air quality conditions during an ozone episode which occurred in June, 2006 are undertaken by increasing or reducing area source emissions in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. ^ Two air pollutants are primary drivers {{in the formation}} of tropospheric ozone. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) undergo multiple chemical reactions under favorable meteorological conditions to form ozone, which is a secondary pollutant that irritates respiratory systems in sensitive individuals especially the elderly and young children. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to limit ambient air pollutants such as ozone by establishing an 8 -hour average concentration of 0. 075 ppm as the threshold at which a violation of the standard occurs. ^ Ozone forms primarily due reactions in the troposphere of NOx and VOC emissions generated primarily by anthropogenic sources in urban regions. Data from emissions inventories indicate area sources account for ∼ 15 of NOx and ∼ 45 % of regional VOC emissions. Area sources include gasoline stations, automotive paint bodyshops and nonroad mobile sources. Multiplicity of air pollution emissions sources provides an opportunity to investigate and potentially implement air quality improvement strategies to reduce emissions which contribute to elevated ozone concentrations. ^ A baseline modeling scenario was established using the CAMx photochemical air quality model from which a series of sensitivity analyses for evaluating air quality control strategies were conducted. Modifications to area source emissions were made by varying NOx and / or VOC emissions in the areas of particular interest. Model performance was assessed for each sensitivity analysis. Normalized bias (NB) and normalized error (NE) were used to identify variability of the PREDICTED to OBSERVED ozone concentrations of both BASELINE model and simulations with modified emissions assessed by the sensitivity analysis. All simulations were found to vary within acceptable ranges of these two criteria variables. ^ Simulation results indicate ozone formation in the PdN region is VOC-limited. Under VOC-limited conditions, modifications to NOx emissions do not produce a marked increase or decrease in <b>ozone</b> concentrations. <b>Modifications</b> to VOC emissions generated the highest variability in ozone concentrations. Increasing VOC emissions by 75 % produced results which minimized model bias and error when comparing PREDICTED and OBSERVED ozone concentrations. Increasing VOC emissions by 75 % either alone or in combination with a 75 % increase in NOx emissions generated PREDICTED ozone concentrations very near to OBSERVED ozone. ^ By evaluating the changes in ambient ozone concentrations through photochemical modeling, air quality planners may identify the most efficient or effective VOC emissions control strategies for area sources. Among the strategies to achieve emissions reductions are installation of gasoline vapor recovery systems, replacing high-pressure low-volume surface coating paint spray guns with high-volume low-pressure spray paint guns, requiring emissions control booths for surface coating operations as well as undertaking solvent management practices, requiring the sale of low VOC paint solvents in the surface-coating industry, and requiring low-VOC solvents in the dry cleaning industry. Other strategies to reduce VOC emissions include initiating Eco-Driving strategies to reduce fuel consumption from mobile sources and minimize vehicle idling at the international ports of entry by reducing bridge wait times. ^ This dissertation depicts a tool for evaluating impacts of emissions on regional air quality by addressing the highly unresolved fugitive emissions in the Paso del Norte region. It provides a protocol for decision makers to assess the effects of various emission control strategies in the region. Impacts of specific source categories such as the international ports of entry, gasoline stations, paint body shops, truck stops, and military installations on the regional air quality can be easily and systematically addressed in a timely manner in the future. ...|$|R
