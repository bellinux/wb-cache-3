For a moment his attention concentrated on those two enigmatical bundles of dirty clothes and laxly flung limbs, and then his eyes went forward to discover the <b>open</b> <b>hold</b> piled high with trunks and cases, and aft, to where the little cabin gaped inexplicably empty. Then he became aware that the planks of the middle decking were dotted with moving black specks.|$|E

50|$|Grains {{of burning}} powder were hurled about, {{many of them}} {{streaking}} down Mauna Loa’s <b>open</b> <b>hold.</b> Without a moment’s hesitation, Boatswain F. B. Wilson seized a hose and turned it on the burning can. This stream of water checked the fire until Pennsylvania’s men could get the can over the side before it ignited the others. Two of Pennsylvania’s men suffered broken legs and the man handling the powder can was blinded. Courageous performance of their duties under such hazardous conditions had become mere routine to the officers and men of the ammunition ship.|$|E
40|$|Very large {{container}} ships are rather fl exible {{due to the}} large deck openings. Therefore, hydroelastic stress analysis is required {{as a basis for}} a reliable structural design. In the early design stage, the coupling of the beam model with a 3 D hydrodynamic model is rational and preferable. The calculation is performed using the modal superposition method, so natural hull modes have to be determined in a reliable way. Therefore, the advanced thin-walled girder theory, which takes the infl uence of shear on both bending and torsion into account, is applied for calculating the hull fl exural and torsional stiffness properties. A characteristic of very {{large container}} ships is the quite short engine room, whose closed structure behaves as an <b>open</b> <b>hold</b> structure with increased torsional stiffness due to the deck effect. The paper deals with the calculation of its effective torsional stiffness parameters by utilizing the energy balance approach. Also, estimation of distortion of transverse bulkheads, as a result of torsion and warping, is given. The procedure is checked by the 3 D FEM analysis of a ship-like pontoon. Such a modifi ed beam model of the engine room structure can be included in the general beam model of a ship hull for the need of hydroelastic analysis, where only a few fi rst natural frequencies and mode shapes are required. For practical use in the preliminary design stage of ship structures, the simplicity of the beam model presents an advantage over 3 D FEM models...|$|E
