25|$|The Kuwaiti oil {{fires were}} caused by Iraqi {{military}} forces setting fire to a reported 605 to 732 oil wells along with an unspecified number of <b>oil</b> <b>filled</b> low-lying areas, such as oil lakes and fire trenches, {{as part of a}} scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 due to the advances of Coalition military forces in the Persian Gulf War. The fires were started in January and February 1991, and the first well fires were extinguished in early April 1991, with the last well capped on November 6, 1991.|$|E

[...] Estimates placed the number of oil well fires from 605 to 732. A further thirty-four wells had been destroyed by heavy coalition bombing in January.

Therefore, the source kitchen/bed for the Ordovician reservoir of the Tuoputai region is predicted to be to {{the south side of the}} study area, most likely in the Shuntuoguole Uplift, which lies between the Awati and Manjiaer Depressions (Fig.Â  1). The location of the source kitchen/bed is in agreement with the findings of previous studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Fang et al. 2016).|$|R
2500|$|... {{is used in}} the {{electrical}} industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment, often replacing <b>oil</b> <b>filled</b> circuit breakers (OCBs) that can contain harmful PCBs. [...] gas under pressure is used as an insulator in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) because it has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen. The high dielectric strength {{is a result of the}} gas's high electronegativity and density. This property makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air-insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room. Gas-insulated electrical gear is also more resistant to the effects of pollution and climate, as well as being more reliable in long-term operation because of its controlled operating environment.

30|$|The Markit Slope is an {{important}} area for the petroleum exploration in the Tarim Basin. Elucidation of the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> history of discovered oilfields has great significance for recognizing the accumulation processes of the whole region. Using molecular geochemistry, fluid inclusion techniques and basin modeling, we studied the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> process of the Bashituo Oilfield that {{is located in the}} west of the Markit Slope. The molecular migration indexes, such as the methyldibenzothiophene ratio (4 -/ 1 -MDBT), trimethylnaphthalene ratio (TMNr) and pyrrolic nitrogen compounds content, decrease from west to east, indicating that the charging direction and migration pathways are from west to east. Lithological analysis and homogenization temperatures of saline fluid inclusions accompanied with oil fluid inclusions suggest that two charging periods occurred in the Devonian oil reservoir. Combining the burial history and heating history of well BT 4, Basinmod ID software modeling shows the two <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> periods are from 290 Ma to 285 Ma and from 10 Ma to 4 Ma, respectively, and later <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> dominates. This study may be helpful to understand the accumulation process and provide useful references for oil and gas exploration in the Markit Slope.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the research in}} the area of the application of diagnostic methods for assessment of the state of <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> in cycloid gearbox of robotic manipulator. The experiments were realized on request of the manufacturer of the cycloid gearbox. Primarily, the two different methods were compared: an induction, magnetic method with the use of measurement system Cosmos-Steel Dust Checker and an RTG method, XRF (X-ray fluorescent method, analyses with use of X-ray radiation). These analytical methods provide the identification and quantification of emerging Fe abrasion particles occurring in the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> of the redactor. The results of the experiment pointed to the unsuitability of the application of the induction magnetic method for the assessment of an actual technical state of the cycloid gearbox. The reason for this lies in specific construction of the cycloid gearbox, with characteristic high operation temperatures of the <b>oil</b> <b>filling,</b> small dimensions, high transferred power, and gear ratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} road vehicle with hydrodynamic brakes on road slopes, containing disturbances such as the variable load and {{the angle of the}} slope, is presented. The input is the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> and the output is the vehicle velocity. A {{mathematical model}} of the filling sump controlled by the proportional spool valve is developed. Using different geometry of the valve output port, the optional geometry is defined so that the pressure response in the chamber are sufficiently linear and quick. The effects of the nonlinear flow through the valve and the air compressibility in the chamber were carefully considered. Finally, a model connecting the control signal in the control unit of the hydrodynamic brake with the pressure in the sump, i. e. with the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> in the working space of the brake, is developed, thus completing the modelling and simulation process. The braking torque depends on the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> and the number of revolution of the brake rotor. The mathematical models of both the vehicle and the brake are nonlinear, but the analysis is carried out using linear equations valid in corresponding areas limited with nominal values of the model parameters...|$|R
