5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species.

Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> epithet in lowercase.

A passage from Sebeos's History has been understood to suggest an Arsacid origin of Heraclius the Elder. This theory was strongly supported by Cyril Toumanoff, while considered likely by Alexander Vasiliev and Irfan Shahîd. John of Nikiû and Constantine Manasses seem to consider his son, Heraclius the Younger, to be a Cappadocian, which might indicate his place of birth rather than actual ancestry.|$|E

Kalākaua's autocracy and nativism, along with allegations of his corruption, convinced a powerful group of western businessmen and children of Christian missionaries that action should be taken against the king. This led to the June 1887 Constitution, which stripped Kalākaua of much of his power and significantly weakened the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues parrot was scientifically {{described}} and named as Psittacus rodricanus in 1867 by the French ornithologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards, {{based on a}} subfossil partial beak.

Milne-Edwards corrected the spelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> name to rodericanus in 1873 (in a compilation of his articles about extinct birds), a spelling which {{was used in the}} literature henceforward, but it was changed back to rodricanus by the IOC World Bird List in 2014. Milne-Edwards moved the species to its own genus Necropsittacus in 1874; the name is derived from the Greek words necros, which means dead, and psittakos, parrot, in reference to the bird being extinct.|$|E

5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game.

5|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf {{argued that it was}} exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic on the Wii and DS is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players can assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character while competing against the others in these events. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a paddle. The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games closely follow rules and regulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting a sporting spirit and its desire to interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters. Due to this atmosphere of competitive sportsmanship, Sega received approval by Nintendo to include Mario in the game with Sonic.

5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend on the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium) {{that give rise to}} magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
5|$|Spongiforma is a genus of sponge-like {{fungi in}} the Boletaceae family. Newly {{described}} in 2009, the genus contains two species: S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii. The type species S.thailandica is known only from Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests dominated by dipterocarp trees. The rubbery fruit bodies, {{which has a}} strong odour of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. S.squarepantsii, described as new to science in 2011, is found in Malaysia. It produces sponge-like, rubbery orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky odour. These fruit bodies will—like a sponge—resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> name derives from its perceived resemblance to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. Apart from differences in distribution, S.squarepantsii differs from S.thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure.|$|E
