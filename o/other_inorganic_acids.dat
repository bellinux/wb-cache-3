40|$|The {{most common}} {{renewable}} fuel is ethanol. It is a liquid produced by fermentation of glucose {{which is very}} abundant in cellulose based materials. Bioethanol is achieved in a two-steps process: 1. hydrolysis of the cellulose included in the ligno-cellulosic materials to fermentable reducing sugars; 2. fermentation of such sugars to ethanol. While the second fermentation step, mediated by yeasts or bacteria, is very well established, the first one must be still assessed for process optimization. Many efforts {{have been made to}} identify solvents for cellulose in order to develop methods for the achievement of fermentable glucose. In the presence of mineral acid, cellulose undergoes hydrolysis whose extent depends on acid concentration, reaction temperature and duration of treatment. In the last years, dissolution in phosphoric acid (a weak mineral acid, non toxic and safer to use as compared to <b>other</b> <b>inorganic</b> <b>acids)</b> has been increasingly considered as a simple and economic method for cellulose pretreatment before its degradation to glucose.

40|$|Protonated {{titanate}} nanotube (PINT) {{was first}} reported {{as a good}} catalyst for the hydroxyalkylation/alkylation (HAA) of 2 -methylfuran (2 -MF) and n-butanal from lignocellulose. Compared with <b>other</b> <b>inorganic</b> solid <b>acids,</b> PTNT has higher catalytic activity and efficiency. Over it, high yield of HAA product (77 %) was achieved under mild reaction conditions. PTNT is also effective for the HAA (or alkylation) reactions between 2 -MF and other lignocellulosic carbonyl compounds. According to the characterization results, the hydrothermal treatment of TiO 2 P 25 with NaOH solution and subsequent acidification significantly increases its BET surface area {{and the amount of}} acid sites on the surface of catalyst. Moreover, these pretreatments also lead to the generation of strong acid sites and Bronsted acid sites on the surface of catalyst. All of these changes are responsible for the excellent performance of PTNT. As the final aim of this work, the HAA product of 2 -MF and n-butanal was converted to diesel and jet fuel range brached alkanes by the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over zeolite loaded Ni catalysts. Among them, Ni/H-ZSM- 5 demonstrated the best catalytic performance and good stability, which makes it a promising catalyst in future application. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to study the {{salvation}} effects of metal-crown ether complexation in different solvents. It has been suggested in the literature that supercritical fluid carbon dioxide (SF-CO 2) is a tunable solvent because its salvation environment can be varied with the fluid density. In this project, spectroscopic techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) were used to evaluate salvation effects of metal crown complexation in organic solvents and in SF-CO 2. In most solvent extraction systems, water is often involved in the extraction processes. We have carried out extensive studies of water-crown ether interactions in different solvents and in SF-CO 2 using NMR and FTIR techniques. Water molecules can be attached to crown ethers through hydrogen bonding of H- 0 -H to the oxygen atoms of crown ether cavities. This type of interaction is like a Lewis acid-Lewis base complexation. During {{the course of this}} project, we noticed that some CO 2 soluble Lewis base such as tri-n-butyl-phosphate (TBP) can also form such Lewis acid-Lewis base complexes with water and <b>other</b> <b>inorganic</b> <b>acids</b> including nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Inorganic acids (e. g. nitric acid) are normally not soluble in SF-CO 2. However, because TBP is highly soluble in SF-CO 2, an inorganic acid bound to TBP via hydrogen bonding becomes CO 2 soluble. This Lewis acid-Lewis base complex approach provides a method of introducing inorganic acids into supercritical fluid CO 2 for chemical reactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{report of}} several years ago (2) on the {{production}} and purification of "flavicin " included a partial characterization of an organic acid (m. p. 67 - 68 °) isolated {{from one of the}} toxic fractions of very low antibiotic activity. This acid possessed one free acidic group and one apparently bound acidic group. Elementary analyses were subsequently obtained which indicated the simplest empirical formula to be CsHs-eNO^ Recently we returned to the consideration of a structure for this interest ing acid. That the substance might be / 3 -nitropropionic acid was suggested by the report (3) that this nitro compound is identical with hiptagenic acid, obtained by hydrolysis of two closely related plant glycosides, hiptagin (4, 5) and karakin (5, 6). Apparently the only other known nitro com pound of biological origin is chloramphenicol (7, 8). /?-Nitropropionic acid was synthesized from / 3 -propiolactone and sodium nitrite and from / 3 -iodopropionic acid and silver nitrite, and the identity of the natural and synthetic products was established by several independent criteria, including the slow neutralization in the alkaline range characteristic of primary aliphatic nitro groups and their salts (9). The nitro compound could not be isolated from the corn steep liquor or from sterilized medium before inoculation, but it was possible to repeat the isolation of / 3 -nitro propionic acid from culture liquor. These results indicate that the sub stance is indeed a metabolic product of the microorganism.

40|$|Abstract. Total {{alkalinity}} (TAlk) {{has long}} been used to eval-uate the buffering capacity of aquatic systems. TAlk has also been used, together with measurements of either pH or dis-solved inorganic carbon (DIC), to indirectly estimate the par-tial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in inland waters, estu-aries, and marine systems. These estimates typically assume that carbonate and bicarbonate ions comprise nearly all the species contributing to TAlk; however, <b>other</b> <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>acids</b> {{have the potential to}} contribute significant non-carbonate alkalinity. To evaluate the potential for error in using TAlk to estimate pCO 2, we measured pH, TAlk, and DIC in samples of river water. Estimates of pCO 2 derived from TAlk and pH measurements were higher than pCO 2 es-timates derived from DIC and pH by 13 – 66 %. We infer that this overestimate is due to the presence of significant non-carbonate alkalinity (NC-Alk). This study also describes the relative proportions of carbonate- and non-carbonate alkalin-ity measured in 15 river systems located in northern New England (USA) and New Brunswick (Canada). NC-Alk rep-resents a significant buffering component in these river sys-tems (21 –∼ 100 % of TAlk), and failure to account for NC-Alk (which cannot directly contribute to pCO 2) leads to the overestimation of carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere. ...|$|R

40|$|Hydrofluoric acid is a water {{solution}} of hydrogen fluoride (HF). Hydrofluoric acid is used widely in diverse types of industrial applications; traditionally, {{it is used}} in pickling solutions in the metal industry, in the fabrication of chlorofluorocarbon compounds, as an alkylation agent for gasoline and as an etching agent in the industry of glass. In recent years, hydrofluoric acid has extensively {{been used in the}} manufacture of semiconductors and microelectronics during the wet chemical cleaning of silicon wafers. Hydrofluoric acid can be considered a reducing acid and although it is chemically classified as weaker than, for example, sulfuric or hydrochloric acids, it is extremely corrosive. This acid is also particularly toxic and poses greater health hazard than most other acids. The corrosion behavior of metals in hydrofluoric acid has not been as systematic studied in the laboratory as for <b>other</b> common <b>inorganic</b> <b>acids.</b> This is largely because tests using hydrofluoric acid cannot be run in standard equipment and because of the toxic nature of this acid. Moreover, short-term weight loss laboratory corrosion tests in hydrofluoric acid can be frustrating since the results are not as highly reproducible {{as in the case of}} other acids such as sulfuric or hydrochloric. One of the reasons is because hydrofluoric acid commonly attacks the coupons used for testing in a non-uniform manner. That is, the corrosive power of this acid is not aimed to uniform thinning but mostly to localized penetration below the skin of the metal in the form of thin cracks, voids, pits, trenches and sometimes intergranular attack. Figure 1 shows the cross section of a coupon of Alloy 600 (N 06600) exposed for 336 h to the vapor phase of a {{solution of}} 20 % HF at 93 C.

40|$|Removal of an <b>inorganic</b> <b>acid</b> load in {{subjects}} with ketoacidosis of chronic fasting. When a large <b>inorganic</b> <b>acid</b> load is ingested by normals, the proton load is eliminated because the rate of excretion of ammonium can rise to 200 to 300 mmol/day. In subjects with ketoacidosis of chronic fasting, such a large increase {{in the rate of}} excretion of ammonium might not be possible because of ATP balance considerations in proximal cells. Subjects with ketoacidosis of chronic fasting excreted less net acid as defined in the conventional way when they consumed a large <b>inorganic</b> <b>acid</b> load (136 ± 6 vs. 176 ± 26 mmol/day in control fasted subjects). Nevertheless, the vast majority of this <b>inorganic</b> <b>acid</b> load was eliminated because they were in steady state and had only a slightly lower concentration of bicarbonate (13 ± 0. 6 vs. 15 ± 0. 5 mmol/liter) and ketoacid anions (3. 3 ± 0. 2 vs. 5. 5 ± 0. 2 mmol/liter) in their blood. Using a definition of net acid excretion where the component of bicarbonate loss was expanded to include “potential bicarbonate” (ketoacid anions) in the urine, the rate of excretion of net acid was higher {{in subjects}} who ingested the <b>inorganic</b> <b>acid</b> load, owing to a much lower rate of excretion of ketoacid anions (9 ± 2 vs. 120 ± 7 mmol/day). This lower rate of excretion was not only due to a lower filtered load, but also to a higher fractional reabsorption of ketoacid anions during acidosis (97 ± 0. 1 vs. 77 ± 0. 2 %). This higher fractional reabsorption could not be explained by a lower filtered load of ketoacid anions or to a restricted intake of sodium. We conclude that an enhanced rate of reabsorption leads to a reduced rate of excretion of “potential bicarbonate” in the urine, and {{this is part of the}} response to eliminate an <b>inorganic</b> <b>acid</b> load during chronic ketoacidosis...|$|R
