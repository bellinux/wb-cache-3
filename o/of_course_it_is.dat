5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

25|$|Habeas corpus {{has certain}} limitations. Though a writ of right, {{it is not}} a writ <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{technically}} only a procedural remedy; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then habeas corpus may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or state of emergency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{possible}} to code {{more than two}} symbols in any given medium. For example, one might use respectively 0, 1, 2, and 3 volts to code a four-symbol alphabet on a wire, or holes of different sizes in a punched card. In practice, the tight constraints of high speed, small size, and low power combine to make noise a major factor. This {{makes it hard to}} distinguish between symbols when there are several possible symbols that could occur at a single site. Rather than attempting to distinguish between four voltages on one wire, digital designers have settled on two voltages per wire, high and low.|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E

500|$|After Ferrari's {{victory at}} the {{previous}} race, their team principal Jean Todt, said that [...] "we {{seemed to be in}} a strong position but, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the order at the finish that counts", while Michael Schumacher said that his car's tyres dropped in performance after taking his first pit stop. McLaren technical director Adrian Newey said that the pit stop strategy was crucial in winning the race: [...] "The tyre wear did not spring any surprises on us {{and we were able to}} trust our estimations and co-ordinate the pit-stops to our best advantage." [...] Villeneuve was happy with his strong finish and was surprised by his good start. Heidfeld, who made contact with his teammate Alesi during the race, apologised for the collision. Ralf Schumacher said that he reduced his pace to secure his fifth position. Trulli described his race as [...] "difficult" [...] because of the hot temperatures though he praised his mechanics for their work.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{carried the}} unusual credit of [...] "Sebastian Faulks writing as Ian Fleming" [...] and Faulks {{described}} how—using Fleming's article—he had employed the same style as Fleming {{did in his}} novels: [...] "it's standard journalistic: no semicolons, few adverbs, few adjectives, short sentences, a lot of verbs, a lot of concrete nouns. These are the tools, and that's literally the style." [...] Faulks also commented that [...] "some people find it perplexing but I think {{the way that the}} book has been presented... is a clever way of showing that it is not my book, although, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my book." [...] A large part of Devil May Care is set in Persia (now Iran); it was an area Fleming had not previously dealt with in his Bond novels, describing it as [...] "full of thieves and crooks". Faulks said of his choice of location that Fleming [...] "didn't set any of his books there, which is surprising in some ways because Lebanon in the 60s would have made a great setting for a Bond story. But his loss is my gain.".|$|E
500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E

Sarnia has underground salt formations like those at Fort Saskatchewan. Caverns washed into those formations were used to receive NGL from IPL, and to store specification grade products to meet seasonal demand.|$|E
