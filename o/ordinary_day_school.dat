5000|$|Binney {{was born}} of Presbyterian parents at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1798, and educated at an <b>ordinary</b> <b>day</b> <b>school.</b> He spent his first seven years in the {{employment}} of a G Angus, bookseller and printer of The Side, Newcastle, where he had as a fellow apprentice, Robert Emery. It was during this period that Emery wrote his song about [...] "The Great Frost on the River Tyne" [...] which caused the river to freeze over during January and February 1814. Binney is credited by Thomas Allan, in his Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings with finishing off the song. After his time with the bookseller, he entered the theological school at Wymondley, Hertfordshire, later incorporated in New College, Hampstead.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{forms an}} {{exploratory}} study {{the purpose of}} which is to clarify the nature of relationships existing between the social and emotional adjustment of physically handicapped children and the type of school attended. The subjects, 114 children of from nine to eleven years of age, of normal intelligence and with visible physical handicaps affecting movement, were drawn from three types of school: (a) ordinary day, (b) special day, and (c) special residential. A matched sample of 114 normal children attending both ordinary and residential schools formed the control groups. The children were interviewed individually ana various psychological tests administered, i. e. verbal and non-verbal, intelligence, school attainment, adjustment and personality characteristics, attitudes to school and child-family relationships. The teachers estimated social adjustments in children while the parents' attitudes to child-rearing and the attitudes of normal children in ordinary schools to the physically handicapped were also examined. The results obtained show interesting trends. There were no statistically significant differences in the overall social and emotional adjustment of physically handicapped children at the three types of school. Physically handicapped children at ordinary day schools had higher educational attainments than had children at special schools. Differences were not found between the social and emotional adjustment of physically handicapped children and their controls. However, only the physically handicapped attending ordinary day schools achieved the same educationallevel as did the controls. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that neither integration nor segregation is superior in ensuring the optimal psychological development of physically handicapped children. On the other hand, at the present time and bearing in mind the limitations of this study, the <b>ordinary</b> <b>day</b> <b>school</b> seems to be more successful in promoting the higher level of scholastic achievement. Accordingly, it is suggested that there should be increased integration between the physically handicapped and the normal. The provisions essential for such integration are outlined. It is advised that special schools should be retained in modified form. The modifications necessary to promote optimum personal and educational development are discussed...|$|E

To observe the effects of twosuch activities (listening to a text and performing a dictation) on affective state, according to grade, we asked 39 third graders and 40 fifth graders to specify their affective state at several points in the day. Results showed thatthis state varied from one activity to another, and was also dependent on grade level. Third graders differed fromfifth graders in the feelings elicited by the activities. The possible implications of these findings for the field ofeducational psychology and children’s academic performance are discussed...|$|R

Unknown to normal humans, angels (Tenshi), fallen angels (Datenshi) and devils (Akuma) comprise part of the student population. One of these students, Issei Hyodo, is a lecherous second-year human student who lives a peaceful life.

Issei wakes up the next morning, thinking that the events that occurred were all just a dream. Immediately after being attacked by another fallen angel and waking up, he notices Rias naked in his room. Rias reveals to Issei her true identity as a devil and says {{that as a result of}} his death at the hands of Yuma, she has reincarnated him as a devil, becoming his new master in the process.|$|R
