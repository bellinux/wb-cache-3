25|$|In {{the case}} of bi-objective problems, informing the {{decision}} maker concerning the Pareto front is usually carried out by its visualization: the Pareto front, often named the tradeoff curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane. The tradeoff curve gives full information on <b>objective</b> <b>values</b> and on objective tradeoffs, which inform how improving one objective is related to deteriorating the second one while moving along the tradeoff curve. The decision maker takes this information into account while specifying the preferred Pareto optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the Pareto front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty. This idea was developed and applied in environmental problems by J.L. Cohon. A review of methods for approximating the Pareto front for various decision problems with {{a small number of}} objectives (mainly, two) is provided in.|$|E
25|$|For a nontrivial multi-objective {{optimization}} problem, {{no single}} solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective. In that case, the objective functions {{are said to}} be conflicting, and there exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions. A solution is called nondominated, Pareto optimal, Pareto efficient or noninferior, if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other <b>objective</b> <b>values.</b> Without additional subjective preference information, all Pareto optimal solutions are considered equally good (as vectors cannot be ordered completely). Researchers study multi-objective optimization problems from different viewpoints and, thus, there exist different solution philosophies and goals when setting and solving them. The goal may be to find a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions, and/or quantify the trade-offs in satisfying the different objectives, and/or finding a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences of a human decision maker (DM).|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be shown that if an extreme point is not a maximum point of the {{objective}} function then there is an edge containing the point so that the objective function is strictly increasing on the edge {{moving away from the}} point. If the edge is finite then the edge connects to another extreme point where the objective function has a greater value, otherwise the objective function is unbounded above on the edge and the linear program has no solution. The simplex algorithm applies this insight by walking along edges of the polytope to extreme points with greater and greater <b>objective</b> <b>values.</b> This continues until the maximum value is reached or an unbounded edge is visited, concluding that the problem has no solution. The algorithm always terminates because the number of vertices in the polytope is finite; moreover since we jump between vertices always in the same direction (that of the objective function), we hope that the number of vertices visited will be small.|$|E

We show how graph partitioning {{can be used}} to increase the speed of planning optimum routes. Creating a graph partition with future route planning in mind leads to a non-standard graph partitioning problem. In particular, the quality of a partition, indicated by the <b>objective</b> <b>value,</b> is assumed to represent the execution time of the route planning process. We present an efficient approximation algorithm for creating graph partitions suited for fast optimum route planning. We study the relation between the <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> and the number of edges evaluated by the route planning algorithm, which is an objective measure of the route planning speed. Experiments show that the best partition according to the <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> does not lead to the fastest route planning process. We present a new <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> and show that better partitions result in faster route planning for our new <b>objective</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R

We consider the stochastic variant of this problem in which the processing times are exponentially distributed random variables. We discuss the phenomenon of deliberate idleness. For some cases we prove that optimal policies are idle time free, but the general question remains unanswered. We extensively study the WSEPT list scheduling policy, and show that its perfomance guarantee is not better than 1. 243. This constitutes the first lower bound for WSEPT in this setting.

40|$|Transportation models play an {{important}} role in logistics and supply chain management for reducing cost and improving service. This paper develops a procedure to derive the fuzzy <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> of the fuzzy transportation problem, in that the cost coefficients and the supply and demand quantities are fuzzy numbers. The idea is based on the extension principle. A pair of mathematical programs is formulated to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the fuzzy total transportation cost at possibility level a. From different values of a, the membership function of the <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> is constructed. Two different types of the fuzzy transportation problem are discussed: one with inequality constraints and the other with equality constraints. It is found that the membership function of the <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> of the equality problem is contained in that of the inequality problem. Since the <b>objective</b> <b>value</b> is expressed by a membership function rather than by a crisp value, more information is provided for making decisions. Ó 2002 Elsevier B. V.
