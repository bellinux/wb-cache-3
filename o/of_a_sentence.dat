On August 27, 1954, he was named auxiliary bishop of Antioch; then, on September 2, 1954, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Nubia.

5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.)</b> Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857 the Beetons had {{considered}} using the magazine columns {{as the basis}} of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> or recipe is split between the end of one instalment {{and the beginning of the}} next.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{included a}} scripting team, who inserted pre-programmed scripts into the dialogue, a process {{referred to as}} scripting: these scripts {{could be used to}} change characters' animations, stop the text in the middle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> automatically proceed to the next text box, and pan the camera. The staff had to envision how scenes would look, and used these scripts to create a flow of character animations and add dramatic tension, such as adding a pause after a character sighs to increase the dramatic effect.|$|E

50|$|Valency {{refers to}} the number <b>of</b> {{participants}} that <b>a</b> verb takes. In Wayana, the subject <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intransitive <b>sentence</b> (S) is distinguished from subject <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitive <b>sentence</b> (<b>A)</b> and the object <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transitive <b>sentence</b> (O). The valency on a verb stem can be decreased or increased by using certain affixes. Valence can be decreased by only one affix - the detransitivizing prefix - but can be increased by four different suffixes. Causational morphemes (such as the Wayana -po) are not considered as valence-increasing, since the participants they introduce are optional.|$|R
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> of imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E
