However, there still exists {{a perception of}} radical otherness, of an existential threat {{at the heart of}} the political community. The debates in the German and the French Parliaments about security, terrorism and extremism since the end of the 1960 s support this fact. This doctoral thesis aims to explore this phenomenon with the tools of political theory and suggest the necessity of overcoming the paradox. Far from being a cause for concern, the concept of enmity is essential to understand democratic identity.

60|$|Anybody could {{pulverise}} the Irish {{church in}} argument, {{and to show}} that it ought to be disestablished and disendowed was the easiest thing in the world. But as often happens, what it was easy to show ought to be done, was extremely hard to do. Here Mr. Gladstone was in his great element. It was true to say that “never were the wheels of legislative machinery set in motion under conditions of peace and order and constitutional regularity to deal with a question greater or more profound,” than when the historic protestant church in Ireland was severed from its sister church in England and from its ancient connection with the state. The case had been fully examined in parliament. After examination and decision there, it was discussed and decided in the constituencies of the United Kingdom. Even then many held that the operation was too gigantic in its bearings, too complex in the mass of its detail, to be practicable. Never was <b>our</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> more severely tested, and never did it achieve a completer victory. Every great organ of the national constitution came into active play. The sovereign performed a high and useful duty. The Lords fought hard, but yielded before the strain reached a point of danger. The prelates in the midst of anger and perturbation were forced round to statesmanship. The Commons stood firm and unbroken. The law, when at length it became law, effected the national purpose with extraordinary thoroughness and precision. And the enterprise was inspired, guided, propelled, perfected, and made possible from its inception to its close by the resource, temper, and incomparable legislative skill of Mr. Gladstone. That the removal of the giant abuse of protestant establishment in Ireland made a deeper mark on national well-being than other of his legislative exploits, we can hardly think, but—quite apart from the policy of the act, as to which there can now be scarcely two opinions—as a monument of difficulties surmounted, prejudices and violent or sullen heats overcome, rights and interests adjusted, I know not where in the records of our legislation to find its master.|$|E
60|$|The policy {{appears to}} me {{to be the result of}} {{profound}} reflection; or rather the happy effect of following nature, which is wisdom without reflection, and above it. A spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper, and confined views. People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward to their ancestors. Besides, the people of England well know that the idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle of conservation, and a sure principle of transmission, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acquisition free; but it secures what it acquires. Whatever advantages are obtained by a state proceeding on these maxims, are locked fast as in a sort of family settlement; grasped as in a kind of mortmain for ever. By a constitutional policy working after the pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we transmit our government and our privileges, in the same manner in which we enjoy and transmit our property and our lives. The institutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of Providence, are handed down to us, and from us, in the same course and order. <b>Our</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the order of the world, and with the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle-aged, or young, but, in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression. Thus, by preserving the method of nature in the conduct of the state, in what we improve, we are never wholly new; in what we retain, we are never wholly obsolete. By adhering in this manner and on those principles to our forefathers, we are guided not by the superstition of antiquarians, but by the spirit of philosophic analogy. In this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood; binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic ties; adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family affections; keeping inseparable, and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our state, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our altars.|$|E

40|$|Rather than a {{new feature}} of modern {{industrial}} society, we argue that the much-discussed problem of "risk " represents only a modern conceptual language for discussing the age-old problems of uncertainty and control. What is different about the worries of the present day is not the number of hazards we face or the degree of uncertainty we feel about our lives, but rather it is the language we use to think and talk about them, a language that, in keeping with our time, is highly rationalistic. This rationalism is problematic because it can easily become rationalization. Risk explains uncertainty, and it also explains it away. It gives control and it takes control, and therefore we often feel trapped in an iron cage of risk. We critique that iron cage on several grounds. First, we offer {{a critique of the}} rationalization of risk assessment. Second, we critique the risk communication literature and its rationalizations.
