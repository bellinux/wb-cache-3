These Mataboos are a privileged order, so important is their avocation, and they make the most of their high functions. A long way out of the Tonga Islands, indeed, rather near the British Islands, was there no calling in of the Mataboos the other day to settle an earth-convulsing question of precedence; and was there no weighty <b>opinion</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>on</b> the part of the Mataboos which, being interpreted to that unlucky tribe of blacks with the sense of the ridiculous, would infallibly set the whole population screaming with laughter? ...|$|E
50|$|After a {{landslide}} election victory, Johnson used his State of the Union address in January 1965 to, among other things, promise a voting rights act. It was Cox {{who developed the}} first draft. The mechanism devised by Cox was to provide for a presumption of illegality of a list of practices including literacy tests and similar devices if the state {{had a history of}} low minority voter turn-out as shown by voter statistics. In such cases the burden was shifted to the state to prove nondiscriminatory intent. This mechanism remained the heart of the legislation throughout the legislative process. Both Ramsey Clark and Nicholas Katzenbach admired the mechanism for its legal craftsmanship and statecraft (because it avoided the need to prove intent to discriminate). Before the bill was submitted to Congress Cox answered a question in Court which was used by nationally syndicated columnist Drew Pearson to embarrass Cox before the new president. On January 28, Cox urged the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision which held that the federal government had no power to sue a state alleging violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by discriminatory devices aimed at African-Americans. Cox argued the narrow ground that the government had such power. When the Court expressly asked Cox whether he was asking the Court to strike down the statutes, Cox answered that he was not, only that the case be remanded to the three-court panel. The Court's <b>opinion,</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>on</b> March 8, highlighted this exchange {{in such a way that}} some inferred that Cox passed up a golden opportunity. Pearson's column stated that Cox had cost the civil rights movement two years in litigation, and for that he point blank suggested that Johnson replace Cox as solicitor general.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes a {{critical}} look at the conclusions and reasoning of the Opinion of the Advocate General in the case C- 270 / 12 UK v Council and Parliament that, {{at the time of}} writing this paper, is pending before the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union. In his <b>Opinion</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>on</b> 12 September 2013, Advocate General Jääskinen found, in agreement with the UK, that the Article 114 TFEU was not an appropriate legal basis for the powers granted to the European Securities Markets Authority under Article 28 of the Regulation 236 / 2012 on Short Selling and certain aspects of Credit Default Swaps. This paper has three aims: first, to underline the “systemic” importance of the case for the nascent system of EU financial supervision; second, to point out certain neglected dimensions in the Opinion, especially the insufficient attention paid to ex ante (political and procedural) safeguards and the problematic relationship between financial stability and financial integration; and third, to emphasise the need of the Court to find a second-best solution in order to ring-fence the damage that could be caused to the supervisory system in the event the Court were to agree with the Advocate General’s findings. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP/ 2007 – 2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n.

40|$|Pursuant to Title 35, § 101 of the United States Code, {{anyone who}} 2 ̆ 2 invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or {{composition}} of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof 2 ̆ 2 {{is eligible for}} a patent. Traditionally, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the federal courts have enumerated a variety of tests for determining patent eligibility, but common language in the case law had lead to, in Bilski v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. 3218 (2010), the development {{of what is known}} as the machine-or-transformation test. In an <b>opinion</b> <b>delivered</b> <b>on</b> the final day of the 2009 - 2010 session, the U. S. Supreme Court concluded that while the machine-or-transformation test is a useful tool, it is not the only test for determining an invention 2 ̆ 7 s patent eligibility. This opinion preserved thousands of patents worldwide and prevented enormous emotional distress and financial hardship for inventors who had bet the proverbial house on their innovations. However, the ruling also had the unfortunate side effect of undermining two decades of patentability precedent which followed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test for determining an invention 2 ̆ 7 s patent eligibility, thus leaving inventors and patent professionals without clear direction. This note argues that while the Supreme Court seemed to turn the patent world upside down in the Bilski decision, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to adopt a rigid rule for determining patent eligibility under § 101 correctly embraced a broad construction of § 101. Broad interpretation of § 101 is appropriate because it is simply a threshold inquiry, and claims must also meet the requirements of §§ 102, 103, and 112 before a patent is issued. Further, by finding that the machine-or-transformation test is a relevant factor but not the sole consideration, the Supreme Court preserved billions of dollars of patented property because alternate tests for determining patentability still provide valuable insight into the decision of whether to issue a patent. Although the Bilski decision does promote uncertainty in how to draft patent claims, such uncertainty is outweighed by the resulting standard which is flexible enough to adapt to new technologies...|$|E

The Committee was asked whether: 1. “In case of adoption of derogations to EC regulation n. 727 / 2007, the risk of consumers’ exposure to the Pathological Prion Protein (PrPSC) may be considered as acceptable. 2. “If consumers run an acceptable risk of contracting a disease following consumption of sheep and goat meat coming from susceptible animals and TSE outbreaks”. After a careful assessment, which also took into consideration the <b>opinion</b> <b>delivered</b> by EFSA <b>on</b> this issue, as well as the <b>opinion</b> <b>delivered</b> by the National Health Institute and the National Reference Centre for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopahties (Turin IZS), the CNSA considered that in case the derogations laid down by EC 727 / 2007 are enforced the risk of exposure of consumers following consumption of meat coming from susceptible animals or TSE outbreaks may be considered as acceptable. Moreover, in the absence of scientific evidence on TSE transmission to humans, the risk of contracting the disease must be considered as negligible and therefore acceptable. However, the Committee hopes for an enhancement of genetic selection programs for disease resistant animals, already envisaged by the legislation in force. Finally, the Committee invites the Directorate General for Animal Health and Veterinary Medicinal Products, that asked for the opinion, to submit the data on the evolution of the above-mentioned disease to the CNSA on a six-month basis in order to ensure constant monitoring...|$|R

Most significantly, however, the opinion is saddled with an unnecessary and unconvincing application of Justice Jackson's tripartite Youngstown framework. The Court concludes that President's effort to implement the treaty falls within the third category, but the indicia of Congressional intent that the Court relies on are weak, and the analysis works a substantial expansion of category III. Moreover, as the Court frames the issue - one of treaty interpretation - it is unclear why Youngstown should apply at all...|$|R
