5|$|Mir {{was based}} upon the Salyut series of space {{stations}} previously launched by the Soviet Union (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-manned Soyuz spacecraft and Progress cargo ships. The Buran space shuttle was anticipated to visit Mir, but its program was canceled after its first unmanned spaceflight. Visiting US Space Shuttles used an Androgynous Peripheral Attach System docking collar <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> for Buran, mounted on a bracket <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> for use with the American Space Station Freedom.|$|E
5|$|As {{with several}} {{analogous}} light military vehicles, despite being <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> {{to fill a}} light reconnaissance role, the rise of urban warfare and close quarters combat meant that the Israel Defense Forces had to recast the Storm in new roles.|$|E
5|$|He {{founded the}} company in 1938. Although Randall <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> his knives for outdoorsmen and sold them at {{sporting}} goods stores, demand from military customers initially provided his biggest boost in business, and launched his company nationally.|$|E
2500|$|The CoaXPress {{standard}} is another high-speed digital interface, <b>originally</b> <b>design</b> for industrial camera interfaces. [...] The data rates for CoaXPress {{go up to}} 6.25Gbit/s over a single coaxial cable. A 20Mbit/s uplink channel and power over coax are {{also included in the}} standard.|$|R

The site of the Agua Caliente Open, the course hosted professional golf players including Gene Sarazen, Paul Runyan, E. J. Harrison, and Ernie Vossler.|$|R
50|$|The {{stained glass}} windows were made {{according}} to designs of Klusáček. The last window {{in the south of}} the nave, <b>originally</b> <b>design</b> of Cyril Bouda, was successfully completed only in 1992. The scene shows the meeting of Duke Oldřich with St. Procopius in the woods of Sázava.|$|R
5|$|In 1905 the Whitecraigs Golf Club was founded. The {{course was}} <b>originally</b> <b>{{designed}}</b> by Willie Fernie, who was The Open Championship winner in 1883 and also designed the Ailsa course at Turnberry. Alterations {{to the course}} {{were made in the}} 1930s by James Braid, who won The Open Championship five times between 1901 and 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Star of Life {{is widely}} used, and was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> and {{governed by the}} U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, because the Red Cross symbol is legally {{protected}} by both National and international law. It indicates that the vehicle's operators can render their given level of care represented on the six pointed star.|$|E
5|$|When the MERIS sensor {{aboard the}} European Space Agency's {{satellite}} Envisat observed and recorded Hurricane Elida at peak intensity, {{it was the}} first time that the sensor had observed a hurricane. The sensor was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> primarily for recording oceanic biology and water quality as well as land vegetation, clouds, and water vapor.|$|E

5|$|While most URI schemes were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> to be {{used with}} a {{particular}} protocol, and often have the same name, they are semantically different from protocols. For example, the scheme http is generally used for interacting with web resources using HTTP, but the scheme file has no protocol.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} former rail lines in Melbourne and {{regional}} Victoria have {{been converted into}} rail trails, for walking, cycling and horse riding. These make excellent tracks for beginners as the lines were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> to avoid steep gradients. Most lines are still in public ownership. Some sections of the track are specially leased to neighbouring farmers for stock grazing. This reduces maintenance costs.|$|E
5|$|Canberra is {{a planned}} {{city and the}} inner-city area was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin's {{proposal}} had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.|$|E

5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. They were <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{was one of}} {{two large}} {{carriers}} approved for construction under the 1931–32 Supplementary Program. <b>Originally</b> <b>designed</b> as the sister ship of Sōryū, her design was enlarged and modified in light of the Tomozuru and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934–35 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and structurally weak. Her forecastle was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>originally</b> <b>design</b> as a {{double-deck}} vehicle, {{a single}} deck version entered service in 1925. The initial batch of 24 (K1078 - K1101) entered service in August 1925 with 24-seat bodies on new chassis. These {{were the first}} vehicles to use pneumatic tyres in London. Subsequent batches of single-deck K-types used new bodies on the chassis of older double-deck vehicles from which the body had been removed. Conversely, future orders of the new single-deck chassis received double-deck bodywork.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, after the final crew had left, Salyut 6 was visited by an experimental transport logistics spacecraft called Kosmos 1267 in 1982. The transport logistics spacecraft, known as the TKS, was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> for the Almaz programme, and proved that large modules could dock automatically with space stations, a major step toward the construction of multimodular stations such as Mir and the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|<b>Originally</b> <b>designed</b> as a fighter-like {{aircraft}} {{capable of}} very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it. Development was then {{taken up by the}} U.S. Army for a tactical combat aircraft requirement, a sort of high-performance helicopter. In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E
5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. <b>Originally</b> <b>designed</b> for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Originally,</b> <b>designs</b> and motifs {{were not}} {{drawn on the}} cloth. The design was first {{outlined}} with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.|$|R

5|$|The Lexington-class {{ships were}} <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> to be battlecruisers, with heavy guns, high speed, and {{moderate}} armor protection. The Navy laid down six ships {{of the class}} in 1919–20. When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers. Lexington and Saratoga were selected since {{they were the most}} advanced of the six ships in construction.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} the first appearance of Disco Stu, {{who became a}} recurring character in the series. Stu was <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> as a withered, old, John Travolta-esque figure and was to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, Hartman was not available to dub the voice and so Hank Azaria took over the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} <b>originally</b> <b>designed</b> {{as part of}} the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy {{disagreed}} with the real-world direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete. The developers, Big Red Software, were given 12 weeks to create a new game with a different character. Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to differentiate the two.|$|E
