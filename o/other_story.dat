5|$|The {{links to}} The Original Series {{were seen as}} {{positive}} improvements to Star Trek: Enterprise by critics including elements such as {{the appearance of the}} Mirror Universe and the Orion slave girls. <b>Other</b> <b>story</b> arcs praised included the Augment arc with Brent Spiner and the return of the genetic supermen made famous by Ricardo Montalbán's Khan in The Original Series. Phillip Chung of AsianWeek bemoaned the loss of the show, because he felt that it had improved over time and due to the franchise's continued progressive stance in showing racial minorities outside of the normal stereotypes.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{season of}} the American science fiction {{television}} series The X-Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 1999, concluded on May 21, 2000, and consists of twenty-two episodes.

5|$|The <b>other</b> <b>story</b> {{about the}} balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor tree and the temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment and the Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.|$|E

After {{a series}} of <b>other</b> <b>story</b> pitches, Lidster was asked to work on one of Russel T Davies’s standby plots {{concerning}} a spooky 24-hour supermarket to center on Jack and Ianto.

The store would have been possessed by a demonic creature from the rift that manifested only late at night and which feds of the human life-force.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} African-Caribbean people in the British art world has been Prof. Eddie Chambers. Chambers, along with Donald Rodney, Marlene Smith and curator, artist, critic and academic Keith Piper, founded the BLK Art Group in 1982, when they were initially based in the West Midlands. According to Chambers, significant artists such as the Guyanese-born painters Aubrey Williams and Frank Bowling and the Jamaican sculptor Ronald Moody initially found that, despite achieving worldwide renown, it was difficult to find acceptance in the highest echelons of the art establishment. Chambers worked with Donald Rodney and Sonia Boyce, both of whose work is represented in the permanent collections of the London's Tate Britain museum. In 1986 the Hayward Gallery presented the exhibition The <b>Other</b> <b>Story,</b> which provided a survey of African-Caribbean, African and Asian artists working in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Soap opera storylines run concurrently, {{intersect}} {{and lead}} into further developments. An individual episode of {{a soap opera}} will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials {{and those that are}} broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several <b>other</b> <b>story</b> threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for {{the start of a new}} yearly broadcast.|$|E
