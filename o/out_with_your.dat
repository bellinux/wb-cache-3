500|$|On March 21, 2005, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, co-stars of The Ring Two (2005), {{were cast}} as Wendy Christensen and Kevin Fischer. Winstead, who had auditioned {{for the second}} Final Destination film, won the role because her {{portrayal}} of the character's emotion impressed Wong and Morgan. Wong {{said that he had}} originally intended for Wendy to be a [...] "perky blonde" [...] and reworked the character slightly after Winstead was cast; he believed the actors were right for their roles. On Winstead, he said that [...] " [...] a kind of soulfulness to her role as Wendy" [...] and her character [...] "is deeply affected by the accident, but she's strong, and fights to maintain control". On Merriman, he said that [...] "the moment [...] came in I thought he was the right guy to play Kevin" [...] and described the character as [...] "the kind of guy you want to hang <b>out</b> <b>with,</b> <b>your</b> goofy best buddy, but also someone who could rise to the occasion and become a hero".|$|E
500|$|Several {{more members}} {{passed through the}} group, {{including}} drummer Mike Pareskuwicz of Subsist and guitarist T.J. [...] "Racine" [...] Kunasch. While Stump at this point felt uninterested in the group, Wentz was, according to Uprising Records owner Sean Muttaqi, viewing the group as [...] "the thing {{that would make him}} famous. He had a clear vision." [...] Wentz was [...] "singularly focused on taking things to the next level," [...] and threw the band into promotion via early social media. Muttaqi got word of the demo and wanted to release half of it as a split extended play with Hurley's band Project Rocket, which the band viewed as competition. Uprising desired to release an album with the emerging band, which to that point had only written three songs. With the help of Logan, the group attempted to put together a collection of songs in two days, and recorded them as Fall Out Boy's Evening <b>Out</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Girlfriend. The rushed recording experience and underdeveloped songs left the band discontent. When the band set off to Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to record three songs for a possible split 7-inch with 504 Plan, engineer Sean O'Keefe suggested the band record the trio with Hurley. Hurley was also recording an EP with his new group the Kill Pill in Chicago the same day, but raced to Madison to lay down drums for Fall Out Boy. [...] "It was still a fill-in thing but when Andy sat in, it just felt different. It was one of those [...] "a-ha" [...] moments," [...] recalled Wentz.|$|E
500|$|The band's debut album, Take This to Your Grave, {{was issued}} by Fueled by Ramen in May 2003. Previously, {{one of the}} band's {{earliest}} recordings, Evening <b>Out</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Girlfriend, had not seen release until shortly before Grave in March 2003, when the band had gained considerable momentum. [...] "Our record was something being rushed out to help generate some interest, but that interest was building before we could even get the record out," [...] said Sean Muttaqi. The band actively tried to stop Uprising from releasing the recordings (as the band's relationship with Muttaqi had grown sour), as the band viewed it as a [...] "giant piece of garbage" [...] recorded before Hurley's involvement that the band members ceased to consider the debut album of the group. Gradually, the band's fanbase grew in size as the label pushed for the album's mainstream success. According to Wentz, shows began to end in a near-riot and the group were banned from several venues because the entire crowd would end up onstage. The band gained positive reviews for subsequent gigs at South by Southwest (SXSW) and various tour appearances. The band joined the Warped Tour for five dates {{in the summer of}} 2004, and on one date the band had only performed three songs when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd. The band appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 2004 edition of Alternative Press, and listening stations at Hot Topic partially helped the album move 2,000-3,000 copies per week by Christmas 2004, at which point the label considered the band [...] "tipping" [...] into mainstream success.|$|E

2500|$|J. G. Quintel {{returned}} to the characters from his films, put them together with newer characters and created a pilot. Quintel wanted to present a visual pitch rather than a verbal one, believing the idea would make little sense otherwise. He storyboarded {{the idea for the}} pilot, and Craig McCracken and Rob Renzetti liked his presentation. Regular Show was one of two series from the project that were green-lit (the other show being Secret Mountain Fort Awesome, based on the Cartoonstitute short Uncle Grandpa, which in turn became its own series later on). The project was eventually scrapped and never premiered on television. The character of Mordecai embodies Quintel during his college years, specifically at CalArts; Quintel said, [...] "That's that time when you're hanging <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> friends and getting into stupid situations, but you're also taking it seriously enough." [...] The character of Rigby was randomly developed when Quintel drew a raccoon hula-hooping. He liked the design and developed the character of Rigby to be far less responsible than his companion.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, an {{anonymous}} {{phone call to}} the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that several heavily armed people were staying at the caller's daughter's house. That afternoon, more than 400 LAPD officers, {{under the command of}} Captain Mervin King, along with the FBI, California Highway Patrol, and Los Angeles Fire Department surrounded the neighborhood. The leader of a SWAT team used a bullhorn to announce, [...] "Occupants of 1466 East 54th Street, this is the Los Angeles Police Department speaking. Come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> hands up!" [...] A young child walked out, along with an older man. The man stated that no one else was in the house, but the child intervened stating that several people were in the house with guns and ammo belts. After several more attempts to get anyone else to leave the house, a member of the SWAT team fired tear gas projectiles into the house. This was answered by heavy bursts of automatic gunfire, and a violent gun battle began. The police were firing semi-automatic AR-15 and AR-180 rifles. The SLA members were armed with M1 Carbines, which had been converted to fully automatic fire. Police also reported that the SLA had created homemade grenades from 35mm film canisters, and had thrown them at responding officers.|$|E
2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
