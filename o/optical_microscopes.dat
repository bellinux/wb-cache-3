5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E
25|$|Diamond is {{notorious for}} having a {{relatively}} large lattice strain. Strain splits and shifts optical transitions from individual centers resulting in broad lines in the ensembles of centers. Special care is taken to produce extremely sharp N-V lines (line width ~10nbsp&MHz) required for most experiments: high-quality, pure natural or better synthetic diamonds (type IIa) are selected. Many of them already have sufficient concentrations of grown-in N-V centers and are suitable for applications. If not, they are irradiated by high-energy particles and annealed. Selection of a certain irradiation dose allows tuning the concentration of produced N-V centers such that individual N-V centers are separated by micrometre-large distances. Then, individual N-V centers can be studied with standard <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> or, better, near-field scanning <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> having sub-micrometre resolution.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the larger}} the {{aperture}} of the lens, and the smaller the wavelength, the finer the resolution of an imaging system. This is why telescopes have very large lenses or mirrors, and why <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> are limited in the detail which they can see.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the digital}} {{microscope}} has the image projected directly {{on to the}} CCD camera, {{it is possible to}} have higher quality recorded images than with an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> With the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> the lenses are designed for the optics of the eye. Attaching a CCD camera to an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> will result in an image that has compromises due to the eyepiece.|$|R

25|$|Historically, the {{calculation}} of glass properties {{is directly related to}} the founding of glass science. At the end of the 19th century the physicist Ernst Abbe developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> in Jena, Germany, stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of Carl Zeiss. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of microscopes was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe knew exactly how to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required lenses and prisms with specific ratios of refractive index and dispersion did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1870s, as <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{improved}} and {{the principles of}} stratigraphy were worked out, Robert Kidston and P. Reinsch were able to examine the presence of fossil spores in the Devonian and Carboniferous coal seams and make comparisons between the living spores and the ancient fossil spores. Early investigators include Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (radiolarians, diatoms and dinoflagellate cysts), Gideon Mantell (desmids) and Henry Hopley White (dinoflagellate cysts).|$|E
25|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> and {{magnifying}} devices {{also present}} unique safety challenges. If any optical power is present, {{and a simple}} magnifying device is {{used to examine the}} fiber end, then the user is no longer protected by beam divergence, since the entire beam may be imaged onto the eye. Therefore, simple magnifying devices should never be used in such situations. Optical connector inspection microscopes are available which incorporate blocking filters, thus greatly improving eye safety. The most recent such design also incorporates protection against red fault locating lasers.|$|E

25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet microscopes {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes.</b> This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion that}} viruses were {{particles}} {{was not considered}} unnatural and fitted in nicely with the germ theory. It is assumed that Dr. J. Buist of Edinburgh {{was the first person}} to see virus particles in 1886, when he reported seeing [...] "micrococci" [...] in vaccine lymph, though he had probably observed clumps of vaccinia. In the years that followed, as <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> were improved [...] "inclusion bodies" [...] were seen in many virus-infected cells, but these aggregates of virus particles were still too small to reveal any detailed structure. It was not until the invention of the electron microscope in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska (1906–1988) and Max Knoll (1887–1969), that virus particles, especially bacteriophages, were shown to have complex structures. The sizes of viruses determined using this new microscope fitted in well with those estimated by filtration experiments. Viruses were expected to be small, but the range of sizes came as a surprise. Some were only a little smaller than the smallest known bacteria, and the smaller viruses were of similar sizes to complex organic molecules.|$|E

50|$|The optical microscope, often {{referred}} to as light microscope, is a type of microscope which uses visible light and a system of lenses to magnify images of small samples. <b>Optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century.

50|$|Microscopes can be {{separated}} into several different classes. One grouping {{is based on}} what interacts with the sample to generate the image, i.e., light or photons (<b>optical</b> <b>microscopes),</b> electrons (electron microscopes) or a probe (scanning probe microscopes). Alternatively, microscopes can be classed on whether they analyze the sample via a scanning point (confocal <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes,</b> scanning electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes) or analyze the sample all at once (wide field optical microscope and transmission electron microscopes).|$|E
50|$|Wide field <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> and {{transmission}} electron microscopes both use the theory of lenses (optics for light microscopes and electromagnet lenses for electron microscopes) in order to magnify the image generated by {{the passage of a}} wave transmitted through the sample, or reflected by the sample. The waves used are electromagnetic (in <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes)</b> or electron beams (in electron microscopes). Resolution in these microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the radiation used to image the sample, where shorter wavelengths allow for a higher resolution.|$|E
