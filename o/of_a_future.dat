25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>futures</b> {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date.

5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E

The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E

5|$|J. Gordon Edwards (1867–1925) was a Canadian American film director, screenwriter, and {{producer}} of the silent era. His oeuvre consists of over fifty feature films made between 1914 and 1924.

He decided against a life in the military in favor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> in theater. At the time, the Canadian theater and film industry was limited primarily to repertory theatre, so Edwards became one of many to emigrate to the United States to work in the field. He had a short career as an actor before becoming a stage director. By 1910, he was working for American motion picture producer William Fox, who sent him to Europe to study film production.|$|E
