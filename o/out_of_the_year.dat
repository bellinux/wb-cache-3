Additionally, {{it turned out that}} the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was abandoned in 1962.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
5|$|During the Western Han, farming peasants {{formed the}} {{majority}} of those who were conscripted by the government to perform corvée labor or military duties. For the labor service (gengzu 更卒), males aged fifteen to fifty-six would be drafted for one month <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> to work on construction projects and perform other duties in their commanderies and counties. For the military obligation (zhengzu 正卒), all males aged twenty-three were to train for one year in one of three branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or navy. Until they reached age fifty-six, they were liable to perform one year of active service as troops sent to guard the frontiers from hostile nomads or to act as guards in the capital city. Significant changes were made to this system during Eastern Han; a commuting tax could be paid by peasants if they wanted to avoid the one-month labor obligation, since hired labor became more popular in construction and other projects. The military service obligation could even be avoided if a peasant paid a commuting tax, since the Eastern Han military became largely a volunteer force. Other commoners such as merchants were also able to join the army.|$|E

5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E

25|$|Since it was built, {{the complex}} {{has been a}} pilgrimage and {{procession}} site. The architecture and decorative features reflect the doctrine of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, as it was built {{with the principles of}} the Counter-Reformation in mind. The sanctuary’s role as a site for penance, according to the exercises of Ignatius Loyola, began in 1765 with 25 people participating and directed by Father Neri. The sanctuary {{has been one of the}} principal places in Mexico to practice the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, which include mortification of the flesh through flagellation and fasting. During Holy Week, an estimated 5,000 perform these exercises and wear crowns of thorns on their heads. It is one of 33 weeks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> when visitors, mostly from the center and north of the country, visit the Casa de Ejercicios to perform penance. A complete cycle of penance, prayers and meditation lasts eight days. It can receive up to 5,000 visitors each week.|$|E
25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed {{to be available to}} them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs.

25|$|Theoretically it was {{the duty}} of the pharaoh to carry out temple rituals, as he was Egypt's {{official}} representative to the gods. In reality, ritual duties were almost always carried out by priests. During the Old and Middle Kingdoms, there was no separate class of priests; instead, many government officials served in this capacity for several months <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before returning to their secular duties. Only in the New Kingdom did professional priesthood become widespread, although most lower-ranking priests were still part-time. All were still employed by the state, and the pharaoh had final say in their appointments. However, as the wealth of the temples grew, the influence of their priesthoods increased, until it rivaled that of the pharaoh. In the political fragmentation of the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BC), the high priests of Amun at Karnak even became the effective rulers of Upper Egypt. The temple staff also included many people other than priests, such as musicians and chanters in temple ceremonies. Outside the temple were artisans and other laborers who helped supply the temple's needs, as well as farmers who worked on temple estates. All were paid with portions of the temple's income. Large temples were therefore very important centers of economic activity, sometimes employing thousands of people.|$|E
