500|$|John, which {{regularly}} describes Jesus' opponents {{simply as}} [...] "the Jews", is more consistently hostile to [...] "the Jews" [...] {{than any other}} body of New Testament writing. Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: [...] "The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan." [...] In [...] Jesus tells the Jews: [...] "You are <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> the devil, and the desires <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him." [...] In [...] and , [...] "the Jews" [...] are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus. However, Carroll cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospel of Matthew and the 1 Thessalonians {{should be viewed as}} [...] "evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews" [...] {{in the early years of}} the Christian church.|$|E

500|$|Jane was {{in contact}} with Irish Land League leaders, {{including}} John Dillon and William O'Brien, and lobbied {{for the release of}} the latter after his imprisonment under the Coercion Act of 1881. She and her sisters supported the Irish Plan of Campaign, a scheme whereby tenants acted collectively to secure fair rents from their landlords. This plan was eventually denounced by the Roman Catholic Church as contrary to natural justice and Christian charity, although some priests supported it. [...] The attachment of Jane and her sisters to the rebellious factions in Ireland strained relations between the sisters and many of their father's former Liberal Unionist colleagues, but won approval from Thomas Bayley Potter, who had succeeded Richard Cobden as MP for Rochdale. In October 1887 he wrote to Jane: [...] "You are true to the living and just instincts <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>father...</b> You know your father's heart better than John Bright does".|$|E

2500|$|It was in Corinth that {{a meeting}} between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is {{supposed}} to have taken place. These stories may be apocryphal. The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, [...] "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." [...] Alexander then declared, [...] "If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes." [...] "If I were not Diogenes, I would still wish to be Diogenes.", Diogenes replied. In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, [...] "I am searching for the bones <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Midrash, Rashi {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> has given you treasure," [...] to mean that God gave them the money in their merit, and if their merit was insufficient, the God of their father Jacob gave it {{to them in the}} merit of their father. Similarly, the 12th century Italian Rabbi Menachem ben Shlomo taught that the words [...] "your God" [...] signified that it was a reward for their fearing God, while the words [...] "the God of your fathers" [...] signified that it was a reward for Jacob's fearing God. Rashbam, however, read [...] to report that everyone knew that the brothers regularly benefitted from miracles. And David Kimhi (RaDaK) interpreted the steward to mean that if the brothers found the money in their sacks, it was a gift from heaven, comparable to if a human being had given them a treasure.|$|E
2500|$|Malbim {{read the}} steward's {{words to the}} {{brothers}} in [...] "Your God, and the God <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> has given you treasure," [...] to mean that since the money being brought to Egypt {{from all over the}} world was only [...] "a treasure" [...] – that is, hidden away in the treasury until the time of the Exodus from Egypt, when it would become the Israelites' – the steward told the brothers that their treasure could remain in their sacks, for it made no sense to place it in Pharaoh's treasury, when it was destined for them in any case. Professor Nahum M. Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the steward's reassuring reply was intelligible only on the assumption that he was privy to Joseph's scheme. [...] His purpose was to lull the brothers into a false sense of relief. Professor Robert Alter of University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the steward dismissed the brothers' fears by introducing a kind of fairy tale explanation for the silver that they found in their bags. But Professor Jon D. Levenson of Harvard Divinity School wrote that the steward sensed the hand of a beneficent Providence in the strange events.|$|E
