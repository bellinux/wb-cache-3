5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the original form <b>of</b> <b>skiing,</b> from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form <b>of</b> <b>skiing</b> where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts {{or other forms of}} assistance.

Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E

40|$|Overexpression <b>of</b> the <b>Ski</b> pro-oncogene {{has been}} shown to induce myogenesis in non-muscle cells, to promote muscle {{hypertrophy}} in postnatal mice, and to activate transcription of muscle-specific genes. However, the precise role <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> in muscle cell differentiation and its underlying molecular mechanism are not fully understood. To elucidate the involvement <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> in muscle terminal differentiation, two retroviral systems were used to achieve conditional overexpression or knockdown <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> in satellite cell-derived C 2 C 12 myoblasts. We found that enforced expression <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> promoted differentiation, whereas loss <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> severely impaired it. Compromised terminal differentiation in the absence <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> was likely because of the failure to induce myogenin (Myog) and p 21 despite normal expression of MyoD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional reporter experiments showed that Ski occupied the endogenous Myog regulatory region and activated transcription from the Myog regulatory region upon differentiation. Transactivation of Myog was largely dependent on a MEF 3 site bound by Six 1, not on the binding site of MyoD or MEF 2. Activation of the MEF 3 site required direct interaction <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> with Six 1 and Eya 3 mediated by the evolutionarily conserved Dachshund homology domain <b>of</b> <b>Ski.</b> Our results indicate that Ski is necessary for muscle terminal differentiation and that it exerts this role, at least in part, through its association with Six 1 and Eya 3 to regulate the Myog transcription...|$|R
5|$|In 1939, the Norwegian Ski Federation {{proposed}} that the Association for the Promotion <b>of</b> <b>Skiing</b> arrange slalom {{as part of the}} Holmenkollen Ski Festival, but the plans were interrupted by World War II. The slalom hill was inaugurated in 1947, allowing Alpine skiing to be introduced in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. Slalom took place at Rødkleiva while the downhill was carried out at Norefjell Ski Resort in Krødsherad. The event was named Holmenkollen Kandahar and the races in Rødkleiva were organized by SFK Lyn. Permanent cables for telephone and timing were installed in 1949.|$|E

Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out ski hills, designed ski lifts, became ski coaches, racers, instructors, patrollers, shop owners, and filmmakers. They wrote and published ski magazines, opened ski schools, improved ski equipment, and developed ski resorts. Up to 2,000 of the division's troops were involved in skiing-related professions after the war, and at least 60 ski resorts were founded by men of the division.|$|E

Several members had already held positions in the older organization Association for the Promotion <b>of</b> <b>Skiing,</b> founded three weeks before Ull, in 1883. Johan Bechholm was its first secretary, from 1883 to 1886, and many others followed. Johan Sverre (member since 1896) was a notable Olympic administrator after the Norwegian independence in 1905, and Hjalmar Krag (member since 1887) became chairman in the Confederation of Sports. Fritz R. Huitfeldt also became a known figure in his field; for his ski bindings, and for pioneering Telemark skiing. Huitfeldt's ski factory, which he started together with Richard Blichfeldt, was named Ull.|$|E
