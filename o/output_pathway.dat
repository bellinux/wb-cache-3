40|$|AbstractAnalysis of the Drosophila lark gene {{indicates}} that it encodes an RNA-binding protein that functions as a regulatory element of the circadian clock <b>output</b> <b>pathway</b> controlling adult eclosion. We now demonstrate that the lark RNA-binding protein oscillates in abundance during the circadian cycle; importantly, the phasing of the lark rhythm is consistent with gene-dosage studies, which indicate that the protein behaves as a repressor molecule. The lark protein rhythm persists in constant conditions (continuous darkness and constant temperature) and is eliminated by period gene null mutations, confirming that it is under clock control and suggesting that it acts as an output mechanism that mediates the temporal regulation of adult eclosion. We also show that lark protein oscillates in abundance within a defined group of neuropeptide (CCAP) -containing neurons of the ventral nervous system (VNS), which in other insects are thought to comprise cellular elements of the clock <b>output</b> <b>pathway</b> regulating eclosion...|$|E
40|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{behavior}} and physiology are under circadian control. In Drosophila, the molecular clock that regulates rhythmic patterns of behavior has been extensively characterized. In contrast, genetic loci involved in linking the clock to alterations in motor activity have remained elusive. In a forward-genetic screen, we uncovered a new component of the circadian <b>output</b> <b>pathway,</b> which we have termed dyschronic (dysc). dysc mutants exhibit arrhythmic locomotor behavior, yet their eclosion rhythms are normal and clock protein cycling remains intact. Intriguingly, dysc is the closest Drosophila homolog of whirlin, a gene linked to type II Usher syndrome, {{the leading cause of}} deaf-blindness in humans. Whirlin and other Usher proteins are expressed in the mammalian central nervous system, yet their function in the CNS has not been investigated. We show that DYSC is expressed in major neuronal tracts and regulates expression of the calcium-activated potassium channel SLOWPOKE (SLO), an ion channel also required in the circadian <b>output</b> <b>pathway.</b> SLO and DYSC are co-localized in the brain and control each other 2 ̆ 7 s expression post-transcriptionally. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate they form a complex, suggesting they regulate each other through protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings of neurons in the adult brain show that SLO-dependent currents are greatly reduced in dysc mutants. Our work identifies a Drosophila homolog of a deaf-blindness gene as a new component of the circadian <b>output</b> <b>pathway</b> and an important regulator of ion channel expression, and suggests novel roles for Usher proteins in the mammalian nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Circadian kaiBC {{expression}} in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is generated by temporal information transmission from the KaiABC-based circadian oscillator to RpaA, a putative transcriptional factor, via the SasA-dependent positive pathway and the LabA-dependent negative pathway {{which is responsible for}} feedback regulation of KaiC. However, the labA/sasA double mutant has a circadian kaiBC expression rhythm, suggesting that there is an additional circadian <b>output</b> <b>pathway.</b> Here we describe a third circadian <b>output</b> <b>pathway,</b> which is CikA-dependent. The cikA mutation attenuates KaiC overexpression-induced kaiBC repression and exacerbates the low-amplitude phenotype of the labA mutant, suggesting that cikA acts as a negative regulator of kaiBC {{expression in}}dependent of the LabA-dependent pathway. In the labA/sasA/cikA triple mutant, kaiBC promoter activity becomes almost arrhythmic, despite preservation of the circadian KaiC phosphorylation rhythm, suggesting that CikA largely accounts for the residual kaiBC expression rhythm observed in the labA/sasA double mutant. These results also strongly suggest that transcriptional regulation in the labA/sasA/cikA triple mutant is insulated from the circadian signals of the KaiABC-based oscillator. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which temporal information from the KaiABC-based circadian oscillator is transmitted to gene expression through three separate output pathways...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{progress in}} defining central {{components of the}} circadian pacemaker, the <b>output</b> <b>pathways</b> coupling the clock to rhythmic physiological events remain elusive. We previously showed that LARK is a Drosophila RNA-binding protein which functions downstream of the clock to mediate behavioral outputs. To better understand the roles of LARK in the circadian system, we sought to identify RNA molecules associated with it, in vivo, using a three-part strategy to (1) capture RNA ligands by immunoprecipitation, (2) visualize the captured RNAs using whole-genome microarrays, and (3) identify functionally relevant targets through genetic screens. We found that LARK {{is associated with a}} large number of RNAs, in vivo, consistent with its broad expression pattern. Overexpression of LARK increases protein abundance for certain targets without affecting RNA level, suggesting a translational regulatory role for the RNA-binding protein. Phenotypic screens of target-gene mutants have identified several with rhythm-specific circadian defects, indicative of effects on clock <b>output</b> <b>pathways.</b> In particular, a hypomorphic mutation in the E 74 gene, E 74 (BG 01805), was found to confer an early-eclosion phenotype reminiscent of that displayed by a mutant with decreased LARK gene dosage. Molecular analyses demonstrate that E 74 A protein shows diurnal changes in abundance, similar to LARK. In addition, the E 74 (BG 01805) allele enhances the lethal phenotype associated with a lark null mutation, whereas overexpression of LARK suppresses the early eclosion phenotype of E 74 (BG 01805), consistent with the idea that E 74 is a target, in vivo. Our results suggest a model wherein LARK mediates the transfer of temporal information from the molecular oscillator to different <b>output</b> <b>pathways</b> by interacting with distinct RNA targets...|$|R
40|$|Saccadic eye {{movements}} can be elicited by {{more than}} one type of sensory stimulus. This implies substantial transformations of signals originating in different sense organs as they reach a common motor <b>output</b> <b>pathway.</b> In this study, we compared the prevalence and magnitude of auditory- and visually evoked activity in a structure implicated in oculomotor processing, the primate frontal eye fields (FEF). We recorded from 324 single neurons while 2 monkeys performed delayed saccades to visual or auditory targets. We found that 64 % of FEF neurons were active on presentation of auditory targets and 87 % were active during auditory-guided saccades, compared with 75 and 84 % for visual targets and saccades. As saccade onset approached, the average level of population activity in the FEF became indistinguishable on visual and auditory trials. FEF activity was better correlated with the movement vector than with the target location for both modalities. In summary, the large proportion of auditory-responsive neurons in the FEF, the similarity between visual and auditory activity levels {{at the time of the}} saccade, and the strong correlation between the activity and the saccade vector suggest that auditory signals undergo tailoring to match roughly the strength of visual signals present in the FEF, facilitating accessing of a common motor <b>output</b> <b>pathway...</b>|$|E

40|$|The plant {{circadian}} clock controls {{many aspects}} of growth and development, allowing an individual to adapt its physiology and metabolism in anticipation of diurnal and seasonal environmental changes. Circadian regulation of hormone levels and hormonal signalling modulates many features of development, including daily growth patterns and the breaking of seed dormancy.

Moreover, the clock restricts (gates) the sensitivity of a plant's response to environmental cues, such as light and stress, to specific times of the day, ensuring that the plant can distinguish between normal fluctuations and longer-term changes.
