40|$|This {{fact sheet}} reviews recent {{research}} examining how winter-based outdoor recreation along the North Shore of Lake Superior {{will be affected}} by climate change. The research revealed the majority of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> who visit the region now won’t change their travel plans as temperatures increase and the snow and ice thins out. However, a substantial number of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> indicated they will visit the region more often in the future. This is largely due to longer shoulder seasons, which support these individuals’ preferred outdoor recreational activities. Knowing how outdoor recreationists’ behavioral responses to climate change vary will help community planners and natural resource managers make decisions that will benefit both their communities and their guests...|$|R
40|$|Social {{researchers}} have independently investigated behaviors in voluntary association membership {{and participation in}} outdoor recreation activities. A small amount of scholarly work has theorized a link between activity in voluntary associations and recreation behavior. These studies have concentrated on the associational affiliations of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists,</b> and their concern for the environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if differences exist between <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> who are members of environmental/outdoor recreation voluntary associations, and those who are nonmembers. Organizational membership was designated as the dependent variable. Independent variables were designed to assess (1) incentives for voluntary association membership, (2) motivations for participation in outdoor recreation activities, (3) environmental concern, and (4) social class. A random sample of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> was drawn from the California membership of a large recreational equipment cooperative (R. E. I. Co-op). Data were collected by mail survey. Of the 1500 questionnaires sent, thirty-four were undeliverable, and 1085 were returned for a response rate of 74. 0 percent. The sample reflected a substantially higher organizational membership level than the general population with a forty percent membership rate. Members were differentiated from nonmembers by significantly higher ratings on (1) instrumental incentives (public goods) for membership in voluntary associations, (2) intellectual motivations for participation in outdoor recreation, (3) environmental concern, and (4) age and education level. A discriminant function analysis identified instrumental incentives as the most powerful predictor of organizational membership. Results indicated public goods are a primary incentive for <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> to join voluntary associations. This suggests a need to re-define instrumental benefits in light of the personal values associated with them. A common thread of intellectual pursuit distinguished members from nonmembers. Intellectual motivations for outdoor recreation, education level, age and environmental concern provided evidence that members are somewhat more oriented toward intellectual development, suggesting that environmental and outdoor recreation-related voluntary associations might benefit from focusing on the educational benefits of membership, and directing promotional communications through channels used by <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> Given the findings of a strong relationship between outdoor recreation and voluntary association membership, further scholarly work should concentrate on the instrumental and intellectual benefits of both behaviors to promote understanding of their synergy...|$|R

40|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} place has been generally defined by two distinct and highly refined discourses within outdoor recreation research: place attachment {{and sense of}} place. Place attachment generally describes {{the intensity of the}} place relationship, whereas sense of place approaches place from a more holistic and intimate orientation. This study bridges these two methodological and theoretical separate areas of place research together by re-conceptualizing the way in which place relationships are viewed within outdoor recreation research. The Psychological Continuum Model is used to extend the language of place attachment to incorporate more of the philosophy of sense of place while attending to the empirical strength and utility of place attachment. This extension results in the term place allegiance being coined to depict the strong and profound relationships <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> build with their places of outdoor recreation. Using a concurrent mixed methods research design, this study explored place allegiance via an online survey (n = 437) and thirteen in-depth qualitative interviews with <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> Results indicate that place allegiance can be measured through a multi-dimensional model of place allegiance that incorporates behaviours, importance, resistance, knowledge and symbolic value. In addition, place allegiance was found to be related to an individual's influence on life course and his/her willingness to exhibit preservation and protection tendencies. Place allegiance {{plays an important role in}} acknowledging the importance of authentic place relationships in an effort to confront placelessness.

To better understand these changing conditions, biophysical and economic values of nature {{have been used}} to prioritize spatial planning efforts and ecosystem-based management of human activities. Less is known, however, about how to characterize and represent non-material values in decision-making. We collected on-site and mailback survey data (n = 209), and analyzed these data using the Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) GIS application to incorporate measures of social value and natural resource conditions on Hinchinbrook Island National Park, Australia. Our objectives in this paper are to: 1) determine the spatial distribution and point density of social values for ecosystem services; 2) examine the relationship between social values and natural resource conditions; and 3) compare social value allocations between two subgroups of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> Results suggest that high priority areas exist on Hinchinbrook's land and seascapes according to the multiple values assigned to places by <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> engaged in consumptive (e. g., fishing) and non-consumptive (e. g., hiking) activities. We examine statistically significant spatial clustering across two subgroups of the survey population for three value types that reflect Recreation, Biological Diversity, and Aesthetic qualities. The relationship between the relative importance of social values for ecosystem services and spatially-defined ecological data is explored to guide management decision-making {{in the context of an}} island national park setting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: A meta-analytic {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the hypothesis that consumption of water from North American backcountry sources poses a statistically significant risk for acquisition of giardiasis. Methods: The biomedical literature was surveyed by accessing Medline, and identified studies were supplemented with references in current reviews, published dissertations, and prior communications with state health departments. Studies were classified by methodologic design and subjected to predetermined inclusion criteria. Odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals, chi-squares, and P-values for epidemiologic surveys were either computed from raw data or abstracted directly from the included studies. Results: Of 104 articles identified in the initial screening, nine met the inclusion criteria. Neither of two case reports met the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for waterborne disease outbreak. Two prospective studies were identified, but neither showed a significant association. Of four case-control studies providing data, three reported an odds ratio of greater than one. Conclusions: Published reports of confirmed giardiasis among <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> clearly demonstrate a high incidence among this population. However, the evidence for an association between drinking backcountry water and acquiring giardiasis is minimal. Education efforts aimed at <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> should place more emphasis on handwashing than on water purification. Further studies should attempt to separate the specific risk factor of drinking water from backcountry sources from other behaviors among this group that may contribute to the risk...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were to analyse {{perceptions}} of recreational access to nature, and factors that might impact on those perceptions, {{as well as}} to propose an argument for wider access as a way of fostering environmental awareness. The investigations were carried out by way of interviews with members of two of the foremost organisations in Britain representing the interests of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> – the Ramblers and the British Mountaineering Council – and through a number of surveys with recreationists. The results of the investigations indicate that there is fairly widespread contentment with the extent of access in the area, that knowledge regarding access legislation is somewhat patchy and that a fair amount of conflicts and constraints to access are regularly encountered by <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> These perceptions appear to be shaped by a societal structure in which a relative minority of landowners possess the power to shape how the remainder of society relates to these spaces. The political ecology of the English countryside – the effects of power and social differentiation – is thus clearly manifest in how recreational access is perceived and contested. My final conclusion is that facilitating recreational forays and a widening of access should be regarded as key ways to achieve a fair and environmentally aware society.

Quantitative risk estimates are available for some of the UV-B-associated effects, e. g., cataract and skin cancer; however, the data are insufficient to develop similar estimates for effects such as immunosuppression and the toxicity of alternatives.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wildlife {{damage caused}} by species {{normally}} managed as game animals or furbearers should be of major concern to wildlife managers and various user groups: hunters, trappers, and other <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> Real or potential damage {{may be used as}} an important factor in determining population levels, harvest goals, and distribution of white-tailed deer and Canada geese in Wisconsin. In any state where private land and agriculture are important, such a strategy could reduce wildlife populations and associated recreational opportunities. Recent surveys in Wisconsin have quantified the amount and distribution of deer, goose, and turkey damage in Wisconsin. These data allow comparisons between wildlife damage and total agricultural production, other causes of crop loss, and the positive economic impact of these species. Additionally, comparisons are possible between perceived losses and maximum potential losses. A review of the problems caused by each animal provides a framework to discuss the issue of wildlife damage to farm crops and the implications for managers and resource users. The double- crested cormorant provides a special example of a resource management problem with wildlife damage...|$|R

This exploratory study examined the information sharing processes between groups of <b>recreationists</b> at two <b>outdoor</b> recreation settings in Sam Houston National Forest. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} develop theory that will explain information sharing among strangers in leisure settings. To reach this objective, several steps were necessary: a) identify the type and content of information shared among the sample of recreationists; b) analyze the types of relationships that support information sharing behavior; c) investigate how information relationships are patterned across egocentric networks; d) evaluate linkages in the networks by comparing network profiles across activities and groups; e) develop hypotheses for future testing of recreation information network models. The study pointed out that at these sites, information was not a valuable resource which could be exchanged, disseminated, or given as a gift. Instead, information was valuable for one's social well-being during the participation in these environments. The content of information shared among the sample of recreationists ranged from objective information related to the outdoor recreation environment and activities, to a limited amount of work or family related personal information. Topics such as religion or politics were rarely discussed. The respondents mainly described their relationships with recreationists outside their group as acquaintances, or no relationship. The findings show that <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> at the two settings at Sam Houston National Forest prefer to have privacy and limit their interaction with others outside their group. Visitors have constructed norms of behavior at these two settings that protect their desire for privacy. It was reasoned that such an environment was not stimulating for the development of new relationships. Instead, recreationists chose to focus on strengthening their existing ties. Most contact with others outside the group remained at a casual level and never progressed to a relationship. In network terms, these <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> occupied structurally equivalent positions in that they had no social ties to others outside their group. Consequently, they exhibit similar patterns of relations to all other recreationists they do not know, and should therefore be studied using a positional rather than relational approach.

Eight hundred ninety-four parties were interviewed one year after the outbreak in four separate surveys. The objective was to determine the respondents' awareness of the insect problem, and their behavior and attitude toward the problems and changes. The study indicated that, over a long period of time, the secondary stage of the infestation has a greater impact and is of more concern than the direct annoyance and nuisance of the primary stage of the insect outbreak. The greatest direct change attributable to the tussock moth was the visual appearance in the landscape of dead and dying trees. Comments about new roads, logging, and changes in the game populations and habitat were more noticeable and mentioned more often than those of the Douglas-fir tussock moth.

Understanding recreationists helps us by identifying the habits, views, and economic contribution of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> Policy makers then have an additional tool when making public land decisions that impact outdoor recreation. As part of a study examining interactions between recreationists and wildlife, we surveyed 311 recreationists at various trailheads in the Owyhee Recreational Area. In addition to gathering demographic information (average age: 34 - 49, average spent in 2013 : $ 4, 700), we asked about views on public land policies and use, and perceived recreational impacts on the ecosystem. The data show that although recreationists don’t agree with total trail closures, they do agree that trails should be seasonally closed to protect sensitive wildlife. When asked about factors that affect the integrity of public lands (wildfires, off-highway recreation, climate change, etc.) initial results show a moderate correlation (r=. 77498) between factors they had personally observed and their views on how those factors should be managed.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> and other land {{users in the}} United Kingdom has been, and continues to be, contentious. Why this exists in the UK is due to two main factors. First, is {{the influence of the}} historical development of land ownership patterns over the past ten centuries, where consequently now over half the land is owned by only 0. 06 per cent of the population (Fairlie, 2009). Millions of outdoor recreationalists every year may unwittingly cross over land where private landlords guard their land rights closely. Second, practically every hectare 1 of land can be classified as multifunctional, the most obvious and predominant of which is combinations of primary food production and secondary outdoor recreation and nature conservation. This multifunctionality is fairly unusual globally: in North America and Australasia, for example, access to the outdoors is limited to areas deliberately set aside for recreational purposes or as wilderness for both biodiversity and recreation. This explains why National Parks in the UK are living, working landscapes, whereas in most {{other parts of the world}} National Parks are wilderness (e. g. Runte, 1987).

Some changes, including criminal activities and domestic terrorism, may have quite important impacts to outdoor enthusiasts and managers. Activities include some relatively traditional management challenges, like arson and thefts, and newer challenges, such as domestic violence and murder. To better understand the prevalence and impacts of these activities, selected managers in the western United States were interviewed in summer and fall 1998.

40|$|Protected {{areas are}} {{critical}} locations worldwide for biodiversity preservation and offer important opportunities for increasingly urbanized humans to experience nature. However, biodiversity preservation and visitor access are often at odds and creative solutions {{are needed to}} safeguard protected area natural resources {{in the face of}} high visitor use. Managing human impacts to natural soundscapes could serve as a powerful tool for resolving these conflicting objectives. Here, we review emerging research that demonstrates that the acoustic environment is critical to wildlife and that sounds shape the quality of nature-based experiences for humans. Human-made noise is known to affect animal behavior, distributions and reproductive success, and the organization of ecological communities. Additionally, new research suggests that interactions with nature, including natural sounds, confer benefits to human welfare termed psychological ecosystem services. In areas influenced by noise, elevated human-made noise not only limits the variety and abundance of organisms accessible to <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists,</b> but also impairs their capacity to perceive the wildlife that remains. Thus soundscape changes can degrade, and potentially limit the benefits derived from experiences with nature via indirect and direct mechanisms. We discuss the effects of noise on wildlife and visitors through the concept of listening area and demonstrate how the perceptual worlds of both birds and humans are reduced by noise. Finally, we discuss how management of soundscapes in protected areas may be an innovative solution to safeguarding both and recommend several key questions and research directions to stimulate new research...|$|R
40|$|A {{wilderness}} accident can be {{an unfortunate}} outcome for <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> participating in risk-related recreation or outdoor adventure pursuits. Some pursuits in certain environments or conditions {{increase the likelihood of}} accidents, but no individual?regardless of experience level?is immune to the possibility of an accident given inherent risks. Accident encompasses environmental and/or human factors that may be at play in the cause. Narratives from <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> indicate a certain degree of emotional or psychological burden that results from both risk and the aftermath of accidents when they occur. Most scholarly inquiry aimed at understanding the impacts of risks and accidents has been directed toward recreationists participating at intense and extreme levels. Devotee hobbyists have indicated that risks and accidents constitute disappointments. A premise in this study is that wilderness accidents cause stress and may further constrain or influence behaviors regarding future participation in similar or related pursuits. The stress-coping model proposed by Lazarus and Folkman was used as a theoretical guide for this study. The model includes influential personal and situational factors, stress appraisal, coping mechanisms, and short- and long-term outcomes. The stress-coping model has been suggested as useful for deepening an understanding of efforts made to negotiate in the face of leisure constraints. It has been used extensively in studies where conflicts in outdoor recreation settings were believed to cause stress to recreationists. In this study, level of investment toward adventure recreation pursuits, proximity to the accident, and severity of the accident served as personal and situational factors within the model. They further represented constructs believed to influence coping strategies and the likelihood of return to participation post-accident. Level of investment was an umbrella term used to take into consideration behavioral and attitudinal characteristics often associated with the concepts of Serious Leisure and Recreation Specialization. Level of investment includes the degree in which a particular outdoor adventure activity or set of activities has become a central life interest. The term accounts for other characteristics associated with involvement like commitment, identification, experience, skills/training, and perceived rewards/motivations. Coping strategies are instrumental in determining short-term outcomes and are further associated with long-term outcomes like quality of life. In-depth interviews were used to gain informed knowledge about the impacts of wilderness accidents among recreationists. Results from the interviews were used to provide a thorough understanding of the prevalence of stress, coping strategies, and outcomes to recreationists based on wilderness accident exposure. This study relied heavily on theoretical and purposive sampling to ensure that a wide range of experience levels were considered. Proximity to and severity of the accident, in addition to level of investment, were used as factors of comparison in the analyses. Coping mechanisms revealed in the data analyses were compared to the more prevalent forms of coping functions identified in previous studies in outdoor recreation as well as the emotion-focused and problem-focused measures in the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOCQ). The WOCQ is a 66 -item questionnaire that measures the processes individuals use to cope with internal and/or external demands of stressful encounters.

In part, the group’s goals are to: (1) provide a community forum for scientific information/education related to healthy ecosystems and issue resolution through the collaborative process; and (2) develop sustainable relationships and expectations that reduce conflicts, simplify and streamline planning, and provide multiple use opportunities. In addition to regular membership meetings on various natural resource topics, the group has hosted 21 symposia and workshops. An impact evaluation survey of NNSG members (n = 31, response rate = 64 %) for a 5 -year evaluation period showed the following based on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 = unsuccessful, 5 = very successful) : building trust and respect among the NNSG constituency, 4. 3; providing a community forum for education, 4. 7; working to reduce conflicts, 4. 0.

40|$|Impacts on {{parks and}} {{protected}} areas are modifying ecosystems that provide benefits to sustain {{human health and}} well-being. Compelling evidence of ecological and economic values has been gathered {{to better understand the}} implications of these changing social-ecological conditions; however, social values have received considerably less attention. There is a strong need to integrate disciplinary perspectives on the value concept and illustrate the full value of nature experienced through outdoor recreation activities. My dissertation drew from theoretical frameworks in psychology, economics, and ecology to better understand the multiple values of Channel Islands National Park (CINP), California, U. S. Specifically, I examined ?held? value orientations, ?assigned? values of ecosystem services, and ecological values of the CINP. In first of three papers, I tested the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of environmentalism to determine the psychological processes driving low-impact behavior among <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> I observed that behavioral engagement was more strongly related to biospheric-altruistic held values than egoistic concerns. Also, moral norm activation was a direct antecedent to behaviors that minimized the spread of invasive species, degradation of archeological artifacts, and overfishing in marine protected areas. In the second paper, I investigated how environmental worldview shaped the spatial dynamics of assigned values for ecosystem services on Santa Cruz Island within the CINP. Using Public Participation Geographic Information Systems methods, I found that held value orientations (i. e., biocentrism, anthropocentrism) manifested different values ascribed to marine and terrestrial environments. In the third paper, I compared assigned biodiversity values to spatially-explicit measures of ecosystem structure and function using a Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) mapping application and Maximum Entropy modeling. My results showed that distance to features relevant for park management, carbon sequestration, species richness, elevation, vegetation density, and several categories of land cover predicted the locations and intensity of preferences for biodiversity on Santa Cruz...|$|R

While the articles are about specific norms, the summary article focus on how these norms are negotiated between locals and tourists and how they in sum {{can be seen as}} a negotiable room – a moral landscape of the outdoors. Firstly, I set out to investigate how nature based tourism is affecting the normative negotiations among hunters, anglers and <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> in North Troms. Secondly, I have focused on what these norms can do. The data presented in this dissertation are collected through participant observation and interviews. The fieldwork was conducted over 12 months between 2011 and 2012. The fieldwork includes participatory engagements with tourists, guides, companies and locals outside the industry. This comprises activities like ice fishing, small game hunting, canoe paddling, salmon angling, glacier hikes and deep sea angling. The most extensive part of the fieldwork was a four months internship with a nature based tourism company in the region. During the internship I got to work as a co-guide as well participate as customer to test their products. The main finding of this dissertation is that nature based tourism has a substantial impact on how outdoor recreation is practiced and how acceptable behavior in nature is negotiated and reconstructed in North Troms. The norm denotes the line between the acceptable and the un-acceptable. The negotiations about where this line should be drawn mark the processes that altogether constitute morality. These processes are characterized by a tension and overlap between outdoor recreation and tourism as something non-commercial and commercial, that I argue is a symbiotic antagonism. This antagonism, which must be seen as extremes on a scale rather than a dichotomy, leads in turn to a morality of the outdoors that is unique to North Troms...|$|R
40|$|Macro-economic forces, {{technological}} innovations in equipment, abundant wildlife populations, changing participation levels, and land access are all {{contributing to a}} changing environment for wildlife managers and <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists.</b> Since the late 1970 s, numerous studies have periodically examined hunter and angler spending in North Dakota; however, comprehensive assessments of changes in spending over time have not been conducted. The purpose of this report was to evaluate changes in hunter and angler spending from 1981 through 2001 and evaluate spending patterns based on selected participant characteristics. For resident hunters, increasing trends in miles traveled, spending on lodging, and spending on durable goods were observed, while overall spending on nondurable goods remained relatively unchanged. Average spending by nonresident hunters generally increased for nondurable goods, but no conclusive trends in durable good purchases were found. Average spending on durable and nondurable goods increased for resident anglers, while average spending was mostly constant over the period for nonresident anglers. The shifts in spending were generally widespread among a majority of survey activities, yet the magnitude of spending changes was subtle. When spending levels were evaluated based on selected participant characteristics, statistically significant differences were found. The strongest relationships in spending levels were found with miles traveled, days participated, and whether the participant paid access and/or guide fees. Weaker relationships were found in differences in spending levels associated with location of residence (i. e., rural versus urban participants) and percentage of spending in rural areas. Only minor differences in spending levels were found with variations in age and income. Policy makers may wish to consider a data collection system {{in the future that}} provides more predictive assessments of sportsman spending and includes additional geographical information on spending, rather than the current system which produces mostly descriptive assessments and provides virtually no geographical distribution of spending within the state. hunting, fishing, expenditures, North Dakota, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Though <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> {{have not}} always been viewed as environmentalists, a latent {{potential}} exists to leverage outdoor recreation as a means toward cultivating environmental values and empowering communities to work collectively toward addressing environmental solutions. Evidence of this promise is emerging through examples of civic recreation – recreation-based stewardship and advocacy aimed at preserving, creating, and restoring recreational resources - that has gained significant traction in the past twenty years. Drawing from a mixed-method research design that combines a comparative case study of local civic recreation organizations with survey research, this dissertation aims to describe civic recreation in practice and explore how it fits into the larger environmental project of the 21 st century. Specifically, the first goal is to understand why, how, and to what end these organizations emerge and function. Secondly, I explore the motivations of the individuals who volunteer for civic recreation practices and outcomes they report from their volunteer efforts. Finally, I attempt to unpack the complex nexus between outdoor recreation and environmentalism more broadly. I find that civic recreation organizations emerge either out of a threat to access or the vision of an innovative leader who seeks to create a recreational resource. These organizations primarily focus on direct stewardship, collaboration with land managers, and innovative private-public partnerships for the purposes of preserving or creating recreational resources. This model offers promise to an era of collaborative and community-based natural resource management. At the individual level, I find that civic recreation volunteers are highly motivated by their desire to make a difference, express their environmental values, and enhance their community through recreation. Through volunteering, individuals report positive outcomes such as enhanced self-efficacy and learning, a deepened connection to nature and place, and a strengthened community of collaborative and shared responsibility for its natural resources. These findings are significant, as civic recreation volunteers may not see themselves as advancing an environmental or conservation agenda. Therefore, individuals may stumble into conservation and environmental citizenship through their passion for outdoor recreation...|$|R
40|$|DNR personnel, {{along with}} {{staff at the}} West Virginia GIS Technical Center, have worked {{diligently}} this year to provide <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> with a virtual tool. Whether you hunt, trap, fish, hike, canoe or go on birdwatching outings, you’ll find a new mapping tool on our website to be very helpful. The mapping tool {{can be found at}} www. wvdnr. gov under either the Hunting or Fishing headings, or by clicking on the black bear icon {{at the top of the}} home page. While similar to the interactive trout stream map which has been on the DNR website for five years, this also includes information on warmwater fishing and hunting. You can find instructions for using the map on the landing page, choose whether you want to explore information related to hunting or fishing, and then click the appropriate box. Once on the appropriate map of West Virginia, you’ll find a variety of tools at your disposal. I like the fact that you can view the maps as either topo maps or as satellite images. On the hunting map, hunters and trappers can find the location of license agents, check stations, public shooting ranges, wildlife management areas, Class Q hunter access roads, and hiking trails throughout the state. A search option allows you to focus on a specific county, WMA or state forest. If you want to check on fishing information while on the hunting page, a simple click reveals fishing and boating access sites, trout stocked streams, public fishing lakes, and float trips. A tool allows you to measure the length of a stream section you wish to float. As with the hunting site, an option allows you to search for a specific body of water or county. While the tool works best with a high-speed Internet connection, those with dial-up can still access the maps, albeit at a slower pace. I welcome you to visit our website and explore your favorite haunts with this new mapping tool. After planning your adventure online, then go out and experience the best that West Virginia has to offer...|$|R
40|$|With {{the public}} {{acquisition}} of Valles Caldera National Preserve in 2000, Congress granted management to a Board of Trustees, a unique experiment in public land management. Ten {{years into the}} experiment, the trust model has been failing to meet certain management objectives and is under pressure by <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> to provide greater public access to this treasured piece of land in New Mexico. Pressure has become {{so great that the}} United States Senators from New Mexico have introduced legislation, the Valles Caldera National Preserve Management Act, which would transfer management to the National Park Service. To address this blossoming issue, and to really understand what is happening on this highly treasured land, this research sets out explore the many attitudes and perceptions of the Valles Caldera’s recreationists. To gather the necessary data set, a survey questionnaire was developed and administered to recreationists of the Valles Caldera through a number of online mediums, posted flyers, and various on-site methods. At the time the surveys were closed to the public, 712 (36 %) recreationists had responded to the survey. A detailed statistical analysis of the acquired data was then performed using Vaske’s (2008) Potential for Conflict Index, the chi-square test, and other descriptive methods in order to help bridge the gap between these recreational perceptions and attitudes, and future management decisions on the Valles Caldera. The intent and purpose of this research is to provide future managers of the Valles Caldera, whoever that might be, with valuable information that can lead to management actions that appropriately reflect the needs of those using the Caldera for recreation. Further, this research offers the opportunity for the public to have their voice heard where it may not have existed otherwise. This research has identified recreationists’ attitudes and perceptions towards public access, religious and cultural sites, environmental preference, crowding, livestock grazing. Preference for recreational activities and the amount of money recreationists are willing to spend to recreate are also discussed. More specifically, this thesis has revealed that all surveyed recreationists are dissatisfied with their current level of access to the Valles Caldera, {{and that there is a}} major split in respondent’s preferences towards the protection of cultural and religious sites when it could limit access for recreationists. Results also identified that some groups favor or understand environmental values more than other groups, and that a majority of recreationists favor quality of experience over quantity. Research also found that livestock grazing does not diminish the recreational experience for most visitors. For numerous questions, recreationists were subdivided and analyzed by interest group and socio-demographic characteristics. GeographyMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The {{forests of}} Sweden provide many {{amenities}} (e. g. timber, outdoor recreation and biodiversity) {{that contribute to}} the welfare of forest owners and other stakeholder groups in society. The amenities have characteristics of private and public goods. In this thesis, measures of attitudes and values towards different forest amenities were studied by means of mail surveys and existing literature. In paper I, the attitudes of private forest owners regarding different forest amenities (timber production, outdoor recreation and biodiversity) were investigated and compared with the forest advisors’ interpretation of the forest owners’ attitudes. The survey was conducted in three regions of Sweden (South, Central and North). The results indicated that the timber production was the most important amenity to the private forest owners, followed by outdoor recreation and biodiversity. The forest officers’ understanding of what was important to forest owners did not consistently coincide with the attitudes of the forest owners. Other aspects of outdoor recreation and biodiversity among stakeholder groups of the Swedish public were studied in papers II, III and IV. In paper II, a travel cost analysis was used to estimate the recreational value of the forests in the southernmost part of Sweden (Skåne and Blekinge). An analysis was also conducted to determine how this value would be affected by a change in the share of broadleaves in the region. It was shown that maintaining or increasing the share of broadleaves would positively affect the recreational value. In paper III, outdoor recreation was studied using data on health measures of recreationists from three different mail surveys, (<b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists</b> among the general Swedish public, forest recreationists in southern Sweden and hunters in Sweden). The results showed that outdoor recreation activities in all three categories were expected to {{have a positive impact on}} self-rated health. In paper IV, the value of attaining the national environmental objectives of Sweden, including the protection of forest land for biodiversity purposes, was studied using data from a contingent valuation survey. The value varied between different levels of forest land protection, and the benefits of protection outweighed the costs by a small margin. The values of amenities in a typical broadleaved and a coniferous stand during a rotation period were reviewed in paper V. The results suggested that most amenity values developed in a similar way during the rotation period in the two stands. This was true for all amenities except for berries. Considering recreational values in forest management is unlikely to affect the timing of harvesting decisions, while considering biodiversity values as part of forest management would tend to prolong the rotation age...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Presentation date: 1993 - 07 - 21 Since the {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, the rural communities within its shadow have experienced tremendous change. Tourism has become a highly visible and somewhat controversial component {{of change in the}} region, and its importance to local economies has increased. As a result of increased tourism development in these small communities conflict and competition for available resources, goods and services has steadily increased. Thus, management agencies and development planners have become increasingly concerned with attitudes and overall receptiveness of host populations toward further tourism development. Since its eruption Mount St. Helens has attracted millions of tourists to southwest Washington State. County, state and federal governments have spent millions of dollars in developing the region for tourism. The seasonal influx of visitors has a tremendous physical, economic and social impact upon the rural timber communities which neighbor the volcano. Communities which once catered to the needs of hunters, fishermen and other <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreationists,</b> are scrambling to satisfy the demands of tourists seeking to view the devastation. This research was designed to measure the attitudes and perceptions of those residents living in the rural communities near the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument toward tourism. Perceptions of the volcanic hazards associated with living near a volcano and the influence of those hazards on tourism were also surveyed. The research utilized informal interviews and a comprehensive questionnaire to develop a body of original data on resident perception of tourism's impact on their community. As the case study areas for this investigation, three communities located along the primary highways entering the monument were selected. Excluding differences in population, these unincorporated communities share similar economies, social attributes and physical characteristics. Questionnaires were mailed to over 1, 000 households within the three communities. A combined response rate of 53 % was achieved using the Diliman's Total Design Method (TDM). A variety of statistical techniques, including item analysis, rank score, chi-square and factor analysis, were used to analyze the data. Perhaps the single most important finding from the study was the general prevalence of positive attitudes toward tourism in all three communities. These optimistic attitudes were attributed to the nascent stage of tourism development coinciding with decades of exposure to recreationists and nature seeking tourists. A correlation between the residents' age and their perception of tourism was also identified. Tolerance levels varied from community to community. Attitudes and perceptions of tourism were most optimistic among the older residents. Cultural exchange between residents and tourists, and other economic rewards were the most predominant tourism benefits identified by respondents. Tourism was blamed for increased congestion on local highways and overcrowding in stores, restaurants and community parks. Future tourism development appears to be inevitable, and in some instances even desirable within the study communities. Due to the frequency of contact between residents and tourists, tourism planners, managers and public officials need to recognize the perceptions and attitudes of local residents, and incorporate them into regional development plans and management policies if tourism is to be successful...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many have {{hypothesized}} and intuited {{a relationship}} between participation in outdoor recreation and concern {{about the state of}} the environment. It is believed that participating in outdoor recreation can influence environmental concern by exposing people to specific instances of environmental degradation and increasing their concern about such degradation on a broader scale. Research examining this phenomenon has found moderate to weak support for a direct connection between outdoor recreation participation and environmental concern. Using structural equation analysis, we examined whether the meaning of non-consumptive <b>outdoor</b> recreation to <b>recreationists</b> mediated the relationship between non-consumptive outdoor recreation participation and environmental concern. A mail-back survey of Washington State residents (n = 900) found that outdoor recreation meaning was a better predictor of environmental concern than measures of participation. However results also suggest that the relationship between environmental concern and the meaning of non-consumptive outdoor recreation was not a particularly strong one and that meaning is likely one of many factors that might influence environmental concern...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Mount Hood National Forest {{provides}} {{opportunities for}} {{many forms of}} <b>outdoor</b> recreation. <b>Recreationists</b> spend money to pursue outdoor activities on public lands such as national forests and national parks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the economic contribution of national forest visitor expenditures on the local economy of the Mount Hood National Forest. Secondary sources were used to gather expenditure data for 13 outdoor recreation activities and to provide recreation visitor use projections for the year 2000. The regional input-output model IMPLAN was used to model changes in final demand attributable to projected growth in per-capita consumption of outdoor recreation from Mount Hood National Forest. Economic impacts were estimated for the proposed economic region in terms of final demand, total output, total income, number of jobs, and net migration. Methods for nonsurvey economic data reconciliation are also presented. Base-year (1987) final demand attributable to outdoor recreation was found to be 1. 0 - 1. 5 percent of total regional final demand. Base-year output, income, and employment were found to be 0. 5 - 1. 0 percent of regional totals. Likely impacts of future visitor expenditures are forecasted based on a low-growth, high-growth, and variable-growth projection of future visitation to Mount Hood National Forest. Under the three projections presented, outdoor recreation related economic impacts are predicted to increase by 25 to 55 percent above the 1987 base year recreation-related regional totals, for the thirteen year projection period ending in the year 2000. Significant variation in impacts across the regions was identified for some industrial sectors. This was attributed to possible differences in locational characteristics of the affected sectors. None of the outdoor recreation-related industries exhibited significant sectoral impact variation across regions...|$|R
