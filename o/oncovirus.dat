25|$|In 1975 the {{functioning}} of oncoviruses was clarified considerably. Until that time, {{it was thought that}} these viruses carried certain genes called oncogenes which, when inserted into the host's genome, would cause cancer. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus showed that the oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus is in fact not specific to the virus but is contained in the genome of healthy animals of many species. The <b>oncovirus</b> can switch this pre-existing benign proto-oncogene on, turning it into a true oncogene that causes cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (...) is a {{retrovirus}} and is {{the first}} <b>oncovirus</b> to have been described: it causes sarcoma in chickens.|$|E
50|$|These were {{previously}} {{divided into three}} subfamilies (Oncovirinae, Lentivirinae, and Spumavirinae), but are now divided into two: Orthoretrovirinae and Spumaretrovirinae. The term <b>oncovirus</b> is now commonly used to describe a cancer-causing virus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oncoviruses</b> are {{implicated in}} {{approximately}} 12 % {{of all human}} cancers. A large number of the world’s population harbors {{at least one of}} these <b>oncoviruses,</b> but only a small proportion of these individuals go on to develop cancer. The interplay between host and viral factors is a complex process that works together to create a microenvironment conducive to oncogenesis. In this review, the molecular biology and oncogenic pathways of established human <b>oncoviruses</b> will be discussed. Currently, there are seven recognized human <b>oncoviruses,</b> which include Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), Human T-cell lymphotropic virus- 1 (HTLV- 1), Human Herpesvirus- 8 (HHV- 8), and Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV). Available and emerging therapies for these <b>oncoviruses</b> will be mentioned...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oncoviruses</b> are viral {{agents that}} are {{similarly}} suspected of causing cancer.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, cancer {{research}} {{led to a}} cold war incident, where co-operative samples of reported <b>oncoviruses</b> were discovered to be contaminated by HeLa.|$|R
5000|$|... 1964: Anthony Epstein, Bert Achong and Yvonne Barr {{identify}} {{the first human}} <b>oncovirus</b> from Burkitt lymphoma cells. A herpesvirus, this virus is formally known as human herpesvirus 4 but more commonly called Epstein-Barr Virus or EBV.|$|E
50|$|Charlotte Friend (March 11, 1921 - January 13, 1987) was an American virologist. She is {{best known}} for her {{discovery}} of the Friend leukemia virus. She helped to establish the concept of the <b>oncovirus,</b> studied the role of the host immune response in disease development, and helped define modern retrovirology.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its high}} {{efficiency}} as an <b>oncovirus,</b> particularly in newborn or immunodeficient mice, mouse polyomavirus {{has served as a}} productive mechanism for modeling tumorigenesis. Because most of that efficiency is due to MTag, the protein alone has also been extensively used to induce tumors in animal models. Transgenically expressed MTag is used in the widely studied MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|The key {{significance}} {{of this study is}} the development of a database termed as Oncvir. The resource is developed using Hypertext Preprocessor, Hyper Text Markup Language and JavaScript as front-end and MySQL as backend. OncVir mainly in-houses information on nucleotide sequence, protein sequence and protein structure information’s of human <b>oncoviruses.</b> <b>Oncoviruses</b> are those categories of viruses which assist in the immortalization of the cancer cells. The key classification factor of these viruses is its genetic material either DNA or RNA. OncVir is a database which comprehends the information of human oncogenic viruses such as Hepatitis B Virus, Human Papilloma Virus; Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes Virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, Hepatitis C virus, Human T-lymphotropic virus and Human Cytomegalovirus. This knowledgebase includes information from literature and other public available databases. The database is accessible to keyword searching via., simple and advanced options. It integrates about 215 nucleotide sequence records, 158 protein sequence records and 68 structural information associated with <b>oncoviruses.</b> It also facilitates additional facility to users to submit their sequence and structural data using tools such as OncSeq and OncTer, respectively. Moreover, additional information including description of viruses with illustrations, overview about the database, new events and updates are also available. In short Oncvir serves as a single access point for substantial and multitudinous information about human <b>oncoviruses...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2002 the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer {{estimated}} that 11.9% of human cancers {{are caused by}} one of seven viruses (see <b>Oncovirus</b> overview table). These are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV4); Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8); Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV); Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1); Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV); {{and a group of}} alpha Human papillomaviruses (HPVs).|$|E
5000|$|An <b>oncovirus</b> is a {{virus that}} can cause cancer. This term {{originated}} from studies of acutely transforming retroviruses in the 1950-60s, often called oncornaviruses to denote their RNA virus origin.It now refers to any virus with a DNA or RNA genome causing cancer and is synonymous with [...] "tumor virus" [...] or [...] "cancer virus". The vast majority of human and animal viruses do not cause cancer, probably because of longstanding co-evolution between the virus and its host.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, Bittner {{felt that}} genetic and {{hormonal}} influences, {{along with the}} milk agent, contributed to the origin of cancer. In 1966, it was proven that Bittner’s [...] "milk factor" [...] was a virus that remained dormant during the early life of the young mouse but produced cancer when hormonal conditions were right in middle age. The Bittner virus {{is now known as}} the Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a retrovirus. (see Timeline of Discovery 1936 under <b>Oncovirus).</b>|$|E
50|$|Abnormal {{proteins}} {{are also}} produced by cells infected with <b>oncoviruses,</b> e.g. EBV and HPV. Cells infected by these viruses contain latent viral DNA which is transcribed {{and the resulting}} protein produces an immune response.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>oncoviruses</b> are DNA viruses. Some RNA viruses {{have also}} been {{associated}} such as the hepatitis C virus as well as certain retroviruses, e.g., human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV).|$|R
50|$|Some, but not all, polyomaviruses are <b>oncoviruses</b> {{capable of}} {{inducing}} neoplastic transformation in some cells. In oncogenic polyomaviruses, the tumor antigens {{are responsible for}} the transformation activity, although the exact molecular mechanisms vary from one virus to another.|$|R

50|$|A {{virus that}} can cause cancer is called an <b>oncovirus.</b> These include human {{papillomavirus}} (cervical carcinoma), Epstein-Barr virus (B-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma), Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (Kaposi's Sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (T-cell leukemias). Bacterial infection may also {{increase the risk of}} cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma. Parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include Schistosoma haematobium (squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder) and the liver flukes, Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis (cholangiocarcinoma).|$|E
50|$|Research {{has also}} shown that some populations of koalas, {{particularly}} an isolated colony on Kangaroo Island {{do not appear to}} have the endogenous form of the retrovirus. This suggests that the virus gene sequence is a new acquisition for the koala genome. Prevalence of KoRV (and KIDS) in Australian koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north down to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free. Prior to this 'koala retrovirus' was used to refer to an unidentified <b>oncovirus</b> detected in cancer-affected koalas.|$|E
50|$|Joseph Frank Sambrook (born 1 March 1939 in Liverpool, England) is a British {{molecular}} biologist {{known for his}} studies of DNA <b>oncoviruses</b> and the molecular biology of normal and cancerous cells. He resides in Melbourne, Australia {{with his wife and}} daughter.|$|R
40|$|The {{representations}} of the mutations {{and the nature of}} spontaneous mutation process and mutagenesis induced by exogenous <b>oncoviruses,</b> DNAs and proteins-mitogens are analysed. Exogenous biological factors induce DNA damages in regulatory-informational way, acting on the cellular systems for maintenance of genetical stability. Molecular mechanisms are the same as at spontaneous mutagenesis but they are realized with the participation of alien genetical material. Among biological mutagens, the <b>oncoviruses</b> and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are distinguished as the strongest destabilizing factors which direct tumor transformation of somatic mammalian cells. Genetical reprogramming or changing the programs of gene expression at the differentiation of stem and progenitor cells under growth factors and citokines is probably followed by mutations and recombinations as well...|$|R
50|$|A {{transmissible}} {{cancer is}} a cancer cell or cluster of cancer cells that can be transmitted from animal to animal. They are quite rare in humans.

5000|$|After {{completing}} bachelor {{degrees in}} biology and electrical {{engineering at the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mertz attended graduate school at Stanford University from 1970-1975, earning a Ph.D. in Biochemistry. While taking a course held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in summer 1971, she mentioned her plan to grow mutants of the <b>oncovirus,</b> SV40, by molecular cloning {{of them in the}} human gut bacterium, E. coli. This event led, initially, to a voluntary moratorium on cloning of viral oncogenes and, later on, the cloning of any DNA that might contain potentially biohazardous materials until theoretical safety concerns could be addressed and guidelines for their safe use could be developed and implemented ...|$|E
50|$|Yoshida {{was born}} in Toyama, Japan and {{received}} his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of Tokyo. After his postdoctoral fellowship at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, he worked to uncover the relationship between <b>oncovirus</b> and carcinogenesis at the Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research from 1975 to 1989. He was appointed as Professor at the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo in 1989, where he served as Dean from 1996 to 1998. After retiring from the University of Tokyo and becoming Professor Emeritus, he was Director at the Tsukuba Research Institute of BANYU Pharmaceutical Co. (Merck & Co. today) in Tsukuba and Director at the Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.|$|E
5000|$|LTag is {{encoded in}} the [...] "early region" [...] of the polyomavirus genome, {{so named because}} this {{region of the genome}} is {{expressed}} early in the infectious process. (The [...] "late region" [...] contains genes encoding the viral capsid proteins.) The early region typically contains at least two genes and is transcribed as a single messenger RNA processed by alternative splicing. The LTag gene is usually encoded in two exons, of which the first overlaps with the gene for the small tumor antigen (STag); as a result, the two proteins share an N-terminal sequence of around 80 residues, while the remaining ~90 residues of STag are unshared. In a few polyomaviruses - most notably murine polyomavirus, the first member of the family discovered and an efficient <b>oncovirus</b> - an additional protein called middle tumor antigen is expressed from the early region and is highly efficient at cellular transformation.|$|E
50|$|Work in Botchan's {{laboratory}} {{focuses on}} studying {{the regulation of}} DNA replication during cell division, using Drosophila embryos as a model organism. The group has been {{particularly interested in the}} mechanisms of genomic integration of DNA <b>oncoviruses</b> and in the characterization of the eukaryotic origin recognition complex.|$|R
50|$|Some viruses {{have the}} ability to {{transform}} normal cells into cancer cells. Human <b>oncoviruses</b> include human papilloma virus, Epstein-Barr virus or Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus. The transformed cells often express permanently some viral genes. This leads to the presentation of viral antigenic peptides absent from normal cells.|$|R
50|$|Damage to DNA can {{be caused}} by {{exposure}} to radiation, chemicals, and other environmental sources, but mutations also accumulate naturally over time through uncorrected errors in DNA transcription, making age another risk factor. <b>Oncoviruses</b> can cause certain types of cancer, and genetics are also known to play a role.|$|R
50|$|MTag occurs {{only in a}} few known polyomaviruses, while STag and LTag both {{appear in}} all known members of the family. MTag is best studied in the mouse polyomavirus, {{which was the first}} polyomavirus {{discovered}} and which is a potent <b>oncovirus</b> under certain in vivo conditions. MTag is also well known from the hamster polyomavirus, although the sequence C-terminal to the J domain has little homology between the mouse and hamster viruses. Until recently, these were the only two polyomaviruses known to encode MTag, but in 2015 the genome sequence of a rat polyomavirus was reported to contain MTag as well. This observation is consistent with expectations that it evolved uniquely in the rodent lineage of the polyomavirus family. However, evidence of MTag encoding and expression has also recently been reported in at least one virus of unrelated lineage, the trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus, which is a normally asymptomatic infection in humans that sometimes causes the rare disease trichodysplasia spinulosa in immunocompromised individuals. A somewhat more common tumor antigen variant, an overprinted gene encoding a protein called ALTO, may be evolutionarily related to MTag.|$|E
50|$|The human T-{{lymphotropic}} virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, {{or human}} T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) family of viruses are {{a group of}} human retroviruses that are known to cause a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, {{and the ones that}} infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus 2 HTLV-II, HTLV-III, and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the <b>oncovirus</b> subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-III. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the vaccinia virus-T 7 RNA polymerase-based {{expression}} system for studies on the activity of proteases from various retroviruses on homologous and heterologous Gag polyproteins in eukaryotic cells. Proteases from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, equine infectious anaemia virus, human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 and human spumavirus were produced and were shown to cleave their cognate Gag substrates produced in trans. Analysis of cross reactivity revealed that lentivirus proteases cleaved only entivirus Gag proteins and <b>oncovirus</b> proteases acted primarily on <b>oncovirus</b> Gag proteins. The HIV- 2 protease cleaved the HIV- 1 Gag precursor almost as efficiently as HIV- 1 protease. Expression of the 5 ' end of the human spumavirus polgene revealed that it encodes afunctional protease that acts specifically on the human spumavirus Gag polyprotein. This assay will allow further investi-gation on the activity and specificity of retrovirus proteases in eukaryotic ells...|$|E

40|$|Approximately 12 % of {{all human}} cancers are caused by <b>oncoviruses.</b> Human viral {{oncogenesis}} is complex, and {{only a small percentage}} of the infected individuals develop cancer, often many years to decades after the initial infection. This reflects the multistep nature of viral oncogenesis, host genetic variability, and the fact that viruses contribute to only a portion of the oncogenic events. In this review, the Hallmarks of Cancer framework of Hanahan and Weinberg (2000 and 2011) is used to dissect the viral, host, and environmental cofactors that contribute to the biology of multistep oncogenesis mediated by established human <b>oncoviruses.</b> The viruses discussed include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively), human T cell lymphotropic virus- 1 (HTLV- 1), and Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} genome of the jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), {{the suspected}} etiological agent of ovine pulmonary carcinoma, has been cloned from viral particles secreted in lung exudates of affected animals and sequenced. The genome is 7, 462 nucleotides long and exhibits a genetic organization {{characteristic of the}} type B and D <b>oncoviruses.</b> Comparison of the amino acid sequences of JSRV proteins {{with those of other}} retrovirus proteins and phylogenetic studies suggest that JSRV diverged from its type B and D lineage after the type B mouse mammary tumor virus but before the type D <b>oncoviruses</b> captured the env gene of a reticuloendotheliosislike virus. Southern blot studies show that closely related sequences are present in sheep and goat normal genomic DNA, indicating that JSRV could be endogenous in ovine and caprine species...|$|R
