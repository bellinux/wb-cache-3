50|$|After {{the proof}} of concept was completed, laboratory-scale silicon wafers were {{fabricated}} using standard semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication techniques. E-beam lithography was used to fabricate the arrays of loop antenna metallic structures. The optical antenna consists of three main parts: the ground plane, the <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> cavity, and the antenna. The antenna absorbs the electromagnetic wave, the ground plane acts to reflect the light back towards the antenna, and the <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> cavity bends and concentrates the light back towards the antenna via the ground plane. This work did not include production of the diode.|$|E
50|$|An optical microdisk, optical microtoroid, or optical {{microsphere}} uses {{internal reflection}} {{in a circular}} geometry {{to hold on to}} the photons. This type of circularly symmetric <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> is called a Whispering gallery mode, after Lord Rayleigh coined the term.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the method of detection of <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> by observation of the fluorescence light emitted from a fast beam excited by a laser in collinear geometry is often limited by the optical pumping. In our method, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the optical pumping process to detect <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> by using a second laser beam in almost collinear geometry which acts as a detector of optical pumping...|$|R
40|$|In the {{conventional}} Mie scattering theory with dielectrics, resonances only {{appear in the}} optical range when the index of refraction tends to infinity. In this article we present a method to obtain <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> {{through the use of}} Laguerre-Gaussian beams. Using these beams, and due to the properties of angular momentum, we can convert the scattering ripple structure into <b>optical</b> <b>resonances.</b> Both the position of these resonances as well as the linewidth can be modified according to our needs. 3 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn photonics, {{the field}} {{concentration}} and enhancement have been major objectives for achieving sizereduction and device integration. Plasmonics offers resonant field confinement and enhancement, butultra-sharp <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> in all-dielectric multi-layer thin films are {{emerging as a}} powerful contestant. Thus, applications capitalizing upon stronger and sharper <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> and larger fieldenhancements could be faced with a choice for the superior platform. Here, we present a comparisonbetween plasmonic and dielectric multi-layer thin films for their resonance merits. We show that theremarkable characteristics of the resonance behavior of optimized dielectric multi-layers can outweighthose of their metallic counterpart...|$|R
50|$|Polaritons are bosonic quasiparticles {{which can}} be thought of as dressed photons. In an optical cavity, photons have an {{effective}} mass, and when the <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> in a cavity is brought near in energy to an electronic resonance (typically an exciton) in a medium inside the cavity, the photons become strongly interacting, and repel each other. They therefore act like atoms which can approach equilibrium due to their collisions with each other, and can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at high density or low temperature. The Bose condensate of polaritons then emits coherent light like a laser. Because the mechanism for the onset of coherence is the interactions between the polaritons, and not the optical gain that comes from inversion, the threshold density can be quite low.|$|E
5000|$|For {{resonant}} pumping of an <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> {{and when}} the pump precedes the test, the absorption change [...] is usually negative {{in the vicinity of}} the resonance frequency.This effect called bleaching arises from the fact that the excitation of the system with the pump pulse reduces the absorbance of the test pulse.There may also be positive contributions to [...] spectrally near the original absorption line due to resonance broadening and at other spectral positions due to excited-state absorption, i.e., optical transitions to states such as biexcitons which are only possible if the system is in an excited state.The bleaching and the positive contributions are generally present in both coherent and incoherent situations where the polarization vanishes but occupations in excited states are present.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic concept}} of this photonic-assisted all-dielectric RF {{front-end}} technology {{is shown in}} Fig. 1. The Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) in the front-end, functions as a concentrator of incoming electromagnetic field. When the electromagnetic (EM) field excites the resonance of DRA, a mode field pattern is built up inside the structure. The EO resonator is placed {{at the location of}} the peak field magnitude (Fig. 2). The EO resonator converts the received EM signal to an intensity modulated optical signal which is then carried away from the antenna front-end via an optical fiber. At the remote location, the signal is converted back to an RF signal which is then amplified and processed using conventional techniques.This front-end design significantly increases the threshold for damage associated with high power microwave signals. The lack of metal interconnects eliminates the one source of failure. In addition, the charge isolation provided by the optical link protects the electronic circuitry. Good sensitivity can be achieved due to signal enhancement provided by the microwave resonance in the DRA and <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> in the EO resonator. The modulating E-field (ERF) applied to the resonator should not be uniform across the disk otherwise no modulation occurs. To prevent this from happening, the EO resonator is placed off center from the symmetrical axis of DRA as shown in Fig. 2. The location of the EO resonator is chosen to coincide with the peak EM field inside the DRA, which is identified using 3-D EM simulations.|$|E
40|$|We {{carried out}} an {{analysis}} {{to investigate the}} morphology dependent <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> shift (MDR) of a rotating spherical resonator. The spinning resonator experiences an elastic deformation due to the centrifugal force acting on it, leading to a shift in its MDR. Experiments are also carried out to demonstrate the MDR shifts of a spinning polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microsphere. The experimental results agree well with the analytical prediction. These studies demonstrated that spinning sensor based on MDR may experience sufficient shift in the <b>optical</b> <b>resonances,</b> therefore interfering with its desirable operational sensor design. Also {{the results show that}} angular velocity sensors could be designed using this principle...|$|R
50|$|Therefore, it {{is often}} {{customary}} to specify <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> as excitonic instead of exciton resonances. The actual role of excitons on optical response can only be deduced by quantitative changes to induce to the linewidth and energy shift of excitonic resonances.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} and energy {{distribution}} of <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> is of central importance in low-dimensional materials$^{ 1 - 4 }$ and its knowledge is critical for designing efficient optoelectronic devices. Ruddlesden-Popper halide perovskites are 2 D solution-processed quantum wells with a general formula A$_ 2 $A'$_{n- 1 }$M$_n$X$_{ 3 n+ 1 }$, where optoelectronic properties can be tuned by varying the perovskite layer thickness (n value), and have recently emerged as efficient semiconductors with technologically relevant stability. However, fundamental questions concerning the nature of <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> (excitons or free-carriers) and the exciton reduced mass, and their scaling with quantum well thickness remains unresolved. Here, using optical spectroscopy and 60 -Tesla magneto-absorption supported by modelling, we unambiguously demonstrate that the <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> arise from tightly bound excitons with unexpectedly high exciton reduced mass (0. 20 m 0) and binding energies varying from 470 meV to 125 meV with increasing thickness from n= 1 to 5. Our work demonstrates the dominant role of Coulomb interactions in 2 D solution-processed quantum wells and presents unique opportunities for next-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices.

In addition to the fundamental mode, the disk resonator has higher-order whispering gallery modes. The excited second-order higher-order mode has a node at the position where the electromagnetic energy of the fundamental mode is close to a maximum. This high resolution measurement of <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> mode profile {{has a variety of}} applications for optical sensing and detection. The self-referencing characteristics of the two <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> modes have potential to achieve optical detection independent of external perturbation, such as temperature change...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{technique}} {{based on}} <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> on microring structures, plasmon resonance and identiﬁcation tools has been developed. Experimental data on detection and identiﬁcation of variety of biochemical agents, such as proteins, microelements, antibiotics of diﬀerent generation etc. in both single and multicomponent solutions analyzed {{on the light}} scattering of whispering gallery mode <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> are represented. Multiplexing on parameters and components has been realized using developed ﬂuidic sensor cell with ﬁxed in adhesive layer dielectric microspheres and data processing. To improve sensitivity of microring structures microspheres had been treated previously by gold nanoparticle solution. Another technique included usage of thin ﬁlm gold layers deposited on the substrate below adhesive. Both biomolecule and nanoparticle injections cause considerable changes of <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> spectra. Plasmonic gold layers under optimized thickness also improve parameters of <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> spectra. Biochemical component identiﬁcation has been performed by developed network analysis techniques. Proposed approach is demonstrated to be applicable both for single agent and for multicomponent biochemical analysis.

30|$|The tapered {{nanowire}} displayed colors ranging {{throughout the}} visible spectrum between the clamped and loose ends {{when it is}} observed under a dark-field microscopy (Fig.  7 b) [48, 49]. Given that the dark-field microscopy has the optimum capability to detect only scattered light, as such the emitted colors of the collected light solely comes from the light scattered by the tapered nanowire. In addition, Ramos et al. reported that numerical simulations from their studies of light-silicon nanowire interaction demonstrated that silicon nanowires display <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> that competently improve the light scattering for a specific wavelength values to diameter ratio. These <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> created {{a connection between the}} diameter of the tapered nanowire and the scattered light’s color {{similar to that of the}} dark-field data [45].|$|R
40|$|A {{dielectric}} microsphere {{in a lower}} {{refractive index}} medium exhibits sharp <b>optical</b> <b>resonances,</b> called whispering gallery modes. These are sensitive probes of refractive index changes near the sphere surface and can be thus exploited for biosensing applications. Using evanescent field coupling via frustrated total internal reflection, we measured whispering gallery <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> of polystyrene microspheres of 30 - 45 mum diameter, held in aqueous buffer by optical tweezers, and found Q-factors of up to 4 times 106. We also demonstrated a monolithic sensor based on polystyrene microspheres in water attached onto an optical coupler via a solid separation layer index matched to water. As a proof of principle of the sensing capabilities, we measured the response to refractive index changes and inferred a shot-noise limited precision of 1 times 10 - 8 refractive index units...|$|R
50|$|Additional <b>optical</b> <b>{{resonances}}</b> are guided-mode resonances {{and surface}} plasmon resonance, which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are usually excited by a subwavelength grating.|$|R
40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>resonance</b> {{modes of}} micro-scale {{patterned}} InGaN quantum wells including disks and rings of various diameters (0. 5 - 20 m) have been investigated. For {{the observation of}} resonant modes, well-defined features and striation-free sidewalls were essential. Each of the patterned structures displayed resonant modes superimposed on the main InGaN photoluminescence peak. The large number of such modes observed has allowed analysis of the mode spacing {{as a function of}} both wavelength and diameter. Comparison with a simple model has confirmed that these are whispering gallery modes. No evidence of radial modes was observed. Microrings showed fewer <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> modes than microdisks. In addition, the number of observable modes correlated with the width of microring structures...|$|E
40|$|The lock {{acquisition}} {{scheme for}} the Advanced LIGO optical configuration, which {{makes use of}} "resonant sideband extraction", is under investigation in the 40 meter prototype interferometer at Caltech. The 40 m has a similar optical configuration to the one planned for Advanced LIGO which has 5 degrees of freedom for length control. So far we have succeeded in locking the 5 degrees of freedom routinely. The differential mode of arm cavities was locked in the same state as the final setup, and the peak of <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> was verified to be around 4 kHz. Currently, since an offset remains in the common mode of the arm cavities, another <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> {{can be seen in}} common mode optical gain...|$|E

Several antibiotics of different generations: Amox-icillin, Azithromycin, Cephazolin, Chloramphenicol, Levofloxacin, Lincomicin Benzylpenicillin, Riphampicon both in deionized water and physiological solution had been used for measurements. Both spectral shift {{and the structure of}} resonance spectra were of specific interest in this investigation. Drag identification has been performed by developed multilayer perceptron network. The network topology was designed included: a number of the hidden layers of multilayered perceptron, a number of neurons in each of layers, a method of training of a neural network, activation functions of layers, type and size of a deviation of the received values from required values. For a network training the method of the back propagation error in various modifications has been used. Input vectors correspond to 6 classes of biological substances under investigation. The result of classification was considered as positive when each of the region, representing a certain substance in a space: relative spectral shift of an <b>optical</b> <b>resonance</b> maxima – relative efficiency of excitation of WGM, was singly connected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{characteristic}} of femtosecond pulse scattering on small particles is the temporal {{separation of the}} pulses, {{which is due to}} the different optical path lengths through the particle. Therefore the particle converts the incident pulse in a train of pulses, with the pulse heights and temporal separation depending on particle size, refractive index and observation angle. Because of the temporal pulse separation, signal parts from different scattering orders are no longer coherent. Therefore interference structures, which are in the case of continuous illumination the cause of scattering lobes, disappear. The interference inside a single scattering order, as for the rainbow, exists as long as the pulses from different paths overlap. The detection does not require high temporal resolution but is time integrated. This offers the possibility to improve or extend techniques which are disturbed by additional scattering orders, as the rainbow technique for small particles. A second {{characteristic of}} femtosecond pulses is the broad electromagnetic spectrum of the illumination. For continuous laser illumination with one spectral line, a spherical particle generates <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> for various wavelength-diameter ratios (morphology dependent <b>resonances,</b> MDRs). These <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> increase the <b>optical</b> cross-section of the particle and generate strong oscillations in the diameter-intensity relation. Because the power of a pulse is distributed over several spectral lines, which generally do not fulfill the resonant conditions at the same time, the influence of <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> i...|$|R

30|$|Ramos et al. {{in order}} to {{investigate}} more on the <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> of the tapered nanowire, at a wavelength of 633  nm, the scattering efficiency of the nanowire was calculated {{as a function of}} its diameter that is depicted in Fig.  7 b for transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) azimuthal polarizations [45]. The spectra illustrated a series of <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> indicating the location of strong scattering of light while the light limitation within the nanowire is been demonstrated by the spatial distribution of the near electric-field intensity at these resonances (Fig.  7 b). It should be noted that there is a generation of evanescent field resulting from the electromagnetic field extending some few nanometers away from the nanowire because of the small size of the nanowire and thus the resonances can proficiently relate with the neighboring electromagnetic field [50].|$|R
40|$|International audienceDielectric optical thin films, {{as opposed}} to metallic, have been very sparsely {{explored}} as good candidates for absorption-based optical field enhancement. In such materials, the low imaginary part of the refractive index implies that absorption processes are usually not predominant. This leads to dielectric-based <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> mainly via waveguiding modes. We show here that when properly designed, a multi-layered dielectric thin films stack can give rise to <b>optical</b> <b>resonances</b> linked to total absorption. We report here, on such dielectric stack designed to possess a theoretical optical field enhancement above 1000. Using photon scanning tunneling microscopy, we experimentally evaluate the resulting field enhancement of the stack {{as well as the}} associated penetration depth.
