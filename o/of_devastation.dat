5|$|Amonkhet has The Gatewatch set out {{to destroy}} the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after {{learning}} of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour <b>of</b> <b>Devastation,</b> Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast between life and death.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused a swath <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> {{stretching from the}} Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were knocked over, obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region. Cold temperatures, wet snow, and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred cattle. In general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following {{the passage of the}} snow hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|The French king, Henry II, {{proposed}} to unite France and Scotland by marrying the young queen to his three-year-old son, the Dauphin Francis. On {{the promise of}} French military help, and a French dukedom for himself, Arran agreed to the marriage. In February 1548, Mary was moved, again for her safety, to Dumbarton Castle. The English left a trail <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> behind once more and seized the strategic town of Haddington. In June, the much awaited French help arrived at Leith to besiege and ultimately take Haddington. On 7 July 1548, a Scottish Parliament held at a nunnery near the town agreed to a French marriage treaty.|$|E

5|$|Following this disaster, Sayf al-Dawla {{needed time}} to recover his strength, {{but as soon as}} Nikephoros Phokas {{returned}} victorious from Crete in summer 961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, they suddenly appeared before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it {{took more}} than 24hours for word of the level <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> to reach {{officials}} in Manila as communications across Leyte were largely destroyed. By November7, search and rescue operations were underway across Leyte and Negros Occidental. The first shipment of relief supplies, consisting of food rations, rice, sardines, and used clothing, was to be shipped from Cebu later that day. On November8, Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. A Philippine Navy vessel set out with heavy earth-moving machinery and the Philippine Air Force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts. Relief efforts in Ormoc City were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel. Amateur radio reports stated that an AC-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked. Relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region. By November11, approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{fleet and}} army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp {{out the last}} embers of the revolt. They {{attacked}} and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels. They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king's harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities. While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale <b>of</b> <b>devastation.</b> In a few years, the cities had more-or-less returned to normal {{and they were able}} to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece, just 13 years later.|$|E

5|$|During the 1929 {{stock market}} crash and {{subsequent}} economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the United Nations was chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> that occurred over the past decade, and on September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled.|$|E

25|$|Although wind speeds were extreme, {{the major}} cause of damage and loss of life {{appears to have been}} storm surge.

Philippine Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming, with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris.|$|E

25|$|These points {{represent}} {{the bright side}} of Tatar rule, but it also had its dark side. So long as a great horde of nomads was encamped on the frontier, the country was liable to be invaded by an overwhelming force. Fortunately, these invasions were not frequent, but when they occurred they caused an incalculable amount <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> and suffering. In the intervals the people had to pay a fixed tribute. At first it was collected in a rough-and-ready fashion by Tatar tax-gatherers; by about 1259 it was regulated by a census of the population; and finally its collection was entrusted to the native princes, so the people were no longer brought into {{direct contact with the}} Tatar officials.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{economy was}} {{devastated by the}} war, with {{factories}} and bridges destroyed, cattle and raw materials pillaged, mines flooded and machines damaged. The droughts of 1920 and 1921, {{as well as the}} 1921 famine, worsened the disaster still further. Disease had reached pandemic proportions, with 3,000,000 dying of typhus alone in 1920. Millions more also died of widespread starvation. By 1922 there were at least 7,000,000 street children in Russia as a result of nearly ten years <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> from the Great War and the civil war. Another one to two million people, known as the White émigrés, fled Russia, many with Gen. Wrangel—some through the Far East, others west into the newly independent Baltic countries.

25|$|Meitei {{literature}} is the literature {{written in the}} Meitei language (Manipuri, Meiteilon), including literature composed in Meitei by writers from Manipur, Assam, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The history of Meitei literature trace back to thousands of years with flourish of its civilization. The survival of the literature after passing through the massive devastation, the terror event of history, by burning of Meitei scriptures, which is known as Puya Meithaba, was a miracle. The resilience that Meiteis could acquire in the event <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> proved her ability to survive in history. Most of the early literary works found in Meitei literature were in poetry and prose. Some of the books were written with combination of both the prose and poetry. One {{of the most famous}} Meitei writers of the twentieth century is M. K. Binodini Devi.|$|E
25|$|Wren {{had been}} {{involved}} in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for St Paul's. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the Great Fire of London reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September he ascertained the precise area <b>of</b> <b>devastation,</b> worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A rebuilding act which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1667. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.|$|E
25|$|The Siege of Port Arthur {{commenced}} in April 1904. Japanese troops tried numerous frontal {{assaults on}} the fortified hilltops overlooking the harbour, which were defeated with Japanese {{casualties in the}} thousands. Eventually, though, {{with the aid of}} several batteries of 11-inch (280mm) Krupp howitzers, the Japanese were able to capture the key hilltop bastion in December 1904. From this vantage point, the long-range artillery was able to shell the Russian fleet, which was unable to retaliate effectively against the land-based artillery and was unable or unwilling to sail out against the blockading fleet. Four Russian battleships and two cruisers were sunk in succession, with the fifth and last battleship being forced to scuttle a few weeks later. Thus, all capital ships of the Russian fleet in the Pacific were sunk. This is probably the only example in military history when such a scale <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> was achieved by land-based artillery against major warships.|$|E

25|$|The war had {{profound}} consequences on {{the health}} of soldiers. Of the 60million European military personnel who were mobilized from 1914 to 1918, 8million were killed, 7million were permanently disabled, and 15million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%. In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, {{due in large part to}} food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000people in Lebanon. Between 5 and 10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921. By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade <b>of</b> <b>devastation</b> from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920–1922. Numerous anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by the 1930s, the northern Chinese city of Harbin had 100,000Russians. Thousands more emigrated to France, England, and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Owing to the Ottoman Empire's {{expansion}} into Hungarian territory, Bratislava was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, {{ahead of the}} old Hungarian capital of Buda falling in 1541. It {{become part of the}} Austrian Habsburg monarchy, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. The territory comprising modern Slovakia, then known as Upper Hungary, became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the Magyar nobility fleeing the Turks and far more linguistically and culturally Hungarian than it was before. Partly thanks to old Hussite families, and Slovaks studying under Martin Luther, the region then experienced a growth in Protestants. For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were Lutherans. They defied the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighboring Transylvania, a rival continuation of the Magyar state that practiced religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent border wars and changes to the frontier, which was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by German and Italian troops on the Habsburg side. The Ottoman wars, rivalry between Austria and Transylvania, and the frequent insurrections against the Habsburg Monarchy inflicted a great deal <b>of</b> <b>devastation,</b> especially in the rural areas. In the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664) a Turkish army led by the Grand Vizier decimated Slovakia. Even so, Slovaks from the Principality of Upper Hungary fought alongside the Turks against the Austrians at the Battle of Vienna of 1683. As the Turks withdrew from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although Pressburg retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848, when it was transferred back to Buda.|$|E
