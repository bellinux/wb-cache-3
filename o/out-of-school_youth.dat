2500|$|France Castro, the {{secretary}} of Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), stated {{that there is a}} grave need to address the alarming number of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youth</b> in the country. The Philippines overall has 1.4 million children who are out-of-school, according to UNESCO's data, and is additionally the only ASEAN country that is included in the top 5 countries with the highest number of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youth.</b> In 2012, the Department of Education showed data of a 6.38% drop-out rate in primary school and a 7.82% drop-out rate in secondary school. Castro further stated that [...] "the increasing number of out-of-school children is being caused by poverty. The increases in the price of oil, electricity, rice, water, and other basic commodities are further pushing the poor into dire poverty." [...] Subsequently, as more families become poorer, the number of students enrolled in public schools increases, especially in the high school level. In 2013, the Department of Education estimated that there are 38, 503 elementary schools alongside 7,470 high schools.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cameroon {{has a high}} {{concentration}} of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths.</b> Therefore research relating to out-of-school adolescents and HIV/AIDS is imperative. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the perception of risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and its association with multiple sexual partners among <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths</b> in Kumba, the Southwest region of Cameroon. A cross sectional study was adopted using a self-administered pretested questionnaire to collect data from a multistage probability sample of 405 consenting (208 male and 197 female) <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths,</b> aged 15 - 24 years in July 2013. Chi square statistics were calculated using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 at the level 0. 05. Only few <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths,</b> 84 (20. 7 %) perceived themselves at high risk of contracting HIV. Of the sexually active respondents, the majority, 129 (57. 3 %) reported having had multiple sexual partners in the last one year before this study, and 62 (27. 7 %) reported having multiple concurrent sexual partners at the time of this study. Sexually active respondents who agreed that having multiple sexual partners is a sexual risk behaviour were less likely to have had multiple sequential sexual partners in the one year preceding this study than those who disagreed (p= 0. 022). <b>Out-of-school</b> <b>youths</b> manifested low perception of risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, with youths having low perception, likely to engage in multiple sexual partnerships, and therefore are at high risk of HIV/AIDS transmission.

40|$|Ethiopia is a {{developing}} country with a demographic profile dominated by a young population. Due to biological, psychological, sociocultural and economic factors, young people, particularly those aged 15 – 24 years, are generally at {{a high risk of}} HIV/AIDS and other reproductive health problems. This paper presents results of a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in Bahir Dar town, northwest Ethiopia, to assess factors that predispose <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths</b> to HIV/AIDS-related risk behaviours. Both quantitative and qualitative data-collection methods were employed to conduct the study. For quantitative data collection, a household interview survey was conducted among 628 <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths,</b> aged 15 – 24 years, within the 17 kebeles (villages) of the town. The number of respondents in each kebeles was assigned proportional to the size of kebeles, and the required numbers of respondents within each kebeles were selected through a systematic random-sampling technique. Qualitative data were collected by conducting five focus-group discussions with 46 participants and in-depth interviews with 10 participants. Institutional ethical clearance and informed verbal consent from the study participants were obtained before undertaking the study. Of the 628 study subjects, 64. 8 % had experienced sexual intercourse {{at the time of the}} survey. The mean age at first sexual commencement was 17. 7 (+ 2) years. Of those sexually active, 33 % had sexual intercourse with non-regular partners (the proportions were 40. 6 % among males and 24. 7 % among females, suggesting that males tended to be about two times more likely to have sex with non-regular sexual partners than females (odds ratio= 1. 78, with 95 % confidence interval 1. 16 − 2. 73). Furthermore, consistent condom-use among those who had sex in exchange for money was low (36 %). Alcohol intake, chewing of khat (a green leaf), low educational background, and being male were significantly associated with having sex with either a commercial or a non-regular sexual partner. In view of the magnitude of high-risk sexual behaviours among <b>out-of-school</b> <b>youths</b> that may expose them to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, efforts need to be exerted to deal with the identified predisposing factors and to address the problems of idleness, lack of jobs, and hopelessness...|$|R
