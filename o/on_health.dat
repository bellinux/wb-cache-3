Behavior {{was a result}} of internal and external factors such as stimulus and response. Many factors can affect of children behavior <b>on</b> oral <b>health</b> maintenance. This study aims is to identify factors affecting children behavior <b>on</b> oral <b>health</b> maintenance. The study is an observational research with a cross sectional design and all that met inclusion criteria were sampled. Questionnaires with Likert scale were used to assess attitudes, perception, motivation, and behavior variables. The questionnaires showed validity (correlation values ≥ 0. 30) and reliability (alpha Cronbach ≥ 0. 70). The result of multiple regression analysis showed that variables attitude (p = 0. 163) did not affect significantly on the behavior. Variables perception (p = 0. 017) and motivation (p = 0. 006) affected significantly on the behavior. Variables of perception and motivation contribute 40. 0 % (R 2 = 0. 400) to children behavior <b>on</b> oral <b>health</b> maintenance. Motivation gave the highest contribution of 10. 4 % to children behavior <b>on</b> oral <b>health</b> maintenance.
