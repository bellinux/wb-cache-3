25|$|As {{they entered}} their {{game against the}} Marion Military Institute, many of the Alabama {{supporters}} viewed the game against the Cadets as just a practice game before their anticipated match-up against Sewanee. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Alabama defeated the Cadets 61–0 at Tuscaloosa for their fourth consecutive shutout to open the season. Touchdowns in the game were scored three times by J. H. Emmett, twice each by Charles Bartlett and Mullie Lenoir, and one apiece by Walter E. Hovater and Morgan. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Marion to 6–0.|$|E
25|$|A mistake, however, {{prevented}} {{the move to}} the club: when the contract had been agreed, Dalglish realised {{they did not have}} the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and the office had been locked up for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on the Saturday and signed for Manchester United for £3.75million, a British transfer record at the time.|$|E

25|$|In {{their only}} home {{game of the}} season, the Baby Tide ran for 359 yards and six touchdowns {{en route to a}} 41–7 win over Vanderbilt <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The next week, Alabama rallied from a 15-point deficit and {{defeated}} Tulane 23–22 at New Orleans. After Danny Ridgeway gave the Baby Tide an early 7–0 lead, Tulane responded with the next 22 points and opened a 22–7 lead. Green Wave points were scored on a 43-yard Steve Foley touchdown pass to Robert Johnson, a one-yard Foley touchdown run, a 50-yard John Washington punt return and on a 31-yard David Falgue field goal. Alabama then rallied for the 23–22 victory behind a pair of Bob Holmes touchdown runs and a pair of Ralph Stokes two-point conversions in the fourth quarter.|$|E

500|$|During {{filming of}} the pilot episode, Whedon was still arguing with Fox that the show should be {{displayed}} in widescreen format. Consequently, he purposely filmed scenes with actors on the extreme edge of both sides {{so that they could}} only be shown in widescreen. This led to a few scenes on the DVD (and later Blu-ray) where objects or setups that were not visible in the original 4:3 broadcasts were now displayed—such as the scene in the pilot where Wash mimes controlling the ship with a non-existent yoke. However, the pilot was rejected by the Fox executives, who felt that it lacked action and that the captain was too [...] "dour". They also disliked a scene in which the crew backed down to a crime boss, since the scene implied the crew was [...] "being nothing". Thus, Fox told Whedon <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> that he had to submit a new pilot script on Monday morning or the show would not be picked up. Whedon and Tim Minear closeted themselves for the weekend to write what became the new pilot, [...] "The Train Job". At the direction of Fox, they added [...] "larger than life" [...] characters such as the henchman [...] "Crow", and the [...] "hands of blue" [...] men, who also introduced an X-Files-type ending.|$|E

40|$|Workflow, loosely defined, is {{the set of}} tasks—grouped {{chronologically}} into processes—and the set {{of people}} or resources needed for those tasks, {{that are necessary to}} accomplish a given goal. An organization’s workflow is comprised of the set of processes it needs to accomplish, the set of people or other resources available to perform those processes, and the interactions among them. Consider the following scenario: <b>On</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> in the emergency room, as one nurse prepares to go off shift, the clerk looks up from the desk and asks, “By the way, since you’re passing by housekeeping on your way out, would you remind them that room 12 still needs to be cleaned?” “No problem, ” replies the nurse, and indeed, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> it is no problem. The informal methods and processes that the hospital has developed over the years to keep the enterprise humming work well, in general, and can work very well in optimal times. It’s no trouble to remind housekeeping to come up; it’s no trouble to run a special specimen down to the lab, and certainly no trouble to catch the attending physician during rounds to get a quick signature...|$|R

50|$|Despite these similarities, several {{investigators}} initially doubted whether Harper's murder {{should be}} linked to the series due to the differences in the circumstances of her abduction {{and the fact that the}} child had been subjected to a serious sexual assault prior to her murder, whereas decomposition had erased any such clear traces on the bodies of the two previous victims. Harper had been abducted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rainy Wednesday evening from a suburb in the north of England, wearing a hooded anorak covering much of her face, as opposed to being abducted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> summer <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> in southern Scotland while wearing summer clothing. Investigators remained open-minded as to whether Harper's murder had been committed by the same person, and telephone and computer connections were established between the incident room in the Leeds district of Holbeck and Leith. Harper's murder was formally linked to the series in November 1986.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{this year}} I taught a {{resource}} management unit {{as part of}} the Master of Education degree at Monash University. The unit focused on the concept of sustainability as it applies not only to wealth creation and ecological sustainability but to human sustainability in terms of community and social well-being. Or as this is more commonly referred to, ‘work/life balance’. The term came into use during the late 1980 s to describe the maintenance of a balance between the responsibilities a person has at work and at home (Benveniste in Dunphy, Benveniste, Griffiths and Sutton 2000). Being involved in that unit of teaching got me thinking about how the work/life balance is experienced by self employed consultants or contractors, because I was certainly not a good example of managing it well. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> sunny Good <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> I was sitting at my computer marking 52 essays describing how the work/life balance was addressed by my students without realising the irony of my situation…. where was my balance and why wasn’t I practicing what I preach?

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, many animal shelters have {{employed}} behavior evaluations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> selection of canines prior to their adoption to (1) more accurately match the canine with the owner / family and (2) to reduce the probability that canines displaying aggression will not be placed up for adoption. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study was}} to (1) determine how successful canines were after completing the behavior test with being adopted and (2) if canines were returned to the shelter if reasons given related to an aggressive citation by the new owner. This study was performed at the Animal Rescue League (ARL) of Iowa, located in Ankeny, IA. All canine behavior evaluations were conducted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> weekly basis (<b>Friday</b> <b>afternoons)</b> from the last week of January through the first week of April 2009. A standardized form for all canine behavior evaluations was used. The canine adoption information was collected on three separate occasions; April 1 st, 22 nd and 29 th, 2009. The program used to find adoption information was PetPoint. A total of 41 canines were observed. Thirty-three canines were successfully adopted (87 %) and five were adopted but returned (13 %). Of these five canines returned, only one (20 %) reason noted “aggression towards cat. ” In conclusion, the majority of canines that underwent and passed the behavior evaluation were successful in their adoption. Furthermore, of the five canines returned after being placed for adoption, only one was linked to some form of aggression...|$|R

60|$|We {{will now}} follow its {{fortunes}} {{for a short}} while, and explain how it was that Mary received no answer for a week; a week, {{it may well be}} imagined, of terrible suspense to her. When she took it to the post-office, she doubtless thought that the baker's wife had nothing to do but to send it up to the house at Greshamsbury, and that Frank would receive it that evening, or, at latest, early on the following morning. But this was by no means so. The epistle was posted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and it behoved the baker's wife to send it into Silverbridge--Silverbridge being the post-town--so that all due formalities, as ordered by the Queen's Government, might there be perfected. Now, unfortunately, the post-boy had taken his departure before Mary reached the shop, and it was not, therefore, dispatched till Saturday. Sunday was always a dies non with the Greshamsbury Mercury, and, consequently, Frank's letter was not delivered at the house till Monday morning; at which time Mary had for two long days been waiting with weary heart for the expected answer.|$|E

6000|$|Nanda Brookenham, for a {{fortnight}} after Mr. Longdon's return, had found much to think of; but {{the bustle of}} business became, visibly for us, particularly great with her <b>on</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>Friday</b> <b>afternoon</b> in June. She was in unusual possession of that chamber of comfort in which so much of her life had lately been passed, the redecorated and rededicated room upstairs {{in which she had}} enjoyed a due measure both of solitude and of society. Passing the objects about her in review she gave especial attention to her rather marked wealth of books; changed repeatedly, for five minutes, the position of various volumes, transferred to tables those that were on shelves and rearranged shelves with an eye to the effect of backs. She was flagrantly engaged throughout indeed in the study of effect, which moreover, had the law of an extreme freshness not inveterately prevailed there, might have been observed to be traceable in the very detail of her own appearance. [...] "Company" [...] in short was in the air and expectation in the picture. The flowers on the little tables bloomed with a consciousness sharply taken up by the glitter of nick-nacks and reproduced in turn in the light exuberance of cushions on sofas and the measured drop of blinds in windows. The numerous photographed friends in particular were highly prepared, with small intense faces, each, that happened in every case to be turned to the door. The pair of eyes most dilated perhaps was that of old Van, present under a polished glass and in a frame of gilt-edged morocco that spoke out, across the room, of Piccadilly and Christmas, and visibly widening his gaze {{at the opening of the}} door, at the announcement of a name by a footman and at the entrance of a gentleman remarkably like him save as the resemblance was on the gentleman's part flattered. Vanderbank had not been in the room ten seconds before he showed ever so markedly that he had arrived to be kind. Kindness therefore becomes for us, by a quick turn of the glass that reflects the whole scene, the high pitch of the concert--a kindness that almost immediately filled the place, to the exclusion of everything else, with a familiar friendly voice, a brightness of good looks and good intentions, a constant though perhaps sometimes misapplied laugh, a superabundance almost of interest, inattention and movement.|$|R
