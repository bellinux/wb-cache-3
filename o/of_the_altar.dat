5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b> The carving on the upper face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E
5|$|Before the Protestant Reformation, the {{crucifix}} was common in Western Christianity. It {{is a model}} of the cross with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches until recent times.|$|E

50|$|Epitaphs on funerary altars {{provide much}} {{information}} about the deceased, most often including their name and their filiation or tribe. Less often, the age and profession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased {{was included in the}} epitaph. A typical epitaph on a Roman funerary altar opens with a dedication to the manes, or <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, and closes with a word <b>of</b> praise for <b>the</b> honoree. These epitaphs, along with <b>the</b> pictorial attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altars,</b> allow historians to discern a lot of important information about ancient Roman funerary practices and monuments. Gathered from <b>the</b> funerary <b>altars,</b> it can be established that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altars</b> were erected by a homogeneous group of middle-class citizens.|$|R
5|$|On {{the left}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> {{opposite}} it, houses {{an image of a}} unidentified saint on the topmost level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna and Child) in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church houses an original wooden iconostasis in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b> Carved {{in the second half}} of the 14th century, the iconostasis has a basic shape. It is constructed of thick beams and wooden boards, on which traces of painting are visible, and has three openings.|$|E
50|$|A late 16th-century fresco <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Matryrdom <b>of</b> St. Lawrence {{serves as}} <b>the</b> reredos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high <b>altar</b> and was painted by Pasquale Cati, a pupil <b>of</b> Michelangelo. <b>The</b> {{crucifix}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high <b>altar</b> is from <b>the</b> 14th century.|$|R
5|$|Located to <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>altar</b> is <b>the</b> side <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sacred Heart.

5|$|Altar 4 is a {{circular}} monument. It {{was also found}} {{in the northern part of}} the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4. It depicts three seated prisoners, the central figure is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him. Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b> The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{thoroughly}} renovated in 1631 by Thomas Lyte, who installed the arch-braced-collar truss roof, the communion rail, a rear screen and a frieze below the roof painted with {{the arms of}} the Lytes and their relations. A monument to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> records Thomas' work on the chapel. In 1912 Sir Walter Jenner added the stained glass, including medieval glass said to have come from Charlton Mackrell church which William Le Lyte had commissioned before his death in 1316.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry to}} the vestry {{is located at the}} end of the right side aisle next to the choir; {{at the end of the}} left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> and is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> and above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.|$|E

Dying, <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> golden vampires stumbles and collapses into a vat of boiling blood, where it quickly evaporates, leaving behind the bat-like medallion, its mask, a pile of dried blood, and red dust.|$|R
40|$|During {{the fourteenth}} and fifteenth centuries many lay groups and {{individuals}} in Western Europe founded side altars and chapels in <b>the</b> parish churches <b>of</b> their towns. For this article, five town parish churches in the Northern Netherlands were selected {{to carry out a}} survey of altar patterns in their interiors on <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> Iconoclasm and Protestant Reformation, c. 1550 : the St. Stephen in Nijmegen, the Buurkerk in Utrecht, the St. Bavo in Haarlem, the Old Church in Amsterdam and the St. John in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. The aim was to assess to what extent <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> topography <b>of</b> medieval churches can be read as a ‘liturgical window’ on the socio-economic and cultural dynamics of latemedieval cities. In order to achieve this, the historical context was first analyzed, including some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towns, <b>the</b> social positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lay groups, their use <b>of</b> liturgy and <b>the</b> <b>altars,</b> <b>the</b> relations between the lay groups and specific saints, <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altars</b> in <b>the</b> churches and the relations between the lay people and the clergy. This article brings together <b>the</b> ground plans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings and <b>the</b> <b>altars</b> they contained, as well as additional sources such as foundational charters, descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altars</b> and their saints. Among <b>the</b> founders/users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altars,</b> six categories are distinguished, and their relations made visible. In their ‘altar patterns’ the five selected churches reveal great differences between the towns where they were located. This method involving altar patterns as a mirror of cultural dynamics offers great opportunities for <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> medieval urban dynamics of Western Europe...|$|R

5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable a more intimate celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E
5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E

5|$|None of {{his three}} sons became {{involved}} in their father's work and the business was wound up by administrators. The sons created a memorial to their parents in St Erasmus' Chapel in Chester cathedral. This consists of a backcloth to the altar inscribed to their parents' memory, and a bust of their father to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar.</b> The memorial is by Sir Arthur Blomfield and the bust by M. Wagmiller. There is also a bust of Thomas in Chester's Grosvenor Museum and plaques to his memory in Chester station. Streets named after him in Chester are Brassey Street and Thomas Brassey Close (which is off Lightfoot Street).|$|E
5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar)</b> is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Though an {{absentee}} landlord, Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, regarded the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E
50|$|Four doors surmounted by a {{pediment}} {{and framed}} by travertine columns with Corinthian capitals are distributed between <b>the</b> main <b>altar</b> and <b>the</b> side chapels. Four large arches rise at <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two main axes, framing <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> entry, <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> and <b>the</b> two chapels. <b>The</b> sacred area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>altar</b> is a square enclosed by four arches as a clear counterpoint to <b>the</b> oval part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.|$|R
25|$|The 1980 {{earthquake}} caused {{extensive damage}} to the building.

5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, {{to the left of the}} north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E
5|$|In 1633, Charles {{appointed}} William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury. Together, {{they began}} a series of anti-Calvinist reforms that attempted to ensure religious uniformity by restricting non-conformist preachers, insisting that the liturgy be celebrated as prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer, organising the internal architecture of English churches so as to emphasise the sacrament <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar,</b> and re-issuing King James's Declaration of Sports, which permitted secular activities on the sabbath. The Feoffees for Impropriations, an organisation that bought benefices and advowsons so that Puritans could be appointed to them, was dissolved. To prosecute those who opposed his reforms, Laud used the two most powerful courts in the land, the Court of High Commission and the Court of Star Chamber. The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views, and became unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen. For example, in 1637 William Prynne, Henry Burton and John Bastwick were pilloried, whipped and mutilated by cropping and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti-episcopal pamphlets.|$|E
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>altar</b> and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south.
