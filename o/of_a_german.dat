5|$|On 22 June, Germany {{launched}} a massive attack upon the Soviet Union; this attack all but removed the threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> {{invasion of the}} United Kingdom. However, the British still had to consider the threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> invasion due {{the possibility that the}} Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west. In late 1941, the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant that the threat of invasion subsided. This, coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army, allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half. As part of this reform, the County Divisions were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Lord Nelson became flagship of the Channel Fleet and was based at Portland.

On 14 November, she transferred to Sheerness to guard the English coast against the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> invasion.

On 14 August, Belfast took part in her first exercise, Operation Hipper, in which she played the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> commerce raider attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous Pentland Firth, Belfast successfully evaded the Home Fleet.|$|E

He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 of his men out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> encirclement to safety without a single casualty.

He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E

5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and {{it was hoped that}} Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

At the outbreak of war he was stationed on the Franco–German border flying uneventful patrols. He was then posted as a flight instructor stationed in Romania as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> military mission training Romanian pilots.

5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> villain, Dr. Müller, who {{would go on to}} become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E

Its population increased from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and reached 1.6 million by 1941.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, {{following}} the Second World War's Battle of France, the United Kingdom was {{under threat of}} invasion from Germany. During the summer, the Battle of Britain dampened this threat. As the year progressed, {{the size of the}} British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised. During October, with the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> invasion during 1941, these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then assigned to newly created County Divisions.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>German</b> liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
