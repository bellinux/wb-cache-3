5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a man <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months. The {{government}} quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to entertain the troops and the general public than serving, whether suitable or not, in the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{governmental}} career, Gale was {{a member}} of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society, where he served as treasurer. Gale was known as a collector of manuscripts and other antiquarian items, writing a few published works on those subjects. He donated his manuscript collection to his alma mater in 1738, and died in 1744. Although contemporaries felt he was one of the foremost scholars <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> later historians have been less convinced, contrasting his learning unfavourably with his father's.|$|E

5|$|He {{said that}} he {{understood}} my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> to do? They were not likely to {{live to see the}} ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Henry Ward Beecher {{was the son}} of Lyman Beecher, a Calvinist {{minister}} who became one of the best-known evangelists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b> Several of his brothers and sisters became well-known educators and activists, most notably Harriet Beecher Stowe, who achieved worldwide fame with her abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Henry Ward Beecher graduated from Amherst College in 1834 and Lane Theological Seminary in 1837 before serving as a minister in Indianapolis and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.|$|E

Dunstan attempted to win both the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{commissioned}} the leading Italian artists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti {{to direct the}} rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsvár, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fejéregyháza.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of 100% Love (2011), Akkineni Nagarjuna decided to act and produce in an all-star film along with his father, actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and elder son Naga Chaitanya. Nageswara Rao {{suggested}} Nagarjuna to begin the film as early as possible, because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b> After examining and rejecting many scripts due to a perceived lack of novelty, Nagarjuna was advised by actor Nithin's father and distributor Sudhakar Reddy {{to listen to a}} script by Vikram Kumar, who was directing Nithin and Nithya Menen in Ishq (2012). Although he liked the script after the first narration, he agreed to act in the film only after watching Ishq before its theatrical release.|$|E

Mick is 85 years old, and unlike other vampires, he has standards and does not hunt women, children, or innocents. Although he realizes that he has feelings for Beth, he is reluctant to continue a romantic relationship with her, knowing that being a vampire would hinder any sort of normal life. He is shown to be unusually mature and physically strong for a vampire <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he had not}} {{sought the}} office and was not old enough to serve, Breckinridge was elected to {{represent}} Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780.

His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.|$|E
5|$|An {{apprentice}} boilermaker {{before the}} war, Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 {{and worked as}} a gardener. In 1932, he published Hell's Bells and Mademoiselles, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his war experiences. Attempting to enlist for service during the Second World War, Maxwell was rejected on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> before enlisting under an alias in Queensland; his identity was discovered, and after a short period in a training position, he sought discharge. In 1967, aged 71, he died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was {{nominated}} to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests {{that he was more}} than a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b> He {{became a member of the}} Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C.

He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company.

However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 1275 – 23 June 1324) was a Franco-English nobleman. Though {{primarily}} {{active in}} England, {{he also had}} strong connections with the French royal house. One of the wealthiest and most powerful men <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> he was a central player in the conflicts between Edward II of England and his nobility, particularly Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. Pembroke {{was one of the}} Lords Ordainers appointed to restrict the power of Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston. His position changed with the great insult he suffered when Gaveston, as a prisoner in his custody whom he had sworn to protect, was removed and beheaded on the instigation of Lancaster. This led Pembroke into close and lifelong cooperation with the King. Later in life, however, political circumstances combined with financial difficulties would cause him problems, driving him away from the centre of power.|$|E

The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung reported: 'The amazing keyboard playing of young Bär (a Jewish lad of 9), who carried off the difficult passages and other solo parts with aplomb, and has fine powers of rendition even more rarely found in one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> made the concert even more interesting'.|$|E
