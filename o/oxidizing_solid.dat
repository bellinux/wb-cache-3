The reaction was carried out in a packed-bed reactor under continuous or pulsed flows of methane. Oxidation utilized oxide oxygen and was initially very fast but slowed down as the oxide support became progressively reduced. Addition of ZrO_ 2 into CeO_ 2 considerably increased the rate of methane oxidation and enhanced the reducibility of CeO_ 2 but decreased the selectivity to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Specifically it was found that significant production of carbon dioxide and water occurred on the freshly <b>oxidized</b> <b>solid</b> until a certain degree of reduction was reached beyond which the selectivity to carbon monoxide and hydrogen rose to over 90 %. This critical degree of reduction was 10 %, 40 % and 65 % for the solid compositions x = 0, 0. 2 and 0. 5, respectively. Additional experiments carried out using carbon monoxide pulses showed that carbon monoxide oxidation declines sharply and becomes negligible beyond this degree of reduction while oxidation of methane continues much further.

The evolutions of the intensities of the IR bands of each adsorbed species: 2045 cm- 1 and 2000 cm- 1 at 300 K, for the linear and bridged CO species, respectively, on Ag 0 sites of the reduced solid and 2168 cm- 1 for a linear CO species on Ag+ sites of the <b>oxidized</b> <b>solid</b> are determined {{as a function of}} the adsorption temperature Ta, at a constant CO adsorption pressure PCO. This provides the evolutions of the coverages of each adsorbed CO species with Ta in isobar conditions that give the individual heats of adsorption of the three adsorbed CO species at several coverages according to an adsorption model. The heats of adsorption of the linear and bridged adsorbed CO species on Ag 0 sites vary linearly with their coverages : from E 0 = 76 kJ/mol to E 1 = 58 kJ/mol for the linear CO species and from E 0 = 88 kJ/mol to E 1 = 84 kJ/mol for the bridged CO species at coverages 0 and 1, respectively. Volumetric measurements indicate that the total amount of the adsorbed CO species represents a small fraction of the superficial sites of the reduced Ag particles suggesting that they are adsorbed on defect sites.

We also report a new method for the preparation and hybridization of rGO sheets through chemical reduction {{in the presence of}} EDOT during the generation of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). These hybridized films had conductivities that were more than 50 % higher than that of PEDOT:PTS alone, produced by the interconnection of rGO sheets. The optimized rGO-PEDOT:PTS films had an excellent electrical conductivity of 1, 500  S cm- 1, a sheet resistance of 70 Ω sq- 1, and 80 % optical transmittance, despite the conductivity of PEDOT:PTS itself being 1, 050  S cm- 1. Compared to the traditional compositing technique and PEDOT:PTS film-forming procedures, this process enhanced the carrier density via effective percolation in the electrical conductivity. These results confirm that highly conductive rGO-PEDOT:PTS hybrid films can potentially be used as transparent electrodes in flexible electronics.|$|E

Two solid fuels have been used, a Mexican petroleum coke and a Colombian coal. The oxygen carrier material used in this study was CaMn 0. 875 Ti 0. 125 O 3 -δ and was developed and manufactured by the Norwegian research institute SINTEF. The experiments were conducted in a discontinuous quartz glass batch fluidized-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 10 mm. The particle bed rests on a porous plate and thermocouples 5 mm under and 10 above the plate was used for measuring the temperature. In the oxidation phase a flow of 1000 ml/min with 5 % oxygen in nitrogen was used. During the solid fuel experiments the bed was fluidized with 600 ml/min nitrogen while 0. 1 g of solid fuel added to the reactor from the top. Two solid fuels were used; petroleum coke and Colombian coal. In the experiments with gaseous fuels the bed was fluidized with 900 ml/min consisting of 450 ml/min CH 4 and 450 ml/min with 0. 25 - 0. 5 % SO 2 in nitrogen. It was found that the Colombian coal was oxidized considerably faster than the petroleum coke, which is unexpected since it could be expected that the kinetics for O 2 release from the oxygen carrier should determine conversion rate rather than the reactivity of the fuels. The overall rate of conversion increased for experiments with larger bed mass though, which was expected.

5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily <b>oxidizes</b> to the <b>solid</b> +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|R

40|$|The time {{resolved}} {{mechanism of}} electrodeposition {{and the effect}} of this changing mechanism on the nucleation and growth of solid manganese dioxide has been investigated in both acidic and neutral electrolytes on the rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE). The fate of the Mn 3 + intermediate is a key feature of this electrodeposition mechanism, the formation of which is dependent on the substrate, which in this case is either platinum, MnO₂ or MnOOH. On the platinum surface, for all electrolytes, soluble Mn 3 + is produced initially. The stability of this soluble Mn 3 + species determines the initial morphology, and rate of change of mechanism for the process. In a neutral electrolyte, nucleation and growth of MnO₂ occurs primarily through the precipitation of a 2 D film of MnOOH on the platinum, which rapidly covers the surface. Nucleation in an acidic H₂SO₄ system occurs primarily via a disproportionation route which forms 3 D MnO₂ hemispheroids that cover the substrate slowly. Subsequent growth of MnO₂ in both electrolytes then proceeds via formation of a MnOOH film, which is subsequently <b>oxidized</b> in the <b>solid</b> state to form MnO₂.

Extensive charge reorganization at the metal-oxide contact is predicted for ceria-supported Cu adatoms and nanoparticles, leading to Cu oxidation, ceria reduction, and interfacial Ce(3 +) ions. The calculated thermodynamics predict that Cu adatoms on stoichiometric surfaces are more stable than on O vacancies of reduced surfaces at all temperatures and pressures relevant for catalytic applications, even in extremely reducing chemical environments. This suggests that supported Cu nanoparticles do not nucleate at surface O vacancies of the oxide, at variance with many other metal/ceria systems.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanism of}} bias-induced resistance switching observed in polypyrrole (PPy) based solid state junctions, in situ UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was employed to monitor oxidation states within PPy layers in solution and in PPy/metal oxide junctions. For PPy layers in acetonitrile, oxidation led primarily to cationic polaron formation, while oxidation in 0. 1 M NaOH in H 2 O resulted in imine formation, caused by deprotonation of polarons. On {{the basis of these}} results in solution, spectroelectrochemistry was used to monitor bias-induced formation of polarons and imines in PPy layers incorporated into solid state carbon/PPy/Al 2 O 3 /Pt junctions. A positive bias on the carbon electrode caused PPy oxidation, with the formation of polaron and imine species strongly dependent on the surrounding environment. The spectral changes associated with polarons or imines were stable for at least several hours after the applied bias, while a negative bias reversed the absorbance changes back to the initial PPy spectrum. These results indicate that PPy can be <b>oxidized</b> in nominally <b>solid</b> state devices, and the formation of stable polarons is dependent on the tendency for deprotonation of the polaron to the imine. Since PPy conductivity depends strongly on the polaron concentration, monitoring its concentration is critical to determining resistance switching mechanisms.

It {{was determined that}} the removal of Nap particles occurred through an indirect route. Specifically, Nap released through dissolution from the pure Nap particles was subsequently oxidized in the aqueous phase by SO(4) (-center dot). Rapid destruction of dissolved Nap created a greater concentration gradient between the solid and aqueous phases. This caused more Nap particles to be dissolved which were then available for the subsequent oxidative destruction of dissolved Nap. The rate constant (k(obs,Nap)) of ZVI activated persulfate degradation of dissolved Nap {{was determined to be}} 3. 74 min(- 1). The overall dissolution mass transfer coefficients (k(L) a) for the Nap particles were determined, 3. 0 x 10 (- 2) min(- 1) with initial 10 mg Nap in 40 mL water, and found to be proportional to the quantities of the Nap particles present. The results indicate that the k(obs,Nap) is much greater than the k(L) a. The net result of the dissolution of Nap particles and the destruction of dissolved Nap by oxidation was the removal of Nap particles. Sequential additions of ZVI at a lower concentration to slow down the formation of SO(4) (-center dot) can preventthe scavenging of SO(4) (-center dot) by ZVI and enhance the removal of Nap particles.

40|$|As {{this paper}} goes to press a {{complete}} {{review of the}} chemistry of the fertile egg will be appearing (19). The author, Mr. J. Needham, {{was kind enough to}} allow me to inspect his manuscript and thus avail myself of the comprehensive bibliography and discussion. It is surprising that no biochemists have estimated the changing water content of the egg during incubation. Many of the analyses reported in Needham's review were expressed in per cent of total weight or per cent of dry solid, and consequently are of questionable value, since these latter functions are themselves changing; the former due to water evaporation and the latter through the addition of shell constituents and the burning of oxidizable organic compounds. Moreover, there has been no statistical treatment of the results, and the reliability of the average, figures obtained has consequently been difficult to estimate. Tangl's work, quoted throughout this paper, except for its lack of statistical treatment is more enlightening. However, his concept of the so called "Energy of Embryogenesis" which he propounds, seems to me misleading and unwarranted. What Tangl measured was the amount and the caloric value of the solid material burned and thus the quantity of energy lost during the embryonic period. The latter is equivalent to the usual measurements of catabolism. In the case of the embryo it is not basal metabolism which is being estimated, since the conditions are not basal. The embryo is absorbing and assimilating nutriment all the while at a relatively rapid rate. The calorific value of the <b>oxidized</b> <b>solid,</b> which is in truth the amount of energy lost during a certain chosen interval, in Tangl's judgment stands for the energy of embryogenesis; i. e., the energy of development (growth + differentiation). We believe that this conception is erroneous. The two processes, anabolism and catabolism, occur together and undoubtedly have some relationship, but surely one is not a measure of the other. In a starving animal, and so probably in a starving embryo, there is a considerable amount of so called basal metabolism. Thus if the "Embryogenetic Energy" were measured under these conditions a figure would be obtained for which there was no growth to correspond, or in other words there would be a value for something which did not exist. It will be seen in our later communications that the changes with age of metabolic rate and growth rate do not coincide. The amount of catabolism under certain circumstances does not accelerate growth or anabolism, but seems rather to be a limiting factor. It is as if when the absorbed energy were constant an increase of catabolism would make inroads upon the amount of energy which otherwise would remain for storage (growth). If, as Pembrey's (20) experiments would tend to show, there is an increase of metabolism in the oldest embryos when the outside temperature is lowered, one would find at the end of incubation in such cases that there was a greater amount of so called "Energy of Development" but smaller embryo. It seems that the potential energy amassed as growth comes from that remaining after the needs of the body have been satisfied. The results of the experiments described in this paper have formed the basis for judgment in the selection of suitable standard conditions for the incubation of hen's eggs. Standardization was necessary so that in future experiments the more important environmental factors might be kept uniform within a certain appropriate range and therefore not be held accountable for deviations observed in the embryos. Henceforth in this series of papers the term "standard incubation conditions" will signify that (1) the temperature was constantly at 38. 8 ± 0. 4 °C., (2) the humidity at 67. 5 ± 2. 5 per cent, (3) there was a continuous flow of warm air into the incubator to provide the necessary circulation, and (4) the eggs were rolled once a day within the constant temperature room. The incubator, a double-walled copper cabinet, stands in a constant temperature room, the fluctuations of which are ± 1. 0 °C. The space between the walls of the incubator is filled with water which serves as a buffer to outer variations. It might be repeated that all the eggs are from White Leghorn hens, are incubated 2 days after laying, and that they are kept cold during the interval necessary for transportation. With the figures from our chemical analyses and metabolic rate experiments, it was possible to calculate values for the concentration of total solids, fat, and nitrogen throughout the incubation period. These data were necessary as a general chemical background for further work. The results of the calculations are obviously rough. Because of the great variability of the eggs a satisfactory degree of accuracy could not have been attained without {{a very large number of}} analyses supplemented by complete statistical treatment. The necessity for such a comprehensive study was not evident, and it is our belief that the approximations reached in this paper are sufficiently close to serve our present purposes. The chief facts that have been ascertained in this investigation are (1) Loss of water by the egg during incubation is a function of the atmospheric humidity in its immediate environment. More rapid circulation of air lowers the humidity around the egg and thus increases evaporation. Other facts influencing evaporation are (a) atmospheric temperature, (b) thickness and surface area of the shell, and (c) conditions within the egg, the most important of which, it is suggested, is the amount of heat produced by the embryo. The latter factor, in turn, depends upon its size and age, and a significant change does not become apparent until the last 3 or 4 days of incubation, that is to say, when the embryo is of sufficient mass to exert a measurable force. (2) The surface area of the eggs in sq. cm. may be approximately represented by the formula S = K W⅔, where K = 5. 07 ± 0. 10, and W = the weight of the whole egg in gm. (3) There is a loss of weight by the shell during incubation. This is most noticeable near the end of the cycle, when the loss seems to parallel in general the weight of the embryo. (4) There is also a loss of solid matter during incubation. Chemical analyses indicate that about 98 per cent of the material oxidized is fat. This conclusion is corroborative of previous work by Hasselbalch, Hasselbalch and Bohr, and Tangl. (5) Carbon dioxide may be measured with relative accuracy. When it is assumed that it is derived from the oxidation of fat, satisfactory corroboration of the chemical analyses is obtained. These experiments have furnished the data from which the values have been calculated for total solids, fats, and protein in the whole egg throughout incubation. The figures may be used later for comparison with the concentration of these substances within the embryo...|$|R
40|$|Potentiometric sensors {{are very}} {{attractive}} tools for chemical analysis {{because of their}} simplicity, low power consumption and low cost. They are extensively used in clinical diagnostics and in environmental monitoring. Modern applications of both fields require improvements in the conventional construction and {{in the performance of}} the potentiometric sensors, as the trends are towards portable, on-site diagnostics and autonomous sensing in remote locations. The aim of this PhD work was to improve some of the sensor properties that currently hamper the implementation of the potentiometric sensors in modern applications. The first part of the work was concentrated on the development of a solid-state reference electrode (RE) compatible with already existing solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (ISE), both of which are needed for all-solid-state potentiometric sensing systems. A poly(vinyl chloride) membrane doped with a moderately lipophilic salt, tetrabutylammonium-tetrabutylborate (TBA-TBB), was found to show a satisfactory stability of potential in sample solutions with different concentrations. Its response time was nevertheless slow, as it required several minutes to reach the equilibrium. The TBA-TBB membrane RE worked well together with solid-state ISEs in several different situations and on different substrates enabling a miniature design. Solid contacts (SC) that mediate the ion-to-electron transduction are crucial components of well-functioning potentiometric sensors. This transduction process converting the ionic conduction of an ion-selective membrane to the electronic conduction in the circuit was studied with the help of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The solid contacts studied were (i) the conducting polymer (CP) poly(3, 4 -ethylienedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and (ii) a carbon cloth having a high surface area. The PEDOT films were doped with a large immobile anion poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS-) or with a small mobile anion Cl-. As could be expected, the studied PEDOT solid-contact mediated the ion-toelectron transduction more efficiently than the bare glassy carbon substrate, onto which they were electropolymerized, while the impedance of the PEDOT films depended on the mobility of the doping ion and on the ions in the electrolyte. The carbon cloth was found to be an even more effective ion-to-electron transducer than the PEDOT films and it also proved to work as a combined electrical conductor and solid contact when covered with an ion-selective membrane or with a TBA-TBB-based reference membrane. The last part of the work was focused on improving the reproducibility and the potential stability of the SC-ISEs, a problem that culminates to the stability of the standard potential E°. It was proven that the E° of a SC-ISE with a conducting polymer as a solid contact could be adjusted by reducing or <b>oxidizing</b> the CP <b>solid</b> contact by applying current pulses or a potential to it, as the redox state of the CP solid-contact influences the overall potential of the ISE. The slope and thus the analytical performance of the SC-ISEs were retained despite the adjustment of the E°. The shortcircuiting of the SC-ISE with a conventional large-capacitance RE was found to be a feasible instrument-free method to control the E°. With this method, the driving force for the oxidation/reduction of the CP was the potential difference between the RE and the SC-ISE, and the position of the adjusted potential could be controlled by choosing a suitable concentration for the short-circuiting electrolyte. The piece-to-piece reproducibility of the adjusted potential was promising, and the day-today reproducibility for a specific sensor was excellent. The instrumentfree approach to control the E° is very attractive considering practical applications...|$|R
