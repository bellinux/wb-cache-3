Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, <b>one</b> <b>crucial</b> factor being the eradication of the important Sittaung valley breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites. The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|The French tanks had heavier armour and {{armament}} {{than the}} Panzers. The Panzer IV had 30mm of armour, while the Hotchkiss had 45mm, and the Char B1 had 60mm of protection. Moreover, its main armament, one 47mm and one 75mm gun, outmatched all the German tanks. In {{an open field}} engagement, Guderian's armour stood little chance. Two-thirds of his units were equipped with Panzer I and IIs. Just 30 of the Panzer IVs were on his order of battle. However, <b>one</b> <b>crucial</b> disadvantage of the French tanks, considered as a very broad whole, was their low endurance. They needed refuelling after just two hours. They were also slow in speed, complicating high tempo operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{first version}} {{predicted}} that Germans would attack from Pomerania towards Warsaw, with supporting thrusts from Silesia and Prussia, aiming at establishing an early link through the Polish Corridor between German Pomerania and Prussia. After German annexation {{of parts of}} Czechoslovakia and changes of borders, Polish planners revised the plan {{with the expectation that}} a main thrust would originate from Silesia - through Piotrków and Łódź towards Warsaw and Kraków. The Polish planners correctly predicted the direction of most German thrusts, with <b>one</b> <b>crucial</b> exception: they assigned low priority to a possible deep, flanking, eastward push from Prussia and Slovakia, a push that was however assigned high priority in the German plan (Fall Weiss).|$|E
25|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century {{was a time of}} {{domestic}} crises and external threats for Joseon Korea (1392–1910). Starting in the 1860s, a series of rebellions caused by excessive taxation and misgovernment threatened the reigning dynasty, while foreign powers — mostly western countries, but also Meiji Japan — used military force to try to open Korea to trade. The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 opened three Korean ports to commerce and granted Japanese merchants extraterritoriality in these ports. This unequal treaty prompted even more foreign interventions, as it turned Korea into a target of rivalry between imperialist powers. <b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> issue was whether Korea was a sovereign state or a Chinese dependency. Despite Joseon's status as a tributary of Ming (1368–1644) and then Qing (1644–1911) China — which implied the sending of tribute missions and a ritually inferior position of the Korean king vis-à-vis the Chinese emperor — Korea could also dictate both its domestic and foreign policies, creating an ambiguous situation that frustrated western powers.|$|E
500|$|Thus, the Persian failure {{may be seen}} {{partly as}} a result of two {{strategic}} mistakes that handed the Allies tactical advantages, and resulted in decisive defeats for the Persians. The Allied success is often seen as the result of [...] "free men fighting for their freedom". This may have played a part, and certainly the Greeks seem to have interpreted their victory in those terms. <b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> factor in the Allied success was that, having formed an alliance, however fractious, they remained true to it, despite the odds. There appear to have been many occasions when the alliance seemed in doubt, but ultimately it withstood; and while this alone did not defeat the Persians, it meant that even after the occupation of most of Greece, the Allies were not themselves defeated. This is exemplified by the remarkable fact that the citizens of Athens, Thespiae and Plataea chose to carry on fighting from exile rather than submit to the Persians. Ultimately, the Allies succeeded because they avoided catastrophic defeats, stuck to their alliance, took advantage of Persian mistakes, and because in the hoplite they possessed an advantage (perhaps their only real advantage at the start of the conflict), which, at Plataea, allowed them to destroy the Persian invasion force.|$|E

2500|$|Transformed oligonucleotides are {{incorporated}} into the cellular DNA through λ-red- and Cas9 endonuclease-mediated homologous recombination. [...] λ-red is activated when arabinose binds to expressed AraC, inducing dimerization of the AraC protein and subsequent DNA binding to activate the promoter [...] prior to oligonucleotide transfection. This step is followed by induced expression of the Cas9 nuclease and the sgRNA through binding of anhydrotetracycline to the PTET promoter. Cas9, with {{the guidance of the}} transformed sgRNA, identifies the E. coli complement target sequence and initiates a double strand break. <b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> aspect is that the target gene must be in close proximity upstream of the PAM sequence. Fortunately, the PAM NGG sequence occurs at 424,651 instances on both strands of the E. coli chromosome, so this method is not limited in its targeted specificity.|$|E

The narrator grows up {{the child of a}} white Dutch family on Java, with Oeroeg, a native young man; as high-school {{students}} they live together in a boarding house. <b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> event is the death of Oeroeg's father, who died while saving the narrator from drowning. During World War II the narrator joins the Dutch army, and when he returns to Java finds that the world has changed: Indonesian nationalists have declared independence, and no longer accept the colonial overlord. In addition, the narrator's father is murdered, and he suspects his old friend, who has joined the Indonesian nationalist movement, of avenging his own father's death. At the end of the novel, the narrator has lost his friend, his identity, and his home country.|$|E
2500|$|Heidegger claimed {{philosophy}} and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, {{which was a}} superficial way of understanding them. <b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of Franz Brentano's treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word [...] "being", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, Being and Time, with a citation from Plato's Sophist indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question. Heidegger's intuition {{about the question of}} Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the [...] "history of Being", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive destruction of the history of philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|Potential {{diplomatic}} {{resolution of}} territorial concerns between Japan and Russia failed; historians {{have argued that}} this directly resulted from the actions of Tsar Nicholas II. <b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> error of Nicholas was his mismanagement of government. Although certain scholars contend the situation arose from the determination of Tsar Nicholas II to use the war against Japan to spark a revival in Russian patriotism, no historical evidence supports this claim. The Tsar's advisors {{did not support the}} war, foreseeing problems in transporting troops and supplies from European Russia to the East. Convinced that his rule was divinely ordained and that he held responsibility to God, Nicholas II held the ideals of preserving the autocracy and defending the dignity, honor, and worth of Russia. This attitude by the Tsar led to repeated delays in negotiations with the Japanese government. The Japanese understanding of this can be seen from a telegram dated 1 December 1903 from Japanese minister of foreign affairs, Komura, to the minister to Russia, in which he stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{conditions}} worsened, rents rose to {{as high as}} 75–80% of net produce, {{leaving the}} verumpattakkar cultivators largely [...] "only straw". This caused great resentment among the Mappilas, who, {{in the words of}} Logan, were [...] "labouring late and early to provide a sufficiency of food for their wives and children". General resentment amongst the Muslim population led to a long series of violent outbreaks beginning in 1836. These always involved the murder of Hindus, an act which the disgruntled Mappilas regarded as religiously meritorious and as part of their larger obligation to establish an Islamic state. In 1921, for instance, the stated aim was not to oust the Janmi system, but to establish an Islamic nation in Malabar. The British administration referred to the outbreaks as [...] "Moplah outrages", but modern historians tend to treat them as religious outbreaks or expressions of agrarian discontent. The massacre of Hindus and widespread sexual violence in 1921–22 sustained this tradition of violence in Malabar but with <b>one</b> <b>crucial</b> difference: this time it had also a political ideology and a formal organisation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>crucial</b> {{factor in}} Toungoo’s success was the army’s early {{adoption}} of Portuguese firearms (arquebus matchlocks and cast-metal muzzleloader cannon), and formation of musket and artillery units. Portuguese weaponry proved superior in accuracy, safety, ballistic weight, and rapidity of fire than Asian-made counterparts. The first special musket and artillery units, made up mostly of Portuguese and Indian Ocean (mostly Muslim) mercenaries, were {{formed in the}} late 1530s. The Burmese later learned to integrate matchlocks into both infantry and elephanteer units. In some late 16th-century campaigns, as high as 20–33 percent of the troops were equipped with muskets. But artillery units continued to be manned by foreign mercenaries throughout the 16th century. Toungoo artillery corps never acquired massive siege guns of Europe but they [...] "used Portuguese cannon to good effect by mounting them on high mounds or towers, and then shooting down into besieged towns". Portuguese firearms proved particularly effective against interior states like the Shan states. However, the advantage of firearms was neutralised against Siam, a prosperous coastal power with its own well-equipped military.|$|E

2500|$|Landy {{distinguishes between}} the [...] "commercial wing" [...] and [...] "the {{academic}} wing" [...] of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI {{as seen by}} the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that [...] "the most effective leaders are alike in <b>one</b> <b>crucial</b> way: they all have {{a high degree of}} {{what has come to be}} known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of leadership". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions [...] "the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards." [...] Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in [...] "proprietary databases", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification. Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-1987, {{frontman}} Colin Angus was {{discovering the}} sounds of early house-music pioneers, such as S-Express and M/A/R/R/S, and increasing {{his knowledge of the}} latest studio gadgetry. By September 1987, the Shamen were applying these techniques to their own music, mixing rock guitars, techno and hip-hop rhythms and sampled radio voices which was to prove so influential to groups like Jesus Jones and EMF. Their single [...] "Christopher Mayhew Says", released in late 1987 was their first single to experiment with beat machines and samples, fusing them with their psychedelic rock sound. However, the newfound sound proved too radical for co-founder and vocalist Derek McKenzie, who left the band in late 1987 to study at university. The Shamen were suddenly <b>one</b> <b>crucial</b> player short. Help was at hand in the charismatic form of Glaswegian Will Sinnott (23 December 1960 – 23 May 1991), aka Will Sin, who joined the group in October 1987, on bass and keyboards, freeing up Angus to handle vocals and guitar. Sinnott's musical background was an extensive one. He had already made an impression as part of the Can/SAHB influenced improvisation troupe Edith and the Ladies, and his father, a master wood craftsman, had made guitars for the Incredible String Band and John Martyn. At the start of 1988, the first music videos were shot for the Shamen, those being [...] "Christopher Mayhew Says" [...] and [...] "Knature of a Girl".|$|E
