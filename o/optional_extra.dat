5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales.

From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E
500|$|Other sites {{providing}} Wood Badge training {{have taken}} the Gilwell name. The first Australian Wood Badge courses were held in 1920 after the return of two newly minted Deputy Camp Chiefs, Charles Hoadley and Mr. Russell {{at the home of}} Victorian Scouting, Gilwell Park, Gembrook.

500|$|Each Adcock range station {{had four}} [...] antenna towers erected on {{the corners of}} a 425× 425ft square, with an <b>optional</b> <b>extra</b> tower in the center for voice {{transmission}} and homing. The stations emitted directional electromagnetic radiation at 190 to 535 kHz and 1,500watts, into four quadrants. The radiation of one opposing quadrant pair was modulated (at an audio frequency of 1,020Hz) with a Morse code for the letter A (·—), and the other pair with the letter N (—·). The intersections between the quadrants defined four course lines emanating from the transmitting station, along four compass directions, where the A and N signals were of equal intensity, with their combined Morse codes merging into a steady 1,020Hz audio tone. These course lines (also called [...] "legs"), where only a tone could be heard, defined the airways.|$|E
500|$|Like many 1980s-era platformers, {{the player}} can {{accumulate}} points by defeating enemies and collecting items, {{with an extra}} life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby's Dream Land lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses {{to return to the}} title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. Once the game has been completed, a code is offered to play an <b>optional</b> <b>Extra</b> Game, in which the difficulty is significantly increased. [...] Completing the extra game offered a second code that lets the player adjust lives and vitality settings to play an even easier or harder game, and listen to music and sound effects freely. Since there is no save function, these codes are allowed to be entered even on a new session where the game has not been beaten yet.|$|E

2500|$|It is very {{important}} for the Church to continue saying that having children and their nurture is a basic good of marriage and not an <b>optional</b> <b>extra.</b> Just as a marriage is not complete without mutual support, companionship and love, so there is a real lack if the intention is never to have children, regardless of circumstances. This signals that marriage {{is not a matter of}} self-indulgence. In our age, such teaching is crucial." ...|$|E
2500|$|Features include {{independent}} {{double wishbone}} suspension, electrically assisted steering and integrated roll hoops. The car features [...] wheels with Bridgestone Potenza S-02 tires.

2500|$|Within the {{educational}} system, {{the concept of}} global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as multicultural education, peace education, human rights education, Education for Sustainable Development and international education. [...] Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity. Teachers are being given the responsibility of being social change agents.

2500|$|Another South African, Gary Player was Champion in 1959. This {{was at the}} {{beginning}} of the [...] "Big Three" [...] era in professional golf, the three players in question being Player, Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus. Palmer first competed in 1960, when he came second to the little-known Australian Kel Nagle, but he won the next two years. While he was far from being the first American to become Open Champion, he was the first that many Americans saw win the tournament on television, and his charismatic success is often credited with persuading leading American golfers to make The Open an integral part of their schedule, rather than an <b>optional</b> <b>extra.</b> The improvement of trans-Atlantic travel also increased American participation.|$|E

Daimler versions were launched in October 1969, {{in a series of}} television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these spots, he referred to the car as [...] "the finest Jaguar ever". An unusual feature, inherited from the Mark X and S-Type saloons, was the provision of twin fuel tanks, positioned {{on each side of the}} boot / trunk, and filled using two separately lockable filler caps: one on the top of each wing above the rear wheel arches. Preliminary reviews of the car were favourable, noting the effective brakes and good ride quality.|$|E

50|$|SX {{models for}} example, {{featured}} power windows, power locks, adjustable belts and steering wheel, front fog lights, body coloured bumpers, velvet upholstery, a futuristic digital dashboard {{and many other}} standard extras.
