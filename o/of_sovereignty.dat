5|$|On 1 July 1997, the {{transfer}} <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China took place, officially marking {{the end of}} Hong Kong's 156 years under British colonial governance. As the largest remaining colony of the United Kingdom, the loss of Hong Kong effectively represented {{the end of the}} British Empire. This transfer <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> made Hong Kong the first special administrative region of China. Tung Chee-Hwa, a pro-Beijing business tycoon, was elected Hong Kong's first Chief Executive by a selected electorate of 800 in a televised programme.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 1991, the Croatian {{government}} held {{a nationwide}} referendum on a declaration <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs {{to boycott the}} referendum, while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote, but the referendum passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together with the issue <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under {{the sovereignty of the}} Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the planned}} {{transfer}} <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Hong Kong, plans were drawn {{up in the}} 1990s for a new flag to replace the blue ensign.

5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} intense {{pressure}} from the Germans to conclude peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized army {{and the fate of}} the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> on 31 December 1917.|$|E

5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested {{with many of the}} traditional symbols <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> except a crown. A crown, perhaps saved from the melting pot in 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E

5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The 1936 treaty was {{designed}} to counter Benito Mussolini's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via Sudan in a new Italian empire. The treaty recognized Egyptian claims <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E
5|$|The National Diet is the legislature, {{the organ}} of the Legislative branch.

5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{negotiations}} between Sultan Ali and the Temenggong ensued with the British colonial government {{acting as the}} intermediary, after Sultan Ali had questioned the Temenggong's rights of keeping the state revenue to himself. Initially, the Temenggong proposed to split the trade revenue of Johor on condition that Sultan Ali surrendered his claims <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> over Johor. The term was declined by Sultan Ali. Both parties agreed to seek the direct intervention of the British government, among which, the British Governor of the Straits Settlement, Colonel William Butterworth, and his successor, Edmund Blundell were roped in to act as meditators.|$|E
