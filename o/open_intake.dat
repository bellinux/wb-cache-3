50|$|During low-rpm operation, {{only one}} intake valve opens, {{allowing}} air and fuel into the combustion chamber. The other intake valve {{has only a}} slight amount of lift and its timing is staggered. As a result, the air-fuel charge drawn through the <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> valve undergoes a swirl effect. The swirl creates a stratified charge with a rich mixture near the spark plug for good light-off, and a progressively leaner mixture toward its periphery. This stratified charge, combined with improved EGR control, results in lower emissions especially during the critical warm-up period, and better fuel economy. Low-friction, roller-bearing rocker arms are used to help reduce friction and improve engine efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} VTEC-E implementation is {{a variation}} of SOHC VTEC {{which is used to}} increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of roller rocker arms and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation(one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation(the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder—a very mild cam lobe with little lift and a normal cam lobe with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild cam lobe, forcing most of the intake charge through the other <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> valve with the normal cam lobe. This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine's speed and load increase, both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a sliding pin, just like with the original VTEC. This sliding pin connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the [...] "normal" [...] camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the [...] "normal" [...] cam lobe has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} of surface waters constitutes a health risk for drinking water consumers {{which may be}} lowered by closing the raw water intake. We have evaluated microbial discharge events reported in the river Göta älv, which is used for raw water supply {{to the city of}} Göteborg.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{occurrence}} of HABs in seawater, their effects on the operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants, the indicators for quantifying/predicting these effects, and the pretreatment strategies for mitigating operational issues during algal blooms. The potential issues in SWRO plants during HABs are particulate/organic fouling of pretreatment systems and biological fouling of RO membranes, mainly due to accumulation of algal organic matter (AOM). The presence of HAB toxins in desalinated water is also a potential concern but only at very low concentrations. Monitoring algal cell density, AOM concentrations and membrane fouling indices is a promising approach to assess the quality of SWRO feedwater and performance of the pretreatment system. When geological condition is favourable, subsurface intake can be a robust pretreatment for SWRO during HABs. Existing SWRO plants with <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> and are fitted with granular media filtration can improve performance in terms of capacity and product water quality, if preceded by dissolved air flotation or sedimentation.

30|$|The {{feed water}} was {{obtained}} from an <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> located on the Arabian Gulf Sea and fed to the SWRO membrane after passing through a sand filter without adding any chemicals except sulfuric acid (to control scaling by maintaining pH at about 7 during early stages). No coagulant or disinfectant was added. A single cartridge filter with nominal pore size of 5  μ was used (Fig.  1). This arrangement was adopted to accelerate membrane fouling and the SWRO membrane unit was initially operated at a feed flow rate of 1  m 3 /h and at a recovery of 25  % corresponding to a membrane water flux of 19.2  l/m 2 /h (LMH). However, after (initially) operating for about a month, the operation conditions were changed due to the very slow fouling rate on the membranes. Hence, for the remaining period, the sand filter was bypassed and recovery was raised to 30  %, resulting in an increased membrane flux with an extremely high value of 23 LMH (Fig.  2). In addition, the feed pH was gradually raised by reducing acid dosing and subsequently by completely stopping the acid injection so that ambient seawater (pH ≈  8) was used. Plant operation data, such as flow, temperature, pH, conductivity and the pressure of SWRO feed, product and reject were collected on a daily basis. Performance decline due to fouling was estimated based on the reduction in normalized flow and salt rejection. Normalization was carried out according to standard ASTM procedure (4516 - 85 1989).|$|E
40|$|With the new {{approach}} to seawater desalination processes, which was developed at Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC), R&D Center, the nanofiltration (NF) membrane pretreatment process is used to supply feed/make-up to operate conventional seawater desalination plants. The seawater treatment first with the NF membrane removed from it turbidity and microorganism, caused significant rejection of the scale forming hardness ions, reduced TDS in Gulf Seawater and produced a new, partially desalinated seawater product, considerably different and superior to seawater in qualities and without the problems normally associated with seawater. The said desalination arrangements lead to a significant improvement in the seawater desalination processes. The NF pilot plant used in above investigation has been in continuous operation for over 10, 000 hours. The pretreatment of the nonchlorinated seawater feed (taken from an <b>open</b> <b>intake)</b> to the NF pilot plant was limited to simple, nonchemical dual media filtration without coagulation.

30|$|The {{effect on}} the {{spark-ignition}} combustion process of n-butanol blended in volume with pure gasoline was investigated through cycle-resolved visualization applied in a single-cylinder PFI SI engine working at low speed, medium boosting and wide-open throttle. Two injection timings were fixed in order to inject the fuel at closed intake valve and <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> valve, respectively. The spark timing was changed to identify the maximum brake torque and the knocking limit. Blends of butanol up to 40 % allowed working in more advanced spark timing without negative effects on performance. To work with a stoichiometric mixture for both fuels, the duration of injection was slightly increased for the blend. DOI in CV resulted longer than in OV for both fuels because, in CV injection, part of the injected spray is deposited on the intake manifold surfaces, forming a layer of liquid film. If these fuel layers are not well atomized, they enter the cylinder as drops and ligaments. During the normal combustion process, {{only part of the}} fuel deposits was completely burned. Thus, more fuel should be injected to reach the selected air-fuel ratio measured at the exhaust. When the normal flame front reached the fuel deposits, abnormal combustion was incepted. This was characterized by intense diffusion-controlled flames. Their contribution to the combustion pressure was negligible. The different levels of intensity were related to different carbonaceous structures and soot precursor concentrations. CV condition was characterized by higher fuel deposition amount and thus more intense diffusion-controlled flames than OV. Gasoline in CV condition showed the highest luminosity, and BU 40 in OV condition, the lowest one. This demonstrated that BU 40 _OV allowed the reduction of emission of ultrafine carbonaceous particles at the exhaust and the optimization of fuel consumption at fixed performance. Moreover, medium-low percentage of butanol in the gasoline allowed the reduction of NOx and unburned hydrocarbon emission. Finally, even if an increase in the injected fuel amount should be considered to obtain the same air-fuel ratio for butanol-gasoline blend, if compared to pure gasoline, the better efficiency of fuel deposit burning allowed the reduction of that amount.|$|E
30|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of osmotic backwash induced by high salt (NaCl) concentration solution on feed side of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membranes, online and offline, in controlling membrane fouling and therefore minimizing/eliminating the need for chemical cleaning. SWRO membranes were deliberately fouled by feeding seawater from an <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> located on the Arabian Gulf Coast without dosing chemicals. The fouled membranes were subjected to offline cleaning with the salt solution of up to 25  % concentration. Despite the partial removal of foulants from the membrane surface, SWRO membrane performance could not be restored, indicating the ineffectiveness of osmotic backwash in aiding offline salt cleaning. Similarly, online osmotic backwash was found to be not only ineffective in removing foulants from membrane surfaces but actually increased the fouling rate, as indicated by faster fouling rates compared to other cases. Although the driving force required for the osmotic backwash existed, the generated back flow proved to be insufficient to detach foulants from membrane surfaces. During the study period, the average SWRO membrane flux was maintained between 19 and 23 LMH, whereas the average generated back flow flux by high salt concentration solution was only 11 LMH, which was not adequate to remove foulants from membrane surfaces. Moreover, it seems that the membrane configuration as well as inherent microstructure of SWRO membrane places certain constraints on the osmotic backwash process and renders osmotic backwash ineffective in tackling SWRO membrane fouling. Hence, chemical cleaning is essential to restore SWRO membrane performance whenever fouling occurs, and the use of highly concentrated salt solution does not have any significant benefit. Membrane autopsy revealed only an insignificant accumulation of biofouling layer despite the absence of disinfection. However, it was shown that culturable biofilm bacteria species isolated from membranes tolerated exposure to high salt concentrations at pH range of 7 – 8. In addition, the overall findings of the study indicate that SWRO membranes can be operated in Gulf seawater at a recovery of 30  % without using any chemicals, such as coagulant, disinfectant and antiscalant, for an acceptable period of time without performing membrane cleaning. This is highly likely, if media filters are used in the pretreatment and SWRO membranes are operated at normal flux and recovery ratio.|$|E

40|$|Shuqaiq-II IWP is a {{combined}} RO water desalination and power plant facility. It operates with an <b>open</b> <b>intake</b> that feeds the plant with 100, 000 m 3 /h of raw water. The facility is located 140 km north of Jizan, {{in a small}} bay where the run-off discharges of two wadis converge. The run-off coming from the wadis are rich in alluvial sediments that dramatically decrease the raw water quality at the intake point, causing periodic shutdowns of the plant and increasing the operational cost due to membrane replacement. Subsurface water intakes are an alternative for improving raw water quality, as they provide natural filtering of the feed water as it flows through the systems. In this type of system water flow through the sediment matrix is induced and during the percolation, several physical, chemical and biological processes take place, cleaning the water from particulate matter, resulting in high quality feed water that can be directly sent to the RO process without any additional pretreatment. A full hydrogeological profile of the seabed needs to be performed {{in order to determine}} the applicability of one of these systems in each particular location.
