5|$|In the infinite-dimensional case, an {{orthonormal}} basis {{will not}} be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis. That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series, and the <b>orthogonality</b> implies that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
25|$|One econometric {{formalism}} that is {{alternative to}} the maximum likelihood framework, the Generalized Method of Moments, relies on <b>orthogonality</b> conditions.

25|$|<b>Orthogonality</b> is {{a system}} design {{property}} which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system. Typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation, and {{it is essential for}} feasible and compact designs of complex systems. The emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration, i.e., non-orthogonal design of modules and interfaces. <b>Orthogonality</b> reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>orthogonality</b> {{properties}} of the eigenvectors allows decoupling of the differential equations so that the system can be represented as linear summation of the eigenvectors. The eigenvalue problem of complex structures is often solved using finite element analysis, but neatly generalize the solution to scalar-valued vibration problems.|$|E
25|$|In 2-D or higher-dimensional Euclidean space, two vectors are {{orthogonal}} if {{and only}} if their dot product is zero, i.e. they make an angle of 90°, or π/2 radians. Hence <b>orthogonality</b> of vectors is an extension of the concept of perpendicular vectors into higher-dimensional spaces.|$|E
25|$|A {{vector space}} with a {{bilinear}} form generalizes {{the case of an}} inner product. When the bilinear form applied to two vectors results in zero, then they are orthogonal. The case of a pseudo-Euclidean plane uses the term hyperbolic <b>orthogonality.</b> In the diagram, axes x′ and t′ are hyperbolic-orthogonal for any given ϕ.|$|E
25|$|The <b>orthogonality</b> {{allows for}} {{efficient}} modulator and demodulator implementation using the FFT algorithm on the receiver side, and inverse FFT on the sender side. Although {{the principles and}} some of the benefits have been known since the 1960s, OFDM is popular for wideband communications today by way of low-cost digital signal processing components that can efficiently calculate the FFT.|$|E
25|$|The <b>orthogonality</b> {{also allows}} high {{spectral}} efficiency, {{with a total}} symbol rate near the Nyquist rate for the equivalent baseband signal (i.e. near half the Nyquist rate for the double-side band physical passband signal). Almost the whole available frequency band can be utilized. OFDM generally has a nearly 'white' spectrum, giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co-channel users.|$|E
25|$|In {{general the}} second {{observer}} traces out a worldline in the spacetime {{of the first}} observer described by t = x/v, and the set of simultaneous events for the second observer (at the origin) is described by the line t = vx. Note the multiplicative inverse relation of {{the slopes of the}} worldline and simultaneous events, in accord with the principle of hyperbolic <b>orthogonality.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Orthogonality,</b> or non-redundancy, {{does not}} {{necessarily}} indicate null correlation. Consider a secretary's performance, which might be measured by number of breaks per hour and {{the time required to}} complete reports. The two measures are orthogonal because they do not overlap. However, it is possible that repeated evaluations could show a reliable association between a higher number of breaks per hour and less time required to complete reports.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, <b>orthogonality</b> is the {{generalization}} {{of the notion}} of perpendicularity to the linear algebra of bilinear forms. Two elements u and v of a vector space with bilinear form B are orthogonal when B(u,v) = 0. When the bilinear form corresponds to a pseudo-Euclidean space, there are non-perpendicular vectors that are hyperbolic-orthogonal. In the case of function spaces, families of orthogonal functions are used to form a basis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Orthogonality</b> {{has been}} shown in the history of many industries, {{particularly}} to reflect changing expectations. American hospitals used to measure success by patient outcome. In the early 1900s, however, a study showed such dismal results with patient outcomes that the study and its results were burned, and hospitals instead evaluated performance by the keeping of records and adherence to procedures. With time, societal expectations of low patient mortality have led to hospitals reinstating the patient outcomes as a measure of success.|$|E
25|$|Using a lattice basis, neither <b>orthogonality</b> nor unit {{length is}} guaranteed, only independence. However, the trace {{is the same}} with respect to any basis. (Trace is a {{similarity}} invariant.) In a lattice basis, because the rotation must map lattice points to lattice points, each matrix entry — and hence the trace — must be an integer. Thus, for example, wallpaper and crystals cannot have 8-fold rotational symmetry. The only possibilities are multiples of 60°, 90°, 120°, and 180°, corresponding to 6-, 4-, 3-, and 2-fold rotations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{computer}} industry, programming was done in assembly language or machine code, which encouraged powerful and easy-to-use instructions. CPU designers therefore tried to make instructions that would do as much work as feasible. With the advent of higher level languages, computer architects also started to create dedicated instructions to directly implement certain central mechanisms of such languages. Another general goal was to provide every possible addressing mode for every instruction, known as <b>orthogonality,</b> to ease compiler implementation. Arithmetic operations could therefore often have results as well as operands directly in memory (in addition to register or immediate).|$|E
25|$|In linear algebra, {{an inner}} product space is a vector space with an {{additional}} structure called an inner product. This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a scalar quantity known as the inner product of the vectors. Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as {{the length of a}} vector or the angle between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining <b>orthogonality</b> between vectors (zero inner product). Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the inner product is the dot product, also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis.|$|E
25|$|A simple example: If one sends {{a million}} symbols per second using {{conventional}} single-carrier modulation over a wireless channel, then {{the duration of}} each symbol would be one microsecond or less. This imposes severe constraints on synchronization and necessitates the removal of multipath interference. If the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand sub-channels, the duration of each symbol can be longer {{by a factor of}} a thousand (i.e., one millisecond) for <b>orthogonality</b> with approximately the same bandwidth. Assume that a guard interval of 1/8 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol. Intersymbol interference can be avoided if the multipath time-spreading (the time between the reception of the first and the last echo) is shorter than the guard interval (i.e., 125 microseconds). This corresponds to a maximum difference of 37.5 kilometers between the lengths of the paths.|$|E
25|$|In {{synthetic}} {{organic chemistry}} orthogonal protection {{is a strategy}} allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other. In chemistry and biochemistry, an orthogonal interaction occurs when there are two pairs of substances and each substance can interact with their respective partner, but does not interact with either substance of the other pair. For example, DNA has two orthogonal pairs: cytosine and guanine form a base-pair, and adenine and thymine form another base-pair, but other base-pair combinations are strongly disfavored. As a chemical example, tetrazine reacts with transcyclooctene and azide reacts with cyclooctyne without any cross-reaction, so these are mutually orthogonal reactions, and so, can be performed simultaneously and selectively. Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to chemical reactions occurring inside living systems without reacting with naturally present cellular components. In supramolecular chemistry the notion of <b>orthogonality</b> refers {{to the possibility of}} two or more supramolecular, often non-covalent, interactions being compatible; reversibly forming without interference from the other.|$|E
