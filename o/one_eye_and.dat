He was still Stoke and England's number one {{when a car}} crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight in <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> his {{professional}} career. He did though play in the United States for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 1977 and 1978. He briefly entered management with Telford United, but left the game after he was sacked in December 1980.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi, and uses a shorten version of Peters' remix. The visual portrays Hamasaki in a dark laboratory, being surrounded by keyboards, electronic devices and a black bird. Throughout the music video, several people start to wear headphones and follow Hamasaki, with them eventually starting {{to listen to the}} song and observing TV monitors of the singer. Each person, including Hamasaki, wears black eye shadow on <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> a code on their hand. Over the clip, the singer is seen singing to the recording in the laboratory, with interspersed scenes portraying her wearing the outfit used for the single's artwork. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki, includingA Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), and the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014).|$|E

5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E

5|$|All is well in {{the castle}} until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her {{handkerchief}} next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured by Bulgar (Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is flogged, nearly executed, and forced {{to participate in a}} major battle between the Bulgars and the Avars (an allegory representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, an Anabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar with syphilis. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, and that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> one ear in the process, and the three set sail to Lisbon.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of cavernous sinus thrombosis is made clinically, with imaging studies {{to confirm the}} clinical impression. Proptosis, ptosis, chemosis, and cranial nerve palsy beginning in <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> progressing to the other eye establish the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Cluster {{headaches}} {{are relatively}} rare (1–3 in 10,000 people) {{and are more}} common in men than women. They present with sudden onset explosive pain around <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, runny nose and red eye).|$|E
25|$|When {{one image}} is {{presented}} to <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> a very different image {{is presented to}} the other (also known as dichoptic presentation), instead of the two images being seen superimposed, one image is seen for a few moments, then the other, then the first, and so on, randomly {{for as long as}} one cares to look. For example, if a set of vertical lines is presented to <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> a set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other, sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines, and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines.|$|E

25|$|When {{the images}} {{presented}} to the eyes differ only in their contours, rivalry {{is referred to as}} binocular contour rivalry. When the images {{presented to the}} eyes differ only in their colours, rivalry is referred to as binocular colour rivalry. When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their lightnesses, a form of rivalry called binocular lustre may be seen. When an image is presented to <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> a blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as contour dominance. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would be invisible were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> a blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as flash suppression.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, Machali lost {{almost all}} of her teeth, sight in <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> much of her {{strength}} due to aging. She also lost her territory, as her daughter Sundari from her last litter drove her out of her turf. As she was unable to hunt and kill for herself, park staff provided her with food. This intervention became somewhat controversial; tiger expert K Ullas Karanth commented that it resulted in Machali living longer than she should have, and that truly wild animals should be born, live and die naturally.|$|E

Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violante survived, although he lost vision in <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> retained very limited vision in the other eye.|$|E
