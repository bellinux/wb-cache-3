40|$|The electrodeless plasma {{discharge}} is typically driven by radio frequency (RF) power supply {{within the range}} (0. 2 ¡ 40 MHz).

RF ICP technique has achieved significance importance in a diversity of research and industrial applications for <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>threes</b> decades. It is still required to undertake both theoretical and experimental research. In this work, RF ICP technique is applied on the torch modeling in 2 D. Based on extended electromagnetic vector potential representation, an axisymmetric model in 2 D is proposed for the calculations of the electromagnetic fields in an RF ICP torch. The influence of axial vector potential is included to the vector potential formulations. This is achieved by imposing a helical current carrying wire configuration. The corresponding governing equations are solved numerically by applying finite element method (FEM) using commercial partial differential equation solver (Flex PDE 3). Based on this model, the plasma behavior and properties are examined in terms of plasma parameters. Besides, a comparativ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} convergence of per capita incomes across Swiss cantons. Contrary to the "classical approach", convergence is explored here by means of homogenous discrete state Markov processes and by nonparametrically estimating conditional income distributions. We find that <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> almost <b>three</b> decades two trends were at work. The period between 1965 and 1980 was characterized by a significant narrowing of the spread of the relative income distribution. After 1980, however, the spread increased again, almost completely offsetting the previous reduction. The shape of the distribution of relative incomes reveals a high concentration of density around the median income, a pattern that is unlikely to change in the future. ...|$|R
