2500|$|London City Airport has {{a single}} [...] long runway, and a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P728) that allows flights for the public {{transport}} of passengers or for flight training (but only for training necessary for the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> at the airport). Only multi-engine, fixed-wing aircraft with special aircraft and aircrew certification to fly 5.5° approaches are allowed to conduct operations at London City Airport.

2500|$|The Investigation {{therefore}} expressed its {{concern that}} [...] "the regulatory {{authority of the}} State of the Operator did not identify the Operator’s shortcomings, thereby contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident." [...] It noted that, since the UK and Irish regulators were expressly prohibited by Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 from exercising any regulatory function in respect of the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> from other Member States within and between their territories, both were obliged to rely on the oversight of Spain [...] "to ensure compliance in regulatory matters". It was concluded that in practice [...] "the evidence shows that such oversight was of limited scope and low effectiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vampires and Sea Vampires {{were used}} in trials from 1947 to 1955 to develop {{recovery}} and deck-handling procedures and equipment for the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> without an undercarriage from flexible rubber decks on aircraft carriers. Deletion of the undercarriage would reduce the aircraft weight, allow extra fuel to be carried, and ease deck handling. Despite demonstrating that the technique was feasible, with many landings being made with undercarriage retracted on flexible decks both at RAE Farnborough and on board the carrier HMS Warrior, the proposal was not taken further. Aviation author Geoffrey Cooper quotes author Marriott stating that the rubber deck system [...] "..would have required extensive facilities both aboard ship and at naval air stations to support it. Any gains in aircraft performance were more than cancelled by the complexity and cost of implementation."." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whiting {{sometimes}} {{is referred to}} as the U.S. Navys “father of the aircraft carrier.” He had begun agitating for U.S. Navy development of what were then called [...] "plane carriers" [...] in the spring of 1916, and as early as March 1917 he had proposed to United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels that the Navy acquire a ship with an aircraft catapult and a flight deck, prompting the first serious U.S. Navy consideration of the acquisition of any kind of aviation ship since the American Civil War of 1861–1865. The United States Department of the Navy rejected his proposal on 20 June 1917. In the years between World War I and World War II, however, Whiting would be instrumental in the construction of five of the U.S. Navys first six aircraft carriers and serve as executive officer of its first two. He also served as acting commanding officer of its first carrier at a time when the United States was experimenting with many aspects of the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> carriers and their aircraft.|$|E
