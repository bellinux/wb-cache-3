5|$|Barbara Herzstein {{was born}} in Hollywood, the {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> Nathan Herzstein (1906-1981), a horse-racing columnist, and Melrose Herzstein (née Moore) (1917-2008). Her father's parents were Jews who had emigrated from Hungary and Russia respectively, while her mother, a native of Arkansas, was a Presbyterian of Irish descent.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for Somerset's poor {{performances}} was their inability to consistently field their best players; at least four of their better cricketers were unable to commit to the full fixture list, and in all the county played 30 different people in their eight matches. Faint praise was offered to the batting of William Herbert Fowler, Newton and Edward Sainsbury in The Sportsman, but the bowling was considered by Wisden to be sub-standard, particularly that <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> Fothergill.|$|E
5|$|The 7 {{trillion}} year {{figure was}} first changed to 7 billion {{years and then}} to 3 million and the characters <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> Rimmer and the Cat were created. The name Dave Hollins was changed to Dave Lister when a football player called Dave Hollins became well-known, and Hab was replaced by Holly. One of the voice actors from Son of Cliché, Chris Barrie went on to portray Arnold Rimmer in the Red Dwarf TV series.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious <b>of</b> <b>Arnold,</b> persisted.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{investigation}} <b>of</b> <b>Arnold's</b> claims {{came from}} Lt. Frank Brown and Capt. William Davidson of Hamilton Field in California, who interviewed Arnold on July 12. Arnold also submitted a written report at that time. Regarding the reliability <b>of</b> <b>Arnold's</b> sighting, they concluded: ...|$|R

5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary. The most complete account is that <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> Jacobi (1895) on specimens from Great Natuna (Natuna Islands) and Djemadja (Anamba Islands). Unfortunately, {{although it is}} clear that anatomical differences exist in the two species Jacobi dissected, unfortunately we do not know which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to the two species as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus. However, that is not possible, because in reality Amphidromus chloris is a species found only in the Philippine Islands, and the interruptus phase of A. perversus is not present in the Natuna Islands.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a rhinoplasty, a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} dimple created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> Klein, a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E

5|$|Two Air Corps historians {{state that}} no {{evidence}} exists that the Navy {{was behind the}} order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity, while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction. Deputy chief of staff Embick made {{the claim that the}} restriction had been issued only as a safety measure. Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint Action statement specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them. A fourth historian, in a biography <b>of</b> <b>Arnold,</b> stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, at the insistence of the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} X-rays in 1895, just as {{the studies}} of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain {{of the nature of}} X-rays, but soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of electromagnetic radiation, in other words, another form of light. At that time, the wave model of light—specifically, the Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation—was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in the laboratory <b>of</b> <b>Arnold</b> Sommerfeld suggested that X-rays had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. However, X-rays are composed of photons, and thus are not only waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle-like properties. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of X-rays from electrons. Therefore, these particle-like properties of X-rays, such as their ionization of gases, caused William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that X-rays were not electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed for most scientists that X-rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

50|$|The final {{movement}} {{opens with}} a slightly crazed upbeat character, in the vein <b>of</b> <b>Arnold's</b> lighter orchestral pieces. The string fugato section {{is reminiscent of the}} style of Shostakovich (who had died in the meantime, since the composition <b>of</b> <b>Arnold's</b> previous symphony), but this mood is contrasted by the return of the movement's opening theme in a cocktail-lounge percussive style. The symphony closes with confidence.|$|R
