40|$|The {{relation}} of community socioenvironmental characteristics to {{timing of the}} onset <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality was investigated among the 507 State Economic Areas of the continental United States. Onset <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> was measured using data for White men aged 35 - 74 and classified as early (1968 or before) vs late (after 1968). Ten socioenvironmental characteristics derived from US Census Bureau data were strongly related to onset <b>of</b> <b>decline.</b> Areas with the poorest socioenvironmental conditions were two to 10 {{times more likely to}} experience late onset than those areas with the highest levels. We found that income-related characteristics could account for most of the difference in onset <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> IHD between metropolitan and non-metropolitan places.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect <b>of</b> <b>declining</b> prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices.

40|$|Background: Millennium Development Goal 4 {{calls for}} a {{reduction}} in the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, which corresponds to an annual rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> 4. 4 %. The United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation estimates under-five mortality in every country to measure progress. For the majority of countries, the estimates within a country are based on the assumption of a piece-wise constant rate <b>of</b> <b>decline.</b> Methods and Findings: This paper proposes an alternative method to estimate under-five mortality, such that the underlying rate of change is allowed to vary smoothly over time using a time series model. Information about the average rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> and changes therein is exchanged between countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Cross-validation exercises suggest that the proposed model provides credible bounds for the under-five mortality rate that are reasonably well calibrated during the observation period. The alternative estimates suggest smoother trends in under-five mortality and give new insights into changes in the rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> within countries. Conclusions: The proposed model offers an alternative modeling approach for obtaining estimates of under-five mortality which removes the restriction of a piece-wise linear rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> and introduces hierarchy to exchange information between countries. The newly proposed estimates of the rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> in under- 5 mortality and the uncertaint...|$|R

The red wolf may have originated during a time <b>of</b> <b>declining</b> wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, {{and using}} it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because <b>of</b> <b>declining</b> market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E

40|$|Ninety six middle aged male {{patients}} with chronic bronchitis with relatively well preserved ventilatory function who were resident in Queensland, New South Wales, or Victoria {{took part in a}} prospective study to determine the relationship of various factors to the rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> the FEV 1. Thirty of the subjects withdrew, leaving 66 to be followed for four to six years. The mean rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> the FEV 1 was 58. 6 (SD 51. 4) ml/year. The subjects' ventilatory responses to bronchodilator and to methacholine (measures of bronchial lability) were significantly related {{to each other and to}} sputum eosinophilia. With a linear model for the data on 57 patients who had methacholine and skin tests the rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> the FEV 1 was found, after adjustment had been made for other variables, to be significantly related to State of residence, current smoking, response to bronchodilator, age, and occupational exposure to dust. Response to bronchodilator was interchangeable with response to methacholine. With the five variables in the model none of the following factors was related to the rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> the FEV 1 :FEV 1 on entry, FEV 1 % predicted normal, FEV 1 /VC%, skin test reaction, occupation on entry, history of sinusitis and rhinitis, and height. When data from all 66 subjects were introduced into the model, in addition to the five significant individual variables (FEV 1 /VC% X response to bronchodilator) was significantly related to the rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> the FEV 1. Of these prognostic indices, response to bronchodilator was independent of the initial FEV 1, FEV/VC%, and FEV 1 % predicted. The difference between States, which was not explained by differences due to sampling or withdrawal of subjects, was due to a low rate <b>of</b> <b>decline</b> in Queensland...|$|R
