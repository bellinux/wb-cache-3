5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
40|$|Using primers {{designed}} {{according to}} <b>the</b> published sequence <b>of</b> rice OsCRY 1 a gene, we obtained part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> fragment by PCR and constructed an RNA interference expression vector with it.

5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> {{responsible}} for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis {{are members of the}} homeobox gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes. The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.|$|E
5|$|The EFS gene {{is one of}} {{more than}} 100 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> located in a centromeric 10.21 Mb “minimal {{critical}} region” on Chromosome 14 that are highly expressed in gestational choriocarcinoma. The EFS mRNA was also identified as differentially expressed in two of the three groups of glioblastoma multiforme as identified by gene expression profiles (GEPs). EFS was differentially expressed in the GEP1 and GEP3 groups, which were associated with worse prognosis, with more significant cytogenetic abnormalities and genomic instabilities observed in this groups.|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein <b>of</b> bacteriophage T 7 {{has been}} examined. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein appears to modulate <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 3 endonuclease {{in order to}} prevent <b>the</b> premature degradation <b>of</b> any newly-formed DNA concatemers. This modulation is not however a direct interacton between the two proteins. In single-burst experiments rifamycin can substitute for <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein, allowing formation of fast-sedimenting replicative DNA intermediates and progeny phage production. This suggests that <b>the</b> sole function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein is inhibition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host RNA polymerase and that the latter enzyme directs or promotes <b>the</b> endonucleolytic action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 3 protein...|$|R
50|$|As {{every person}} has two copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A1AT <b>gene,</b> a {{heterozygote}} with two different copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> may have two different bands showing on electrofocusing, although heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> will only show one band.|$|R
50|$|Another {{limitation}} is that conventional (i.e. non-conditional) knockout mice develop in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> being investigated. At times, loss of activity during development may mask <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> in <b>the</b> adult state, especially if <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> {{is involved in}} numerous processes spanning development. Conditional/inducible mutation approaches are then required that first allow the mouse to develop and mature normally prior to ablation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in the human genome, operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes {{are called the}} developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E
5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E
40|$|Suppose one {{chromosome}} in {{one member}} of a population somehow acquires a duplicate copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene,</b> fully linked to <b>the</b> original <b>gene</b> 2 ̆ 7 s locus. Preservation is the event that eventually every chromosome in the population is a descendant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one which initially carried the duplicate. For a haploid population in which <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> all copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is lethal, <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> preservation has recently been estimated via a diffusion approximation. That approximation is shown to carry over to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> diploids and arbitrary strong selection against <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> techniques used lead to some new results. In the large population limit, it is shown that the relative probability that descendants of {{a small number of}} individuals carrying multiple copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> fix in <b>the</b> population is proportional to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> copies carried. <b>The</b> probability <b>of</b> preservation is approximated when chromosomes carrying two copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> are subject to additional, fully non-functionalizing mutations, thereby modelling either an additional cost of replicating a longer genome, or a partial duplication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> In <b>the</b> latter case the preservation probability depends only on the mutation rate to null for <b>the</b> duplicated portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E
5|$|The {{four types}} of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the {{four types of}} flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} present in humans since antiquity. The {{earliest}} unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves {{evidence of the}} disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then was transferred to humans, or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear. A comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as was previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution. Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000–2400 BC. Genetic studies suggest TB was present in the Americas from about 100 AD.|$|E
