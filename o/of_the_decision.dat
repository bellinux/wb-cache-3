5|$|After a {{successful}} appeal by the British, judges reversed {{the result of}} the match, granting Sarah Stevenson two points for a final round kick to her opponent's head which the judges had previously missed. The reversal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision,</b> after video footage was considered, is thought to be a first for the sport. Another British hopeful, Aaron Cook, was also unhappy with the judges after losing out on bronze in the men's −80kg.|$|E
5|$|As Canada's {{starting}} goalkeeper at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany, McLeod {{appeared in}} two of three matches in the group stage, allowing six goals. Despite an impressive effort, the Canadian team did not advance past the group stage and finished last. Some have stated that the team was burned out following the extensive residency program {{leading up to the}} World Cup. Players were also critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> of head coach Carolina Morace to hold the camp in Italy as opposed to Canada. Following the tournament, McLeod appeared in two friendlies against the United States and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was {{deactivated}} on 1 August 1951 {{while it was}} still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, AOL {{merged with}} Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Time Warner's {{market share of}} the music {{industry}} had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label.

The BID lasts initially for five years, and between 2013 and 2018 the projects being undertaken include business support, security projects, town promotion, the provision of green spaces and making the town more visually attractive.|$|E

5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder and sentenced her {{to life in prison}} with the {{possibility}} of parole after 30 years in 2025. Life with the possibility of parole was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time. In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay. Fans and historians disapproved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.|$|E

James left CAA for Paul in 2012. James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin.

5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. The Court said the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of standing prevents applicants from burdening {{the court with}} frivolous or vexatious claims. This minimizes disruption in the administrative process. When an administrative decision by a public authority is challenged, implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> by the authority may be delayed. Therefore, the courts want to restrict access to applicants who have a genuine interest in challenging the decision. Furthermore, since the courts' resources are limited, restricting access to genuine claims ensures that judicial resources are appropriately allocated.|$|E
