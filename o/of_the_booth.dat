5|$|The Square {{has been}} the home for TKTS (originally known as the Official London Half-Price Theatre Ticket Booth), since 1980. Tickets for theatre {{performances}} taking place around the West End that day and during the week are sold from the booth at a significant discount. The popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> {{has given rise to}} other booths and stores around the Square that advertise half-price tickets for West End shows. The Official London Theatre Guide recommends avoiding these booths as they are not official and do not contain the Society of Ticket Agents & Retailers (STAR) logo.|$|E
5|$|Alster {{was passed}} to the MoWT and renamed Empire Endurance. The United Kingdom Official Number 164841 and Code Letters GMJJ were allocated. Her port of {{registry}} was Middlesbrough. She was placed under the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Booth</b> Steamship Co Ltd. Empire Endurance {{was a member of}} Convoy FN 255, which departed from Southend, Essex on 17 August and arrived at Methil, Fife two days later. She then joined Convoy OA 202, which departed on 21 August and dispersed at sea on 25 August. Her destination was Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where she arrived on 3 September. Empire Endurance sailed on 12 September for Sydney, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, arriving three days later. She then joined Convoy HX 74, which departed from Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 September and arrived at Liverpool, Lancashire, United Kingdom on 2 October. She was carrying general cargo stated to be bound for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland. She left the convoy at the Clyde on 2 October.|$|E

She was placed under the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Booth</b> Steamship Co Ltd. Empire Chamois {{was a member of a}} number of convoys during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The manor of Staley {{remained}} in the possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Booth</b> family until the death of George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington on 2 August 1758. Upon his death, the Earldom of Warrington became extinct. His only daughter, Lady Mary Booth, the wife of Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford, inherited all the Booth estates. The manor of Staley was owned by the Grey family until the extinction of the Earldom of Stamford {{on the death of}} Roger Grey, 10th Earl of Stamford in 1976. At this point, the family estates were dispersed. Stamford Street, Grey Street, Groby Street, Stamford Park, Stamford Golf Club and the two Stamford Arms public houses in Stalybridge are all named after the Grey family.|$|E
500|$|The {{area which}} {{collapsed}} included two kiosks. The deceased {{had been a}} lottery kiosk employee and her customer. [...] Lucie Aylwin, 37, worked just once {{a week at the}} lottery booth, earning extra money for her wedding. Aylwin held a full-time job with Collège Boréal, a French language college, as an employment consultant and recruiter in the college's 'Employment Options Emploi' office, located elsewhere in the Algo Centre Mall. [...] Doloris Perizzolo, 74, was a widow and mother believed to be opening pull-tab lottery tickets, which must be opened in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> operator. After the bodies of the two victims were retrieved, and HUSAR confirmed no other victims were trapped in the rubble, efforts shifted to official investigations.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] was created with an unknown release date. The video begins with Durand {{walking into a}} futuristic photo booth located in an open space {{surrounded}} by lanterns, while shots of the Ivy members, who are outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth,</b> are displayed. As Durand continues singing, several individuals enter and exit the room while getting their picture taken, each leaving with a CD in their hand.

500|$|The Manor of Barton-upon-Irwell once {{covered a}} large area; in 1276 it {{included}} townships such as Asphull, Halghton, Halliwelle, Farnword, Eccles, Workedele, Withington (latterly Winton), Irwelham, Hulm, Quicklewicke, Suynhul and Swinton. Before this date {{it would appear}} to have been even larger, but by 1320 the manor boundaries were described as [...] "Tordhale Siche descending to Caldebroc, then to the pit near Preste Platteforde and then to another pit, then to the ditch of Roger the Clerk, then to the hedge of Richard the Rimeur, then following the hedge to Caldebroc." [...] The manor was originally controlled by the Barton family until about 1292 when by marriage it came into the ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Booth</b> family, who retained it for almost 300years. In 1586 the Trafford family assumed control of the manor, and established themselves in 1632 at Whittleswick, which was renamed Trafford Park.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} <b>the</b> technological history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photo <b>booth</b> {{and photo}} booth photography {{as a social}} and artistic practice. Each chapter focuses on a different subject relating to significant characteristics of photo booth photography. Taking photos in a photo booth is a deliberate act and {{can be considered as}} a significant experience. Therefore, the first chapter reflects on this process and considers <b>the</b> photo <b>booth</b> strip as photo-object and memory object. Subsequently the focus shifts towards <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image: the self-portrait. <b>The</b> photo <b>booth</b> is widely known as a machine to take identification photos with. In the second chapter I shall address this subject, to be discussed within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> identity. Upon entering a photo booth, one goes into a secluded environment, which evokes a feeling <b>of</b> privacy. <b>The</b> <b>booths,</b> however, are often located in public space. The third and final chapter of this thesis will focus on this contradiction and discuss <b>the</b> photo <b>booth</b> and its products in relation to <b>the</b> notions <b>of</b> private and public, and more specifically how this relation has changed under <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> digitalisation. Every chapter begins to discuss <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photo <b>booth</b> by regular users, to further investigate the topics through <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> artistic practices...|$|R
25|$|In 2003 the Dartford Crossing {{construction}} {{debt was}} paid off, {{which should have}} resulted in <b>the</b> scrapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toll fee to cross. However, the government decided to continue to charge most crossing users to keep congestion levels down. Ironically, since <b>the</b> upgrading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossing doubled capacity in terms of road lanes, but did not add extra toll <b>booths,</b> it is <b>the</b> toll <b>booths</b> themselves {{that are responsible for}} lengthy queues at peak times, and removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> would almost certainly reduce congestion. As with congestion charging schemes, all proceeds must be used for transport purposes. In one year this money amounted to £60 million.|$|R

2500|$|Another of {{the primary}} sets was the radio studio at KACL from which Frasier {{broadcasts}} his show. The studio itself consists of two rooms: the broadcast booth and the control room. A section of the corridor outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth</b> was also built (visible through the windows {{at the back of}} the studio) and could be shot from the side to view the corridor itself. The set was designed based on ABC's then-brand-new radio studios in Los Angeles which the production designer visited. Technical elements such as the microphones were regularly updated to conform with the latest technology. Although the studio set lacked a [...] "front" [...] wall (the fourth wall), one was built for occasional use in [...] episodes with certain moments shot from behind the broadcast desk, rather than in front of it as usual.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the polls}} close at 6pm on {{election}} day, {{the votes are}} counted. The count is conducted by officers of the Australian Electoral Commission, watched by nominated volunteer observers from the political parties, called scrutineers, who are entitled to observe the whole voting process from the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booth.</b> The votes from each polling booth in the electorate are tallied {{at the office of}} the returning officer for the electorate. If one of the candidates has more than 50% of the vote, then they are declared elected. Australian politics are influenced by social and economic demographics, though the correlation between [...] "class" [...] and voting is not always simple. Typically, the National Party will poll higher in rural seats. The Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party are not as easily generalised. In a strong seat, the elected party might win up to 80% of the two-party-preferred vote. [...] In the 2004 federal election, the highest winning margin in a seat was 25.1%, with most seats won by a margin of less than 10%.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, using a microsimulation model, queues of Fatih Sultan Mehmet (FSM) Bridge toll booths are analyzed. Generally two queues form in {{the study}} area. First one is in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> and <b>the</b> second one is after <b>the</b> <b>booths,</b> due to <b>the</b> {{existing}} bottleneck between <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> and <b>the</b> Bridge. Queue/delay performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system is analyzed incorporating the queuing theory. According to demand and service time of each server, queue may occur before <b>the</b> <b>booths</b> and/or before <b>the</b> bottleneck. <b>The</b> propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second queue may overlap the first one because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottleneck capacity and for sure the increasing demand. Four different scenarios are simulated in order to evaluate capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toll collectors and the bottleneck section. Some traffic management strategies are applied to improve <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> service by decreasing delays and increasing capacities. In each scenario, average delay time per vehicle, average travel time, occupancy and speed data are obtained with microsimulation software, Vissim. Finally, optimum number of toll collectors is determined by seeking to minimize delays and maximize bottleneck capacity...|$|R
