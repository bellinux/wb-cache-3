500|$|As {{the title}} indicates, {{it sought to}} {{distance}} itself from New Age politics. [...] If the term [...] "New Age" [...] suggests utopianism, the term [...] "radical middle" [...] suggests, for Satin and others, keeping at least one foot firmly on the ground. [...] Satin attempted to embrace the promise but also the balance implied by the term. [...] One feature story is entitled [...] "Tough <b>on</b> <b>Terrorism,</b> <b>and</b> Tough on the Causes of Terrorism". [...] Another feature story attempts to go beyond polarized positions on biotechnology. [...] Another argues that corporate activity abroad can best be seen as neither inherently moral nor inherently imperialistic, but as a [...] "chance for mutual learning". [...] The board of advisors of Radical Middle Newsletter signaled Satin's new direction. [...] It was politically diverse, {{and many of its}} members sought to promote dialogue or collaboration across ideological divides. [...] By the end of 2004 it included John Avlon, Don Edward Beck, Jerry H. Bentley, Esther Dyson, Mark P. Painter, Shelley Alpern of the Social Investment Forum, James Fallows of the New America Foundation, Jane Mansbridge of the Harvard Kennedy School, John D.

[...] Commenting on the term [...] "shock and awe" [...] in the film, Cameron said: [...] "We {{know what it feels like}} to launch the missiles. [...] We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war <b>on</b> <b>terrorism</b> <b>and</b> puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E
