40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} to {{construct}} graph theoretical models <b>of</b> n-dimensional <b>continuous</b> objects and manifolds. These models retain topological properties <b>of</b> their <b>continuous</b> counterparts. An LCL collection of n-cells in Euclidean space is introduced and investigated. If an LCL collection of n-cells is a cover <b>of</b> a <b>continuous</b> n-dimensional manifold then the intersection graph of this cover is a digital closed n-dimensional manifold {{with the same}} topology as its continuous counterpart. As an example, we prove that the digital model <b>of</b> a <b>continuous</b> n-dimensional sphere is a digital n-sphere with at least 2 n+ 2 points, the digital model <b>of</b> a <b>continuous</b> projective plane is a digital projective plane with at least eleven points, the digital model <b>of</b> a <b>continuous</b> Klein bottle is the digital Klein bottle with at least sixteen points, the digital model <b>of</b> a <b>continuous</b> torus is the digital torus with at least sixteen points and the digital model <b>of</b> a <b>continuous</b> Moebius band is the digital Moebius band with at least twelve points.
