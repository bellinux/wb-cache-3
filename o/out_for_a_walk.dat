5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> {{was the best way}} to make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Williams {{was wounded}} in a drive-by {{shooting}} in Compton {{by members of the}} Bloods. While sitting on the porch of his house one evening as he'd let his dog <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> a carload of Bloods drove by the house and opened fire on Williams. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove from the porch and {{was wounded in}} both of his legs. Despite being told by doctors that he would never walk again, Williams began a nearly year-long process of physical rehabilitation and an intense workout regimen, ultimately regaining his ability to walk.|$|E

60|$|I {{jumped out}} of bed, and rang for the old nurse. Was Lucilla at home? No: she had gone <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>walk.</b> By herself? Yes--by herself. In what direction? Up the valley, towards Browndown.|$|R
25|$|While <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> Marianne {{gets caught}} {{in the rain and}} slips and sprains her ankle. The dashing John Willoughby sees the {{accident}} and assists her. Marianne quickly comes to admire his good looks and outspoken views on poetry, music, art, and love. His attentions lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the couple have become secretly engaged. Elinor cautions Marianne against her unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to check her emotions. Abruptly, Mr Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow.|$|E
25|$|Just before 3 pm Kelly's superior, Wing Commander Clark, {{called him}} at home and spoke to him for 6-7 minutes. Clark called again at about 3:20 pm; the call was {{answered}} by Mrs Kelly who said that Kelly had gone <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> as he did every day. He appears to have gone directly to an area of woodlands known as Harrowdown Hill {{about a mile away}} from his home where he ingested up to 29 tablets of painkillers, co-proxamol, an analgesic drug and to have then cut his left wrist with a knife he had owned since his youth. His wife reported him missing shortly after midnight that night, and he was found early the next morning. Questioned on a flight to Hong Kong that day, Blair denied that anyone had been authorised to leak Kelly's identity.|$|E
25|$|In season two of Legacy, Eric Steinberg portrayed Bi-Han {{while his}} brother Kuai Liang was played by Harry Shum. The {{relationship}} between Bi-Han and Hanzo is further explored, {{as they were}} childhood friends driven apart by the preexisting rivalry between their two clans, {{as well as the}} jealousy of Kuai Liang. When they become adults, Kuai Liang threatens Hanzo and his family while <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> and Hanzo is forced to kill Kuai Liang. Bi-Han, believing Hanzo was protecting his family, decides to end the feud between their two clans out of respect for his friend. He becomes saddened and enraged over the fact that his clan had supposedly killed Hanzo, his family, and his clan. He then discovers that Quan Chi had impersonated him. Having been chosen to fight for Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat, he encounters Hanzo on the battlefield. Bi-Han's efforts to explain himself to Hanzo are fruitless, as Hanzo is now an undead specter only responding to the name Scorpion, who then kills Bi-Han by ripping out his spine.|$|E

25|$|In late 2009 Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) {{informed}} {{recently discovered}} half sister Morgan Braithwaite (Bonnie Soper) {{that her family}} were eager to meet her, primarily her mother, Leanne. Several months after Morgans untimely death, Nicole's ex-girlfriend Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne) and Gerald Tippett (Harry McNaughton) visited Tauranga to find a recently runaway Nicole and ended up staying at Leanne's house. Nicole and Maia were forced to keep their relationship private due to Leanne's conservative nature but when Nicole eventually came out, Leanne disowned her unless she dumped Maia permanently. Nicole at first accepted but later fled Tauranga and reunited with Maia in Ferndale. The following year Leanne arrived in Ferndale and pronounced her new pro-gay attitude, showing open approval of Nicole and Maia's relationship. However, after discovering Maia had cheated on Nicole, Leanne set about sabotaging the two and tried to set Nicole up with both Hunter McKay (Lee Donoghue) and Maxwell Avia (Robbie Magasiva). Whilst <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> Leanne was mugged and injured, extending her stay in Ferndale that eventually saw her receive a job as the hospital receptionist. However Leanne soon realised she was holding Nicole back from a relationship and returned to Tauranga.|$|E
25|$|Poirot sends his valet out {{investigating}} {{and finds}} an address which confirms Poirot's suspicions {{of where it}} would be and what he would find there. Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a Pekingese dog, Augustus. They are part of a scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find {{his way back to the}} sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the 'crime'. The 'subject' of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and their owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent out with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis of the way they are treated by their employers – only the other day Lady Hoggin accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady Hoggin although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police.|$|E
25|$|Poirot is {{diverted}} {{to stay in}} an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he doesn't appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing {{in front of the}} fire in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic who is trying to repair the car. The young man – Ted Williamson – is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called 'Grasslawn' to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> with her and she said she would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita – but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and was told the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-haired and bad-tempered, whereas the girl Williamson described was golden-haired. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. He also speaks with the owner of 'Grasslawn', Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie – with some unease – but doesn't recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she knows something of Sir George that Poirot would like to know, but the detective doesn't take up the offer, much to her annoyance.|$|E
60|$|These same {{fields were}} {{opposite}} the Wilfer premises. The discreet Mrs Wilfer now {{looking out of}} window and beholding her daughter in conference with her lodger, instantly tied up her head and came <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> casual <b>walk.</b>|$|R

500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by going <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E
500|$|Clinton gave {{testimony}} to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Williams {{waiting for his}} laundry {{to be done in}} a store, before getting <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk.</b> Meanwhile, Barlow is {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the street. As the song starts the two of them start walking towards their cars whilst looking at each other. When they get inside, the scenes are intercut with the two of them dancing with their female partners. Later in the video, they are shown sitting at the bar having a drink whilst singing the song's words. As the second chorus starts, Williams and Barlow are at a pond, fishing and laughing. Scenes of them looking each other secretly are also shown. In the middle of [...] "Shame"'s bridge they start taking their shirts off. Shortly, they are shown climbing up a cliffs. After they get on the top they want to jump, however, they realize it's too high. Instead they hug each other and walk away as the video finishes.|$|E

500|$|Tolle recalls going <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> in London {{the next}} morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, {{and he began}} to feel a strong {{underlying}} sense of peace in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching the world go by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. <b>Out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E

Upon {{his return}} to the hotel, he found that shopkeepers were closing their shutters early, and then noticed that several buildings were ablaze. Fire engines were present, but the crowd was not permitting them to be used. Increasingly alarmed, Fremantle saw a black youth pursued by the mob, eventually finding refuge with a company of soldiers, to the disgust of the massed protestors. Bewildered, the Englishman asked a bystander why the crowds were so vehement in their hatred of blacks. [...] In response, he was told that they were 'the innocent cause of all these troubles'.|$|E
2500|$|She used {{incidents}} {{from her}} own and her husband's life to illustrate how they handled the racism they faced.

In another essay she tells of being blocked {{by a group of}} white men as {{she and her husband were}} <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> in Nevada City. [...] "I addressed them in this wise", she wrote: [...] "'Gentlemen, Fenians, illustrious sons of the dominant race of Anglo-Saxons, bold advocates of a white man's Government, supporters of Andy Johnson—will you tell me if a herring and a half cost a penny and a half, how much will eleven pence buy?'
