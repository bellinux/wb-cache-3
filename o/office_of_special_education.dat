40|$|The {{presence}} of challenging and violent behaviors that pose {{risks to the}} overall safety and the educational learning experience in the public education setting {{have been on the}} rise in recent years. Traditional reactive, coercive, and punitive measures to address these behaviors have been futile. Congress responded to the national increase in violent behaviors by implementing several acts, including zero tolerance policies, in an effort to diminish the rise in violent behaviors. Of significance to this study was the inclusion of Functional Behavior Assessment in the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997. Unfortunately, FBA has the least legal grounding of all the disciplinary provisions of IDEA and has been questioned by experts in the field if sufficient empirical support exists for the generalization of the technology to all students and whether or not school personnel have the skills required to conduct FBA with integrity (Drasgow, Yell, Bradley, 2 ̆ 6 Shriner 1999; Quinn, 2000; Scott et al., 2005; Skiba, 2002). The purpose of this research study was to obtain and analyze information regarding the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers in the Commonwealth of Virginia on the use of Functional Behavior Assessment with students with high incidence disabilities in public schools. A nonexperimental survey design using an online self-report survey was conducted with <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers in the eight superintendent regions in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The study examined the behaviors that most frequently prompt a FBA, if a relationship exists between the type and frequency of training and the perceived effectiveness of FBA, the relationship between teacher attributes of beliefs and self-efficacy and the overall perceived effectiveness of FBA, and how teachers perceive the overall FBA/BIP process in public schools. The survey was distributed electronically to <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers through the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> director in each of the 132 school divisions in Virginia. A total <b>of</b> 373 <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers responded to the survey. Respondents perceive the extent to which FBA contributes to the effectiveness of interventions that reduce challenging behaviors of students and the effectiveness of current FBA methods in increasing positive replacement behaviors and improving learning/academic achievement in public schools moderately effective. Congruent with the literature, <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers reported that chronic problem behaviors and physically aggressive behaviors were most likely to prompt an FBA. Respondents indicated their knowledge base, training experiences, and background in FBA. Overall, the majority <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers reported that the training that they have received in FBA was moderately to very effective. Respondents indicated that further training in all areas of FBA was needed using a dynamic team based process with post training support. The most frequently reported area of FBA that requires more training was developing function-based interventions while the least reported area of need was developing hypotheses about the functions of the behavior. Teacher beliefs and self-efficacy were examined to determine if these attributes predict a special educator’s perceived effectiveness of FBA. High levels of teacher self-efficacy were associated with increased views of perceived effectiveness of FBA in public schools. Two belief items were found to correlate with the perceived effectiveness of FBA. The results of this study have important implications for personnel development and training for future and current special educators as well as information that {{can be applied to the}} exploration of a standardized process for conducting FBA in public schools in Virginia...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{perceptions}} <b>of</b> directors <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> cooperatives and superintendents in determining the actual and ideal role <b>of</b> the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> director in-the State of Indiana. The population consisted of fifty-seven directors and forty-two superintendents. A twenty-five item questionnaire containing statements pertaining to the role of the director <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> was utilized. Two null hypotheses were tested by using Chi-square. The. 05 level of significance was established as the critical probability level for the nonacceptance of hypotheses. Findings 1. Directors <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> and superintendents indicated agreement in perception on fifteen of the twenty-five items of the questionnaire regarding the director having actual responsibility and authority and ideal [...] having responsibility and authority. 2. Of the sixteen significant findings, ten were in the authority dimension of the questionnaire. 3. Directors <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> perceived the role <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> director as ideally having more authority to prepare the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> budget, approve expenditures, assign and supervise <b>special</b> <b>education</b> personnel, determine types of programing alternatives to be offered in the instructional program, keep staff informed of current trends, methods, procedures, rules and regulations, and allocate existing physical space for <b>special</b> <b>education</b> programs. 4. Superintendents perceived the role <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> director as having more actual responsibility to determine transportation needs for the program, receive, initiate and process psychological diagnostic services, conduct procedures for reviewing handicapped student's program, and develop, implement and supervise curriculum for <b>special</b> <b>education</b> programs. Conclusions 1. A conflict in role perception between directors <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> and superintendents generally does not exist. 2. Differences in role perception will more often result from conflict over authority. 3. Determining transportation needs for the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> program will probably result in role conflict between directors <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> and superintendents.
