500|$|The album artwork for Mediocre {{meant to}} emulate the theme of mediocrity. Sariñana elaborated, [...] "The cover is a take {{on the idea that}} women in the ‘40s and ‘50s had to be ‘perfect.’ Perfect hair, perfect clothes, sitting quietly and making perfect meals and {{embroidering}} perfectly. And, ironically, they were all perfect in the same, uninteresting way so that ended up making them all mediocre. That was the idea." [...] Sariñana stressed that she did not intend to produce mediocre content for the album: [...] "It’s {{not to say that the}} material is mediocre, but rather that it’s a message of irony, and I think the public gets that, but there are some people <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who</b> like to poke fun at the title." ...|$|E

Axel Alonso denied the character was created out of political correctness, stating [...] "Simple fact is Marvel comics reflect the world in all its shapes, sizes and colors.

500|$|Inspired by Badu's {{creativity}} and their time listening to music, Chavarria added special effects and delays to the tracks by using and manipulating {{a variety of}} plug-ins and guitar pedals, subsequently reworking effects frequency and modulation parameters. Chavarria said {{they were able to}} expand on the producers' tracks rather than change them, because [...] "Erykah made this record to display to the world that there is this whole group of producers <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who</b> are outside of the mainstream making great music." [...] Badu said of the approach, [...] "I work in layers. The first layer is the track. The second layer is the songs. The third would be the musicians who add a certain nuance.

Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years.

5000|$|In {{the modern}} era of power tennis, Connors style of play has often been cited as highly influential, {{especially}} {{in the development of}} the flat backhand.

It is difficult to say which was more instrumental in Connors becoming a champion. ... Though smaller than most of his competitors, Connors didn't let it bother him, making up for a lack of size with determination." [...] Of his own competitive nature Connors has said, [...] "There's always somebody <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who's</b> willing to push it that extra inch, or mile, and that was me. (Laughter) I didn't care if it took me 30 minutes or five hours. If you beat me, you had to be the best, or the best you had that day. But that was my passion for the game.
