5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory {{address of the}} <b>operand</b> to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single <b>operand</b> architecture meant that the second <b>operand</b> of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E
5|$|The machine's {{instruction}} set was increased from the 7 of the SSEM to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware. This increased to 30instructions in the Final Specification version. Ten bits of each word were allocated {{to hold the}} instruction code. The standard instruction time was 1.8 milliseconds, but multiplication was much slower, {{depending on the size}} of the <b>operand.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the C and C++ {{programming}} languages, the comma operator (represented by the token ,) is {{a binary}} operator that evaluates its first <b>operand</b> and discards the result, and then evaluates the second <b>operand</b> and returns this value (and type).|$|E
50|$|Instructions {{that need}} more than three <b>operands</b> have an extra suffix byte specifying one or two {{additional}} register <b>operands.</b> Instructions coded with the VEX prefix can have up to five <b>operands.</b> At most one of the <b>operands</b> can be a memory operand; and at most one of the <b>operands</b> can be an immediate constant of 4 or 8 bits. The remaining <b>operands</b> are registers.|$|R
5000|$|It allows {{instruction}} {{codes to}} {{have up to}} five <b>operands,</b> where the original scheme allows only two <b>operands</b> (in rare cases three <b>operands).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinction}} between open and closed <b>operands</b> (<b>operands</b> = arguments + target) {{corresponds to the}} {{distinction between}} bound and free variables in lambda calculus. An agent expression such as [...] with some <b>operands</b> closed and some open corresponds to {{a version of the}} original operation curried on the closed <b>operands.</b>|$|R
25|$|Like many CPUs of its era {{the cycle}} timing of some {{instructions}} varied {{depending on the}} source operand(s). For example, the unsigned multiply instruction takes (38+2n) clock cycles to complete where 'n' {{is equal to the}} number of bits set in the <b>operand.</b> To create a function that took a fixed cycle count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each bit that wasn't set in the original multiplication <b>operand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Number of {{instructions:}} 39 types from a 4-bit op code {{by using}} five {{bits of the}} <b>operand</b> address field for instructions which do not access memory.|$|E
25|$|Associated {{with every}} term {{is a natural}} number called its height. Atoms are of zero height, while {{applications}} are of height one plus the height of their highest <b>operand.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 11111: three {{additional}} <b>operands,</b> {{in addition to}} the <b>operands</b> of the following register instruction ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Operands</b> may be complex, and may {{consist of}} {{expressions}} also {{made up of}} operators with <b>operands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Less {{frequently}} used instructions are encoded in 32 bits. 32-bit instructions allow 16- or 20-bit immediate <b>operands</b> (such as far branches), {{up to six}} register <b>operands</b> (for example long multiply which has four source and two destination <b>operands)</b> and additional opcode space for rarely used instructions.|$|R
25|$|The Alpha {{does not}} have {{condition}} codes for integer instructions to remove a potential bottleneck at the condition status register. Instructions resulting in an overflow, such as adding two numbers whose result does not fit in 64 bits, write the 32 or 64 least significant bits to the destination register. The carry is generated by performing an unsigned compare on the result with either <b>operand</b> {{to see if the}} result is smaller than either <b>operand.</b> If the test was true, the value one is written to the least significant bit of the destination register to indicate the condition.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} is an exception, it is a valid number in regular two's {{complement}} systems. All arithmetic operations work with it both as an <b>operand</b> and (unless there was an overflow) a result.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that for}} (A0)+ and -(A0), the actual {{increment}} or decrement value {{is dependent on}} the <b>operand</b> size: a byte access increments the address register by 1, a word by 2, and a long by 4.|$|E
5000|$|Addition is {{a binary}} operation, {{which means it}} has two <b>operands.</b> In C++, the {{arguments}} being passed are the <b>operands,</b> and the [...] object is the returned value.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes a}} low power {{software}} optimization technique for processor-based embedded systems. A basic {{idea is to}} reduce switching activities in sign extension bits of instruction <b>operands</b> through shifting the <b>operands.</b> Our technique, called shift operation insertion technique in this paper, consists of following three steps: 1) shift <b>operands</b> from LSB side toward MSB side by optimal shift amount, 2) execute instructions with the shifted <b>operands,</b> and 3) shift back computational results to original positions. Experimental results show about 10. 7 % energy reduction of datapath, and about 5. 5 % energy reduction of overall processor. I...|$|R
50|$|Decoding the op-code in the {{instruction}} register includes determining {{the instruction}}, determining where its <b>operands</b> are in memory, retrieving the <b>operands</b> from memory, allocating processor resources {{to execute the}} command (in superscalar processors), etc.|$|R
25|$|The machine {{description}} file contains RTL patterns, {{along with}} <b>operand</b> constraints, and code snippets to output the final assembly. The constraints {{indicate that a}} particular RTL pattern might only apply (for example) to certain hardware registers, or (for example) allow immediate <b>operand</b> offsets of only a limited size (e.g. 12, 16, 24, … bit offsets, etc.). During RTL generation, the constraints for the given target architecture are checked. In order to issue a given snippet of RTL, it must match one (or more) of the RTL patterns in the machine description file, and satisfy the constraints for that pattern; otherwise, {{it would be impossible}} to convert the final RTL into machine code.|$|E
25|$|More subtly, {{we should}} be able to {{determine}} our next action based on the results of previous actions. To do this, Haskell has an operator >>= (pronounced bind) with type IO a → (a → IOnbsp&b) → IOnbsp&b. That is, the <b>operand</b> on the left is an I/O action that returns a value of type a; the <b>operand</b> on the right is a function that can pick an I/O action based on the value produced by the action on the left. The resulting combined action, when performed, performs the first action, then evaluates the function with the first action's return value, then performs the second action, and finally returns the second action's value.|$|E
25|$|The integer literal {{format is}} used by integer {{instructions}} which use a literal {{as one of the}} operands. The format {{is the same as the}} integer operate format except for the replacement of the 5-bit Rb field and the 3 bits of unused space with an 8-bit literal field which is zero-extended to a 64-bit <b>operand.</b>|$|E
50|$|Logical {{equality}} is an operation on two logical values, typically {{the values of}} two propositions, that produces a value of true {{if and only if}} both <b>operands</b> are false or both <b>operands</b> are true.|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, three-address code (often {{abbreviated to}} TAC or 3AC) is an intermediate code used by optimizing compilers {{to aid in}} the implementation of code-improving transformations. Each TAC instruction has at most three <b>operands</b> and is typically a combination of assignment and a binary operator. For example, [...] The name derives from the use of three <b>operands</b> in these statements even though instructions with fewer <b>operands</b> may occur.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Operands</b> for {{arithmetic}} or logical {{operations are}} most often placed into registers and operated on there. However, in some situations the <b>operands</b> may be stacked up to an arbitrary depth, which means something more than registers must be used (this {{is the case of}} register spilling). The stack of such <b>operands,</b> rather like that in an RPN calculator, is called an evaluation stack, and may occupy space in the call stack.|$|R
25|$|GP evolves {{computer}} programs, traditionally {{represented in}} memory as tree structures. Trees {{can be easily}} evaluated in a recursive manner. Every tree node has an operator function and every terminal node has an <b>operand,</b> making mathematical expressions easy to evolve and evaluate. Thus traditionally GP favors the use of programming languages that naturally embody tree structures (for example, Lisp; other functional programming languages are also suitable).|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{code and}} data caches lessens the fetch and <b>operand</b> read/write {{conflicts}} {{compared to the}} 486. To reduce access time and implementation cost, {{both of them are}} 2-way associative, instead of the single 4-way cache of the 486. A related enhancement in the Pentium is the ability to read a contiguous block from the code cache even when it is split between two cache lines (at least 17 bytes in worst case).|$|E
25|$|INDEX: Add {{the data}} {{retrieved}} at the address {{specified by the}} instruction to the next instruction. INDEX {{can be used to}} add or subtract an index value to the base address specified by the <b>operand</b> of the instruction that follows INDEX. This method is used to implement arrays and table look-ups; since the addition was done on both whole words, it was also used to modify the op. code in a following (extracode) instruction, and on rare occasions both functions at once.|$|E
50|$|Logical {{equality}} (also {{known as}} biconditional) is an operation on two logical values, typically {{the values of}} two propositions, that produces a value of true if both <b>operands</b> are false or both <b>operands</b> are true.|$|R
50|$|In {{the above}} expression, the {{multiplication}} operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has <b>operands</b> of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has <b>operands</b> of '3' and '5 × 2'.|$|R

25|$|X# {{can work}} with three {{low-level}} data structures: the registers, the stack and the memory, on different ports. The registers are the base of all normal operations for X#. A register can be copied to another by writing DST = SRC as opposed to mov or load/store instructions. Registers can be incremented or decremented just as easily. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are written as dest op src where src is a constant, variable, or register, and dest is both an <b>operand</b> and the location where the result is stored.|$|E
25|$|Many second-generation CPUs {{delegated}} {{peripheral device}} communications to a secondary processor. For example, while the communication processor controlled card reading and punching, the main CPU executed calculations and binary branch instructions. One databus would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU's fetch-execute cycle rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the PDP-1, the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took {{at least two}} memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the <b>operand</b> data fetch.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} obscure {{design in}} the West, it was {{a radical departure from}} NEC's previous V-series CPUs—the NEC V20-V50 series—, which were based on the Intel x86 model, although it retained the ability to emulate them. According to NEC's documentation, the architectural change was made due to the increasing demand and diversity of programs, calling for a processor with both power (the 32-bit internal bus) and flexibility, having large numbers of general-purpose registers—a common feature of RISC architectures and a benefit to the emerging high-level languages. The V60 architecture retained however CISC features (which its manual describe as mainframe-based) like variable-length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex <b>operand</b> addressing schemes.|$|E
5000|$|Reverse Polish {{notation}} (RPN), {{also known}} as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their <b>operands,</b> in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their <b>operands.</b> It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of <b>operands.</b> The description [...] "Polish" [...] refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.|$|R

50|$|AVX {{introduces}} a three-operand SIMD instruction format, where the destination register {{is distinct from}} the two source <b>operands.</b> For example, an SSE instruction using the conventional two-operand form a = a + b can now use a non-destructive three-operand form c = a + b, preserving both source <b>operands.</b> AVX's three-operand format {{is limited to the}} instructions with SIMD <b>operands</b> (YMM), and does not include instructions with general purpose registers (e.g. EAX). Such support will first appear in AVX2.|$|R
