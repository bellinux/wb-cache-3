5|$|The 1973 war {{convinced}} the Israelis {{of the necessity}} of negotiations with the Arabs. This unprecedented willingness, coupled with Sadat's diplomatic initiatives and intercession by the United States to break barriers of mistrust between Egypt and Israel, made possible the long series <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> between both nations. The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements, and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{studies the}} climate <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> during the US Presidential {{election}} debates 2016 from a perspective <b>of</b> Deliberative democratic <b>discussion</b> criteria. It uses a statistical analysis {{to examine and}} describe the climate <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> during the debates. The criteria {{are based on the}} theoretical work of James S. Fishkin and Robert C. Luskin, which closely points out five compontents/factors needed to get a healthy and reasonable climate <b>of</b> <b>discussion.</b> The essay suggests that the climate <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> during the US elections has taken place on two different “battleground” (Outside and Inside formal debating forums). It further suggests that outside climate <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> has been dominated by ugly tricks and “dirty talking” and the inside formal debating forums climate <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> has been reasonable and healthy. The results of the analysis show that the US Presidential election debates have broken this pattern, mainly due to the republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump...|$|R

5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to move them to French possessions like Martinique where they would be outside the reach of the Axis powers, to move them to the USA where they would be interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|Two decades later, Phoenix was {{the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>discussions</b> about the city budget. In the late 1970s, the fireboat's annual {{operating}} expenses were about $1.2million. Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished, replaced, or scrapped with no replacement. An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 {{to build a new}} fireboat. Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix, but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond. Instead, Mayor Dianne Feinstein redirected the funds to refurbish Phoenix in 1981–1982.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the needs and merits of a stage <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> between {{national}} government and local government as a political system which is possible to reflect the local governments' will to the national administration. The main theme of study of local governments' participation in the process of national government's political decision, which started from the latter half of the 1970 's, were its theoretical basis, needs and meaning. In 2011, the law on the stage <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> between national government and local government was enacted and the stage <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> was established. This paper states the relationship between the study of local governments' participation in the process of national government's political decision and the stage <b>of</b> <b>discussion,</b> and the needs of the stage according to the process of enactment of the law.

5|$|In early 1997, Paramount's Carowinds began {{consultations}} with roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard about {{adding a new}} ride to their park. During 18 months <b>of</b> <b>discussions,</b> several designs and themes for the ride were developed, including theming it to the Godzilla franchise. In July 1998, the park announced the addition of Top Gun: The Jet Coaster for the 1999 season. At a cost of $10.5 million, {{it would be the}} single biggest investment in the park's history. The announcement followed Paramount Parks adding Top Gun-themed inverted and suspended roller coasters to several of their parks throughout the 1990s, including Paramount's Great America, Paramount Canada's Wonderland, and Paramount's Kings Island. To construct the attraction at Carowinds, the park's Bayern Kurve ride, Wild Bull, had to be removed. The park intended to keep the ride in storage for a potential relocation elsewhere within the park. The removal of Wild Bull shortened construction time because no trees or buildings had to be removed. Construction began in late July 1998, with the first track arriving in August. Testing was completed in January 1999.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{month after}} the storm, a benefit concert was held in St. John's. The concert raised about $400,000 (2010CAD) toward storm relief in one night. In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient and accounted for just 420 of 600work hours. Following more than a year <b>of</b> <b>discussions,</b> the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous insurance claims, reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course of the recovery phase, several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the Burin Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point. An additional $200,000 had been pledged by donors.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1995 The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to develop an initial theory of social studies teachers' conceptions <b>of</b> classroom <b>discussion.</b> I explored teachers' thinking about characteristics and purposes <b>of</b> classroom <b>discussions,</b> and factors that seem to influence teachers' use <b>of</b> <b>discussion.</b> Six high school social studies teachers participated in this study: three taught in a suburban high school, and three taught in an urban high school. These teachers were purposively selected to permit data collection from a diverse and theoretically interesting sample. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and a think-aloud task, and were analyzed using grounded theory's constant-comparative technique [...] an inductive method of generating hypotheses that are grounded in data. During the analysis of these data, six conceptions <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> emerged. Teachers thought <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> as recitation, teacher-directed conversation, open-ended conversation, a series of challenging questions, guided transfer of knowledge, and as practice at verbal interaction. In addition to these conceptions <b>of</b> <b>discussion,</b> five factors emerged that seemed to influence the teachers' use of their conceptions: student diversity, lesson objectives, age and maturity of students, sense of community in the classroom, and interest level of students. Explanations and excerpts from the data are provided to illustrate each of the conceptions and factors of influence. These hypothetical categories [...] both the conceptions and the influences [...] contribute to previous research on discussion by revealing the complexity of teachers' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>discussion,</b> the influence that students have on the teacher's use <b>of</b> <b>discussion,</b> {{and the importance of}} the teacher as <b>discussion</b> leader. Implications <b>of</b> these findings for teachers, teacher educators, and for researchers who are interested in classroom discussion are also examined...|$|R
