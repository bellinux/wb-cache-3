40|$|An {{important}} {{objective of}} the INTEGRATE project 1 is to build tools that support the efficient execution of post-genomic multi-centric clinical trials in breast cancer, which includes the automatic assessment <b>of</b> the <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> patients for available trials. The population suited to be enrolled in a trial is described by a set <b>of</b> free-text <b>eligibility</b> criteria that are both syntactically and semantically complex. At the same time, the assessment <b>of</b> the <b>eligibility</b> <b>of</b> a patient for a trial requires the (machineprocessable) understanding of the semantics <b>of</b> the <b>eligibility</b> criteria {{in order to further}} evaluate if the patient data available for example in the hospital EHR satisfies these criteria. This paper presents an analysis of the semantics of the clinical trial eligibility criteria based on relevant medical ontologies in the clinical research domain: SNOMED-CT, LOINC, MedDRA. We detect subsets of these widely-adopted ontologies that characterize the semantics <b>of</b> the <b>eligibility</b> criteria <b>of</b> trials in various clinical domains and compare these sets. Next, we evaluate the occurrence frequency of the concepts in the concrete case of breast cancer (which is our first application domain) in order to provide meaningful priorities for the task of binding/mapping these ontology concepts to the actual patient data. We further assess the effort required to extend our approach to new domains in terms of additional semantic mappings that need to be developed...|$|R

5|$|Because Bure {{had been}} {{inactive}} since the 2002–03 season, he was eligible for selection into the Hockey Hall of Fame (which requires players to wait {{three years after}} their last game) immediately following his retirement.

5|$|In {{his first}} year <b>of</b> <b>eligibility</b> in , Koufax {{was elected to the}} Baseball Hall of Fame, just weeks after his 36th birthday. His {{election}} made him the Hall's youngest member ever elected, five months younger than Lou Gehrig upon his election in 1939, though because the 1972 induction ceremony was nearly eight months after the election, Koufax's age at induction was slightly higher than Gehrig's, making Gehrig the youngest player ever inducted. On June 4 of that same year, Koufax's uniform number 32 was retired alongside those of Dodger greats Roy Campanella (39) and Jackie Robinson (42).|$|E
