40|$|Adolescents’ Perception <b>of</b> Parental <b>Involvement</b> Scale (APPIS) and Achievement Goal Questionnaire (AGQ) were {{administrated}} to {{a sample}} (N = 300) of Egyptian {{high school students to}} investigate the effect of students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> on their achievement motivation. Parental involvement was investigated as a multidimensional concept that covers home, school, and community according to three main concepts in Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. These concepts are phenomenology, microsystem, and mesosystem. Achievement motivation was investigated as a tripartite construct that includes performanceapproach goal, mastery goal, and performance-avoidance goal according to Elliot's approach and avoidance achievement motivation model. Students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> was found to differ significantly by the type <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> and parents' educational level. There was a significant univariate interaction effect between the type <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> and parents' educational level on students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at school, while there were non-significant univariate interaction effects on students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at home and within community respectively. Students' achievement motivation was found to differ significantly by students' gender and grade. There was a significant univariate interaction effect between students' gender and grade on students' performance-avoidance goal, while there were non-significant univariate interaction effects on students' performanceapproach goal, and mastery goal respectively. Students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> was found to differ significantly by students' gender and grade. There were significant univariate interaction effects between students' gender and grade on students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at home, and within community respectively, while there was a non-significant univariate interaction effect on students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at school. Students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at home has a statistically significant relationship with students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at school, within the community, and mastery goal, while it has a statistically non-significant relationship with performance-approach goal, and performance-avoidance goal. Students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> at school has a statistically significant relationship with students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> within the community,and mastery goal, while it has a statistically non-significant relationship with performance-approach goal, and performance-avoidance goal. Students' perception <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> within the community has a statistically non-significant relationship with students' performance-approach goal, mastery goal, and performance-avoidance goal.

40|$|Parental {{involvement}} {{is defined as}} any parenting practices that promote a child’s development and education. In particular, parental {{involvement is}} associated {{with a wide range of}} positive child outcomes. Much of the existing research on parental involvement, however, has focused on its influence on primary or high school students within western culture, which has limited our understanding of the nature <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> and its implications in the Early Childhood Education (ECE) of Hong Kong schools. This article further defines the concept <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement,</b> reviews different parental involvement models, and discusses the influence <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> on child outcomes. It also introduces the influencing factors <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> in addition to the pros and cons <b>of</b> different parental <b>involvement</b> assessments. Finally, it ends with a discussion <b>of</b> current parental <b>involvement</b> trends in Hong Kong and suggestions for future research and the practice <b>of</b> parental <b>involvement</b> in ECE. 家長參與是指家長參加子女教育活動的過程和現象。研究指出，家長參與可以積極促進兒童發展。然而，這些研究大都局限於西方文化背景並集中在中小學年齡階段，因而缺乏對了解香港家長參與早期教育的情況的作用。本文為家長參與作出定義，分析了不同的家長參與模型，並討論其對兒童發展的影響。本文亦探討了影響家長參與的各項因素和現有家長參與評估的優缺點。最後討論了香港家長參與的現況和對香港家長參與實踐和研究的啟示和建議。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
