In the incident in January 2000, Captain Eduard Ulman's unit killed a civilian and subsequently extrajudicially executed five more with silenced weapons; the commandos then burned the bodies in the victims' vehicle. They were found not guilty in a retrial on May 19, 2005. Although the four admitted the killings, {{the court ruled that}} their actions were not punishable as they had been following <b>orders.</b> The <b>acquittals</b> <b>of</b> Cpt. Ulman and his three subordinates sparked a public outrage in Chechnya, where rights advocates and many Chechens say Russian forces act with impunity. During the third court hearing Ulman and the two officers mysteriously disappeared.http://www.newizv.ru/news/2007-04-13/67868/http://www.gazeta.ru/2007/04/12/oa_236492.shtml ...|$|R

He also accused the agency of running a [...] "death pool," [...] betting on the dates on which inmates would be executed, and asked that the agency be removed from his case. An investigation concluded that these allegations were unfounded.

A member of the Al-Badar militia during the liberation war, Molla was convicted of killing 344 civilians and other crimes. He {{was sentenced to life}} in prison. As {{a direct result of the}} sentence the 2013 Shahbag protests began with the protesters demanding capital punishment for all those on trial. The protest spread from Dhaka to other parts of the country. Protesters called for those convicted of war crimes to be sentenced to capital punishment, and also to ban Jamaat-e-Islami. Jamaat-e-Islami started a violent counter-protest in the country, demanding the release of its convicted and accused leaders.On 17 September 2013, after an amendment to the ICT law which allowed the government, complainant, or informant to appeal an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>acquittal</b> or order of sentencing, the Bangladesh Supreme Court found Molla guilty of murders and other war crimes, and converted his life sentence to a death sentence. He was scheduled to be executed by hanging on 11 December. Due to more legal challenges, the execution was suspended and then upheld; he was executed on 12 December. He was the first person to have been executed for crimes committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E

40|$|In {{what has}} been {{described}} in the media {{as one of the}} most sensational and unusual years in Queensland's legal history, the 2003 criminal trial of Pauline Hanson, former MP and founder of the political party Pauline Hanson's One Nation was the most sensational event of them all. Pauline Hanson and her co-accused David Ettridge were convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment on fraud charges under the Criminal Code (Qld) (the Code), relating to their part in the registration of the political party. What particularly characterised this event was not so much the trial itself, which was relatively uneventful considering the identity of the accused, but the extensive public debate and media coverage following their conviction and imprisonment on 20 August 2003. Pending the hearing of their appeal, unsuccessful applications for bail were taken as far as the High Court. Ultimately, on 6 November 2003, the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed all the convictions and <b>ordered</b> that verdicts <b>of</b> <b>acquittal</b> be entered. Much media analysis has followed, but little discussion of the charges, sentence and appeal process. This article analyses what occurred, and asks the question: Is there really any explaining to do, or were the eventual <b>acquittals</b> an example <b>of</b> due process in accordance with the rule of law? The article also examines the impact of the extraordinary media coverage of the case...|$|R

Once again, the weapon of satyagraha found popular acceptance as the best means to wage a crusade against the British. It was widely used as a mark of protest against the unwavering stance assumed by the British. Vinoba Bhave, a follower of Gandhi, was selected by him to initiate the movement. Anti war speeches ricocheted in all corners of the country, with the satyagrahis earnestly appealing {{to the people of the}} nation not to support the Government in its war endeavors. The consequence of this satyagrahi campaign was the arrest of almost fourteen thousand satyagrahis. On 3 December 1941, the Viceroy <b>ordered</b> the <b>acquittal</b> <b>of</b> all the satyagrahis. In Europe the war situation became more critical with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Congress realised the necessity for appraising their program.
