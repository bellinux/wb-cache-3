40|$|Abstract Multi-component {{reactions}} {{are a very}} elegant and rapid way to access highly functional molecules from simple building blocks in drug lead synthesis. Multi-component <b>one-pot</b> <b>reactions</b> generally afford good yields which is important in combinatorial synthesis. Over the past decade, several sequential multi-component reactions have been developed into multi-component <b>one-pot</b> <b>reactions.</b> Since multi-component <b>one-pot</b> <b>reactions</b> results in a reduced number of operations, they usually allows direct transformation of intermediates to desired products by avoiding isolation, handling and chromatography. Hence, better yields are usually achieved. In this study 1, 4 -disubstituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles were obtained by a high-yielding copper (I) catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reaction between in situ generated azides and terminal acetylenes. This one-pot, two-step procedure tolerated most functional groups and circumvented {{the problems associated with}} the isolation of potentially toxic and explosive organic azides.
