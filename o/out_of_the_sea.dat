5|$|The {{physical}} {{appearance of the}} Sirens is not described in the Odyssey, and the traditional Greek representation of them was as bird-lion or bird-human chimeras. Etty rationalised the fully human appearance of his Sirens by explaining that their forms became fully human once <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> an approach followed {{by a number of}} later painters of the subject.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy force {{took only}} {{ten minutes to}} disable the corvettes. They then began to pull {{survivors}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> but the rescue was suspended at about 22:30, when the TA 20 {{was picked up by}} radar and fired upon. The first salvo hit her bridge killing all officers, and knocking out her fire-control system. She sank close to Pag Island. Neither TA 20, nor the corvettes managed to radio news of the attack.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a turn at a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> 126 crewmen died, {{as well as a}} wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} worsened, Royal Navy destroyers were {{only able to}} rescue 90 survivors from the three German ships. Before the rescue operation was suspended to engage TA 20, Wheatland pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> three officers and 68 seamen—most of them crew of UJ 202. The Kriegsmarine sortied TA 40 and TA 45 corvettes as well as S 33 and S 154 E-boats to look for survivors, finding seventeen TA 20 crew members on the islet of Trstenik on 3 November. The group included seven wounded, tended by a local lighthouse crew. Besides them, the ships rescued one UJ 202 and three UJ 208 crew members from the sea. The deteriorating weather also prevented retrieval of the coast watchers for four days. More than two hundred Germans perished in this action, including the flotilla commander and all three ship commanding officers.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{failed to}} intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally {{was able to}} intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan {{to act as a}} diversion and pull Japanese forces <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Japan and the Yellow Sea. The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, Kyūshū, fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.|$|E

40|$|Methane {{emissions}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> could seriously affect Earthâs {{climate and}} are usually associated with <b>the</b> dissociation <b>of</b> gas hydrates stored in marine sediments on the continental margins. Spatially, gas emissions <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seafloor are not evenly distributed in continental margins. Gas emissions <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> generally occur through submarine mud volcanoes and gas seeps. To understand <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> gas emissions off SW Taiwan, we investigate <b>the</b> distributions <b>of</b> active submarine mud volcanoes, gas seeps, and gas plumes off SW Taiwan. We examine all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> available sub-bottom profiler and EK echo sounder data. We identified 19 submarine mud volcanoes, 220 gas seeps, and 295 gas plumes. The gas emissions are generally distributed at <b>the</b> crests <b>of</b> mud diapiric ridges. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active mud volcanoes and gas seeps cluster at the KASMVG (Kaoping submarine mud volcanoes group) area. We speculate that the intensive mud volcanism and gas seepage at the KASMVG area are ascribed to submarine channel erosion along the continental slope base. The erosion causes a deep V-shaped channel and a steep BSR (Bottom-Simulating Reflector) slope curve across the continental margin. The upward migration rate of free gas beneath the BSR is thus increased and intensifies mud volcanism and gas seepage at the KASMVG area. The gas seeps can reduce the slope stability and generate small-scale slides. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> mud volcanoes in an area could effectively disturb <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> morphology so that large-scale submarine landslides cannot easily happen...|$|R
