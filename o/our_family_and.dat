Hannah Stone earned [...] a modest income through selling eggs and cheese but was denied any control over that money, sometimes denied money to purchase things Francis considered trivial.

As a child, Lucy resented instances of what she saw as her father’s unfair management of the family’s money. But she later came to realize that custom was to blame, and the injustice only demonstrated “the necessity of making custom right, if it must rule.” ...|$|E
