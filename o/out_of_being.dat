5|$|On June 29, 2014, in an {{interview}} to Totalrock radio, Duff McKagan talked to Hayley Leggs in Clisson France about {{the subject of a}} new lead vocalist for Velvet Revolver and revealed that there had been at least one audition for the role of lead vocalist, but said that the person that they auditioned did not properly impress the remaining members of the band. He also ruled himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded, saying that being the lead vocalist and being a bass player at the same time was not as appealing to him because it would require him to be much more static in his stage presence, saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances. In the same interview, McKagan talked about his new book which was then in the writing stages.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood. She devises a plan to trick the owner into selling by having a con artist (supplied by Saul) pretend to be a water-tester who is shutting down the business out of concerns over contaminants. The owner promptly sells to her, agreeing to an even lower price than her original offer. Jesse is still feeling numb from recent events, attempting to clear his head with nostalgic go-kart trips. He continues to open his house up for all-night drug-fueled orgies, deliberately throwing piles of money {{in the midst of the}} chaos. Angry and frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to get her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> charged. The same officer drops by the Schrader residence to seek Hank's help by giving him Gale's lab notes to look at. Hank initially shoves away the notebook, but begins to read it later that night.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

Although she notes her experiences with medication and therapists in the hopes of overcoming her depression, she focuses more substantially on the ordinary things that helped her move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> ‘stuck': swimming, writing, spending time with friends, doing yoga, going to the dentist.|$|E

500|$|... "Clean, Clean" [...] is the album's fifth track, {{and follows}} {{the story of}} a young boy who grows <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a gangster, and, despite not willing to do so, he will at least try to keep the {{fighting}} clean. Wave Maker Magazine found [...] "Elstree," [...] the album's sixth song, as lyrically similar to [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star," [...] as it follows [...] "a failed actor taking up a more regular position behind the scenes and looking back at his life in regret." [...] The slow-tempo ballad [...] "Astroboy (And the Proles on Parade)", according to Wave Maker, [...] "once again revisits cyberpunk with a much lighter vibe, although the keyboards do occasionally border darker realms, expecially with the post-chorus hook," [...] and the album closer [...] "Johnny on the Monorail" [...] has a [...] "pop atmosphere" [...] that [...] "better suits the flow of the rest of the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

2500|$|Janlori Goldman, {{director}} of the advocacy group Health Privacy Project, said that some hospitals are being [...] "overcautious" [...] and misapplying the law, the Times reports. Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., has interpreted a federal regulation that requires hospitals to allow patients to opt <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> included in the hospital directory as meaning that patients want to be {{kept out of the}} directory unless they specifically say otherwise. As a result, if a patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to choose {{to be included in the}} directory, relatives and friends might not be able to find them, Goldman said.|$|E

'We have lost the joy and power that makes real disciples and we've become consumers of religion, not disciples of Jesus-Christ', he said. 'Christians, go and make friends among Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, agnostics, atheists, not {{for the purpose of}} converting them to your beliefs but for friendship, understanding, listening, hearing.' His remarks were greeted with applause, not with silence as the order of the service instructed." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 September, the Board of West Ham confirmed, {{following}} press speculation, {{that they}} were in takeover talks with an unnamed party. They announced that there was no link between this prospective takeover bid and the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano the day before. Media Sports Investment (MSI), the company which owns the contracts of those two players and which chose to bring them to West Ham, confirmed that it had no interest in investing in European football clubs, thereby ruling itself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> behind these talks. However, a consortium headed [...] by former MSI frontman Kia Joorabchian entered into talks with the club on 5 September. These talks broke down in early November after further debts that had not been declared by West Ham were revealed in the due diligence process. This was compounded by the announcement that West Ham would be unable to move into London's Olympic Stadium after the event, which was to be reserved for athletics use.|$|E
2500|$|If {{evidence}} {{were to be}} uncovered {{which showed}} that George Mallory or Andrew Irvine had reached the summit of Everest in 1924, advocates of Hillary and Norgay's first ascent maintain that the historical record should not be changed to state that Mallory and Irvine made the first ascent, displacing Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Former Mount Everest summiteer Major H. P. S. Ahluwalia claims that without photographic proof, {{there is no evidence}} that Mallory reached the summit and [...] "it would be unfair to say that the first man to scale Mount Everest was George Mallory". George Mallory's own son, John Mallory, who was only three years old when his father died, said, [...] "To me the only way you achieve a summit is to come back alive. The job is only half done if you don't get down again". Sir Edmund Hillary's daughter, Sarah, when questioned regarding her father's take on the debate, said, [...] "His view was that he had got 50 good years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> conqueror of Everest, and, whatever happened, he wasn't particularly worried.

2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. It takes all the pressure <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in a recording studio. We {{were able to take}} our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to relate to that situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
2500|$|When I was young, {{literary}} critics often rejoiced that {{the hypocrisy of}} the Victorians had been discredited, or expressed confidence that the operation would soon be complete. So far from that, it has returned in a peculiarly stifling form to take possession of critics of Eng. Lit.; Mr Pecksniff has become {{the patron saint of}} many of my colleagues. As so often, the deformity is the result of severe pressure between forces in themselves good. The study of English authors of the past is now centred in the universities, and yet there must be no censorship - no work of admitted literary merit may be hidden from the learners. Somehow we must save poor Teacher's face, and protect him from the indignant or jeering students, local authorities or parents. It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as much as we do, even, and wanted his book to shame everybody <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> so nasty ever again. This is often called fearless or unflinching criticism, and one of its ill effects is to make the young people regard all literature as a terrific nag or scold. Independently of this, a strong drive has been going on to recover the children for orthodox or traditional religious beliefs; ... and when you understand all that, you may just be able to understand how they manage to present James Joyce as a man devoted to the God who was satisfied by the crucifixion.
