Test specimens made of ABNT 52100 bearing steel, with average hardness of 60 - 61 HRc were machined. The cutting tool material applied was mixed ceramic inserts. Several feed rate, tool diameter and rotational speeds of workpiece and tool were tested. Tests were conducted on a CNC lathe which had a milling head coupled to it. This coupling was made on the transverse carrier, figuring an orthogonal exposure of the rotating axes for workpiece and tool, thus characterizing orthogonal turn-milling. The achieved results showed that work quality and low roughness values can be obtained; however, the technology must be better investigated...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Non-stationary {{analysis}} of the response of long span bridges subjected to random multi support motions {{is presented in the}} study. The proposed methodology is more general than the existing ones {{in the sense that it}} can evaluate non-stationarity in both intensity and frequency content of the response statistics for spatially correlated multi-point random excitations. The other advantage of the proposed wavelet based methodology is that it can be easily used to predict the stochastic response of any structural systems in conjunction with available finite element software. The input-output formulation is also not restrictive to a particular wavelet basis function. The bridge has been modelled with multi-spans in a finite element framework. Using a modified form of the Littlewood-Paley (real part of Harmonic) wavelet basis function, the support motions has been modelled as a summation of independent random processes in different non-overlapping frequency bands. At each frequency band, the random process is expressed as a product of a stationary <b>orthogonal</b> <b>process</b> and a scale dependent deterministic envelope function. An exponential coherence function is also used to model the spatial variation of the ground motion. The results demonstrate the importance of frequency non-stationarity on the response of a multi-span bridge. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The <b>orthogonal</b> <b>processes</b> {{to shape}} the {{triangle}} steel plate into a equilateral vertical steel are examined by an incremental elasto-plastic finite-element method based on an updated Lagrangian formulation. The highly non-linear problems due to the geometric changes, the inelastic constitutive behavior and the boundary conditions varied with deformation {{are taken into account}} in an incremental manner. On the contact boundary, a modified Coulomb friction mode is specially considered. A weighting factor r-minimum is employed to limit the step size of loading increment to linear relation. In particular, selective reduced integration was adopted to formulate the stiffness matrix. The simulated geometries of verticality could clearly demonstrate the vertical processes until unloading. A series of experiments and simulations were performed to validate the formulation in the theory, leading {{to the development of the}} computer codes. The whole deformation history and the distribution of stress, strain and thickness during the forming process were obtained by carefully considering the moving boundary condition in the finite-element method. Therefore, this modeling can be used for judging whether a equilateral vertical steel can be shaped successfully. The present work may be expected to improve the understanding of the formation of the equilateral vertical steel.

40|$|Eigen values {{evaluation}} {{is an integral}} but computation-intensive part for many image and signal processing applications. Modified Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (MGSO) is an efficient method for evaluating the Eigen values in face recognition algorithms. MGSO applies normalization of vectors in its iterative <b>orthogonal</b> <b>process</b> and its accuracy depends on the accuracy of normalization. Using software, floatingpoint data types and floating-point operations are applied to minimize rounding and truncation effects. Hardware support for floating-point operations may be very costly in execution time per operation and also may increase power consumption. In contrast, lower-cost fixed-point arithmetic reduces execution times and lowers the power consumption but reduces slightly the precision. Normalization involves square root operations {{in addition to other}} arithmetic operations. Hardware realization of the floating-point square root operation may be prohibitively expensive because of its complexity. This paper presents three architectures, namely ppc 405, ppc_ip and pc_pci, that employ fixed-point hardware for the efficient implementation of normalization on an FPGA. We evaluate the suitability of these architectures based on the needed frequency of normalization. The proposed architectures produce a less than 10 - 3 error rate compared with their software-driven counterpart for implementing floating-point operations. Furthermore, four popular databases of faces are used to benchmark the proposed architectures. ...|$|E
40|$|Modelling of {{the cutting}} forces in micromilling is {{challenging}} {{due to the}} size effect and existence of a minimum chip thickness. This paper presents {{the development of a}} cutting force model for micromilling of brass. The prediction of cutting forces derives from a simplified <b>orthogonal</b> <b>process.</b> A finite element (FE) model is employed to simulate two-dimensional cutting forces in orthogonal microcutting, with the ploughing and tool edge effect taken into consideration. The flow stress of workpiece material is modelled by using the Johnson–Cook constitutive material law. The FE model is used to evaluate the critical chip thickness and to extract the cutting force coefficients. The cutting force coefficients are modelled as a function of instantaneous uncut chip thickness, which is independent of cutting speed but influenced by tool edge radius. To rectify the issue of sharp increase of the force coefficients under very small uncut chip thickness, a critical uncut chip thickness value is introduced and the coefficients are adjusted by using a tangent slope for uncut chip thickness smaller than the critical value. A generalized analytical force model based on numerical findings is developed to predict the micromilling force by considering the tool trajectory and tool runout. The simulation results of micromilling forces are compared against experimental measurement, where an agreement of force trends is shown along with the increasing feedrate and depth of cut.

40|$|International audienceThe common {{external}} {{cylindrical gears}} are manufactured by gear hobbing process. The particularity {{of this operation}} {{is due to the}} nature of the interaction between the tool cutting edge and the workpiece material which is more complex than in conventional machining operations such as turning, milling or drilling. This can affect significantly the thermomechanical process of the chip formation. The main goal of this paper is to propose a coupled approach to analyze accurately the cutting edge effect and to predict the evolution of cutting forces during the finishing hobbing process. This model is based on two parts: (i) during the hobbing operation, the evolution of the undeformed chip section generated by each hob's tooth is determined from the CAD geometrical simulations and (ii) the cutting forces are calculated from a mechanistic model. In this mechanistic approach, the specific force coefficients (cutting and edge effects) have been determined from a thermomechanical model, based on the ALE (Arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian) approach, by considering the material characteristics such as strain rate sensitivity, strain hardening and thermal softening. It can be noted that the ALE approach allows to accurately take into account accurately the cutting edge effect and to analyze the triboligical conditions at the tool-chip interface (i. e. the contact nature: sliding, sticking or sticking-sliding contact). Indeed, this kind of information is of great importance to analyze the effect of cutting condition on the tool wear. The numerical and experimental results are compared for several cutting velocities in <b>orthogonal</b> <b>process.</b> The present approach leads to a three dimensional cutting force model for hobbing process and appears as an interesting alternative to the classical mechanistic approach which requires many experimental tests to determine the cutting force coefficients. Finally, the proposed model has been applied to analyze a finishing hobbing gear with very large sizes (several meters) ...|$|E
40|$|Micro milling {{operation}} {{is one of}} the advanced machining processes to manufacture miniature parts in biomedical, optics and electronics industries. The chip thickness in micro milling is comparable to the tool edge radius, which brings strong size effect to the cutting performance and makes prediction of the cutting forces more challenging. In this thesis, an analysis of the micro milling process has been carried out based on an experimental study to cut different materials using micro flat end mills on a precision CNC machine tool. Influences of cutting parameters on cutting forces and machined surface quality have been evaluated. A cutting force model has been developed by determine the key coefficients from finite element method, with a simulation study and model verification presented. It has been found that cutting forces occurred at low feed per tooth are relatively high by assessing the averaged peak forces from the experiments. When feed per tooth is relatively close to tool edge radius, the forces were not growing in linearity with the increasing feedrate. This finding indicates the significance of ploughing phenomenon as an effect of tool edge radius in micro milling. Also, machining at high spindle speed may contribute to process instability and significant peak force variation, and have negative effect on work surface quality. Moreover, the workpiece machined by 0. 9 mm diameter tool achieved better surface quality than those done by 0. 6 mm tool. It is shown that reducing depth of cut can reduce burr formation. In addition, the width of deformed chips has been measured considerably close to the depth of cut value. To investigate the size effect on cutting performance, the prediction of cutting forces derives from a simplified <b>orthogonal</b> <b>process.</b> A finite element model is developed to simulate two-dimensional cutting forces in orthogonal micro cutting of brass, which has addressed the ploughing and tool edge effects.

Within a small interconnected reaction network, <b>orthogonal</b> recognition <b>processes</b> drive the assembly and replication of a [2]rotaxane. Rotaxane formation is governed by a central, hydrogen bonding-mediated binding equilibrium between a macrocycle and a linear component, which associate to give a reactive pseudorotaxane.

40|$|AbstractThe {{substitution}} of wet machining processes by dry processes {{is an important}} development in manufacturing technology. A central challenge is the significant higher heating and thus the resulting thermal expansion of the workpiece which leads to geometrical deviations of the machined part. According {{to the state of}} the art these processes are optimized by trial and error approaches and therefore result in high costs. This paper presents a two-scale finite element model which calculates the thermal deformation of the workpiece in dry turning of normalized steel C 45 E / AISI 1045. The approach consists of two submodels. The first submodel is a fully coupled finite element chip formation model for the calculation of the generated heat and temperature distribution in the chip, workpiece and tool. On this basis the rate of heat flow into the workpiece is determined. In a second model this rate of heat flow is applied to a macroscale model that calculates the instationary temperature distribution and deformation of the whole workpiece. The chip formation model has been validated by an <b>orthogonal</b> cutting <b>process</b> realized on a broaching machine tool while the workpiece model is validated by thermal imaging of an <b>orthogonal</b> turning <b>process...</b>|$|R

We analyze by means of principal component analysis the genomic correlation of several mouse subspecies and discriminate between two distinct and mutually <b>orthogonal</b> <b>processes</b> of genetic differentiation which can be equated to interspecific and intersubspecific divergence. While the first principal component is responsible for the separation of different species, the second and third principal component discriminates between different strains within the same species. We find that the across genome correlation distance is both robust and highly different between the two components, and displays a scale invariant distribution. We also report a scale invariant, heterogeneous (non-stochastic) 7 ray clusters of the system variation that may be equated to the biological process. These findings suggest that the correlation structure of millions of genetic elements along the genome is highly important during the process of evolution and may indicate of strong constraints. Moreover, based on our results, we postulate that the observed genetic robustness can distinguish between micro- and macro-evolution, a phenomenology that was predicted by the punctuated equilibrium model and gain more profound view for the role of complex interacting networks on genome evolution...|$|R

One underappreciated {{reason for this}} trend is that the field lacks a general-purpose framework targeted {{to the study of}} behavior. This chapter presents one such framework, a metatheory called the I 3 Model (pronounced “I-cubed model”), which suggests that all behavior emerges from a combination of three <b>orthogonal</b> <b>processes.</b> Instigation encompasses the effects of exposure to a particular target object in a particular context that normatively affords a certain behavior.

Inhibition encompasses the effects of situational or stable factors that increase the likelihood that (or the extent to which) people will override the effects of instigation and impellance on behavior, thereby reducing its enactment. According to “Perfect Storm Theory, ” which is derived from the I 3 Model, the highest likelihood or intensity of behavior emerges when instigation and impellance are strong and inhibition is weak.
