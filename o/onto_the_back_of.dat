5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|On lap 40, Ericsson {{started to}} slow on track and {{eventually}} retired. One lap later, Hamilton moved into second ahead of Ricciardo {{on the main}} straight. Lap 42 saw first Sainz and then Verstappen overtake Palmer's Renault, who fell back to eleventh. Another lap later, Ricciardo changed tyres and came out fifth behind Massa, taking fourth three laps later. At the front, Hamilton and Vettel slowly closed on Rosberg, with {{the gap between the}} two also coming down. Vettel came <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton with five laps remaining, chasing him closely for several laps before making a mistake in the second to last corner of lap 55, losing his chances at second place.|$|E

5|$|Stela 31 is the {{accession}} monument of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, also bearing two {{portraits of}} his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, {{as a youth}} dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. He carries a spearthrower {{in one hand and}} bears a shield decorated with the face of Tlaloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.|$|E
25|$|After the President {{had been}} shot in the head, Mrs. Kennedy began to climb out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the limousine, though she later had no {{recollection}} of doing so. Hill believed she was reaching for something, perhaps a piece of the President's skull. He jumped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the limousine while at the same time Mrs. Kennedy returned to her seat, and he clung to the car as it exited Dealey Plaza and accelerated, speeding to Parkland Memorial Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of the desert locust {{consists}} of three stages, the egg, the nymph known as a hopper, and the winged adult. Copulation takes place when a mature male hops <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a mature female and grips her body with his legs. Sperm is transferred {{from the tip of}} his abdomen to the tip of hers, where it is stored. The process takes several hours and one insemination is sufficient for a number of batches of eggs.|$|E

This combination was never named, as {{it is not really}} part of the actual series.|$|R
5000|$|Soviet propagandists {{claimed the}} {{original}} Erna team {{participated in the}} mass murder of Soviet political activists. Sometimes, the myths also claim that the letter 'E' was cut <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims. These claims were reinvigorated in the 1980s {{as a way of}} distracting historians analysing the Kautla massacre, and have been repeated in Russian media in 2000s. Russian authorities regard the commemorative Erna Raid as [...] "heroizing fascism".|$|R

The video, shot in greyscale, shows {{each of the}} group members alone in an empty room with their hands covering their face, and an image of their face projected <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> their hands. MuchMusic blogger Liam Scott described the visual effects in the video as [...] "pretty nifty (if slightly creepy)," [...] which helped deliver the titular chills.|$|R
25|$|In {{this case}} the sine waves {{generated}} by the ANS are printed onto five glass discs using a process that Murzin (an optical engineer) had to develop himself. Each disc has 144 individual tracks printed onto it, {{for a total of}} 720 microtones (discrete pitches), spanning 10 octaves. This yields a resolution of 1/72 octave (16.67 cents). The modulated light from these wheels is then projected <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the synthesizer's interface. These are arranged in a continuous swath vertically, with low frequencies at the bottom and high frequencies at the top.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{assassination}} spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, {{an agent}} protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was {{riding in the}} car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car he was riding on and jumped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Though {{capable of}} sprinting, the cougar is {{typically}} an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar {{is capable of}} breaking the neck {{of some of its}} smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. The head of the cat is round and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a dewclaw) and four on its hind paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.|$|E
5000|$|Alain Bernardin {{opened it}} in 1951 and {{personally}} operated it for decades {{until his death}} by suicide in 1994. Many of the original waiters (their names stitched in large letters <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> their waistcoats) were also substantial shareholders in the original company. The enterprise remained a family business, {{in the hands of}} Bernardin's three children, until 2005, when it changed hands.

5000|$|The term [...] "horse {{artillery}}" [...] {{refers to}} the faster moving artillery batteries that typically supported cavalry regiments. The term [...] "flying artillery" [...] is sometimes used as well. In such batteries, the artillerymen were all mounted, in contrast to batteries in which the artillerymen walked alongside their guns (although regular artillerymen would sometimes jump <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> their team when rapid battlefield movement was required, and they typically rode upon the limbers, caissons or supply wagons while on a march). A prominent organization of such artillery in the Union Army was the U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade.|$|R
25|$|Voldemort {{makes his}} debut in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. In this story, Rowling {{introduces}} {{him as the}} Dark Lord who murdered Harry's parents, James and Lily, {{but as a result}} of his mother's love and willingness to sacrifice herself for him, baby Harry survives when Voldemort tries to murder him with a Killing Curse. Voldemort is disembodied, and Harry carries a mysterious scar on his forehead as a result. In the book, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to regain his dissolved body by stealing the titular Philosopher's Stone. To achieve his objective, Voldemort uses Professor Quirrell's aid by latching <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Quirrell's head. However, at the climax of the book, Harry manages to prevent Voldemort from stealing the stone.|$|E
25|$|The building's {{original}} {{elevator shaft}} {{was determined to}} be too small for a modern elevator, so a new shaft was built <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the building along with a new stairwell. As part of the restoration requirements, the exterior of the shaft had to be a different color than the building to easily distinguish it from the original structure. Its placement on the building's southwest corner was done under guidelines from the National Park Service. The original elevator shaft was used as a conduit for electrical wiring and plumbing. Additionally, one of the original entrance doors facing East Main Street had to be restored but unusable due to a ramp for the building to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Edge faced Booker T. Booker T gained the {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the match. However, Edge recovered by countering Booker's top rope attack with a hurricanrana and followed this up with a spinning heel kick off the top rope. Booker T executed a Scissors Kick, for a near-fall while Edge delivered a spear for a near fall. After performing his own version of Booker's Spinaroonie, Edge won the match with an Edgecution. Backstage, a cautious Hurricane was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman about winning the Hardcore Championship. The Hurricane's sidekick, Mighty Molly, appeared and suggested the two should go to their Hurri-Cycle. Just as Hurricane headed to that direction, Molly smashed a frying pan <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his head and pinned him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|E

50|$|The {{existence}} of immune privilege in the testes of rodents is well accepted, due to many experiments demonstrating prolonged, and sometimes indefinite, survival of tissue transplanted into the testis, or testicular tissue transplanted elsewhere. Evidence includes the tolerance of testicular grafts in mice and rats, {{as well as}} the increased survival of transplants of pancreatic insulin-producing cells in rats, when cells from the testes (Sertoli cells) are added to the transplanted material. Complete spermatogenesis, forming functional pig or goat sperm, can be established by the grafting of pig or goat testicular tissue <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> mice - however, immunodeficient mice needed to be used.|$|R

25|$|Another {{technique}} {{that was used}} in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the translucent screen. The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman, who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the Tyrannosaurus fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a Stegosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside {{the trunk of the}} Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the safety}} car, Jensen, Kanamaru, Sekiguichi and Chang chose to make pit stops for repairs to their cars.

Giovinazzi slid going into Lisboa corner but regained control of his car. Zhi become another retiree as he crashed at Police turn after the restart. Sims passed Sette Câmara and then MacLeod driving towards Lisboa turn to claim fourth place on the fourth lap and began to focus himself on reducing the time deficit to the leading trio of cars by setting consecutive fastest laps of the qualifying race. At the front of the race, Giovinazzi extended his lead to one and a half seconds and this allowed him to break clear from Rosenqvist. Ferrucci passed Maini and Lorandi to settle for seventh by the conclusion of the event. Giovinazzi was struggling for grip, and Rosenqvist narrowed his lead {{at the front of the}} race to eight-tenths of a second by the start of the final lap, and slipstreamed up behind Giovinazzi driving towards Lisboa corner.|$|E

She later attempts to greet him but is pulled away by fans and photographers. The content of the telegram is then revealed to be a message of her father's death, and as Aguilera realizes that she was too wrapped up in her stardom to deal with what matters, she races through the circus in a belated attempt to find her father. Overwhelmed, Aguilera collapses on the ground and then sees a shadow figure of a man {{standing in front of the}} circus tent. Hoping the shadow figure to be her father, Aguilera holds out her hand with the elephant necklace on it in an attempt of reconciliation. She break down crying when she realizes the silhouette has disappeared and that her father is truly gone.

As Van Der Zande crossed the start/finish line to continue racing, he attempted {{to find his way}} past Kennard. Van Der Zande was unable to get past and ended up drifting into the wall at Lisboa turn while Kennard resumed without trouble. Ho then made a pit stop and retired shortly after. On the fifth lap, Jarvis made his overtaking manoevure on Asmer for the lead by slipstreaming <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> him heading down the main straight and passed the driver around the outside at Lisboa corner. At the same time, Senna managed to find his way past Hülkenberg and started to close the gap to Buurmann. Hülkenberg then tried to line up a passing move on Senna to reclaim the position but lost control of his car and glanced the barriers lining the track at Lisboa corner. Both he and Senna were forced into retirement. Localised yellow flags were waved which neutralised racing in that section of the circuit because of debris scattered across the tarmac surface.|$|E

Further down the field, Cassidy got ahead of Merhi to move into fifth. Blomqvist resisted an overtaking manoevure from Ocon to keep third position, while Latifi retook seventh from King and Coletti lost ninth to Serrallés. Rosenqvist quickly built up a {{one and a half}} second lead over teammate Auer who was able to reduce the gap to nine-tenths of a second, but Rosenqvist maintained the lead {{for the rest of the}} qualifying race to win and claim the pole position for the Grand Prix itself. Blomqvist fended off further attacks from Ocon to clinch third with Cassidy fifth and Merhi sixth. Behind the trio, Latifi followed in seventh with King eighth and Serrallés ninth. Coletti rounded out the top ten finishers. Outside the top ten, Fuoco took eleventh ahead of Ferrucci, with the Japanese duo of Kanamaru, Yamashita in the next two places. Menezes, Calderón, Cao, Goddard, Pommer, Takaboshi, Chang and Wells rounded out the classified finishers. Buller finished but was not classified as he was two laps behind the winner.|$|E
