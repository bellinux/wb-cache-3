5|$|Spitzer devoted much of {{his career}} to pushing for the {{development}} of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.|$|E

25|$|In {{the hope}} that its {{involvement}} would bring about greater public interest in the future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> von Braun also began working with Walt Disney and the Disney studios as a technical director, initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was Man in Space, which first went on air on March 9, 1955, drawing 40 million viewers.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Lind {{expressed}} interest in being assigned to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the final mission of the Apollo program; ultimately, Brand was assigned as Command Module Pilot alongside senior managers Slayton (who assigned himself to the mission as Docking Module Pilot after being medically grounded for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program)</b> and Commander Thomas P.

While there Doug Flutie led Hoover Junior High School's football team to two Brevard County Championships. After the dramatic slow-down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program</b> in the mid-1970s, the Flutie family again moved in 1976 to Natick, Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Boeing {{suffered}} from the simultaneous decline in Vietnam War military spending, the slowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program</b> as Project Apollo neared completion, the recession of 1969–70, and the company's $2billion debt as it built the new 747 airliner. Boeing did not receive any orders {{for more than a}} year. Its bet for the future, the 747, was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its Pratt & Whitney engines. Another problem was that, in 1971, the U.S. Congress decided to stop funding {{for the development of the}} supersonic 2707, Boeing's answer to the British-French Concorde, forcing the company to discontinue the project.|$|E
500|$|In November 1960, John F. Kennedy {{was elected}} {{president}} after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union {{in the fields of}} space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the [...] "missile gap" [...] that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not [...] "first but, first and, first if, but first period." [...] Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> astronauts and reporters would often socialize {{together}} in Cocoa Beach, and had a very different relationship than they do today. Barbree described {{his relationship with the}} astronauts as a friend and confidant, often going out to dinner with them, or socializing together when the astronauts were in town. In his book, Barbree writes that in 1961 Alan Shepard told him an [...] "off the record" [...] fact: He {{was going to be the}} first American astronaut in space. Barbree noted that if he were to report this, it would not only jeopardize the friendships, but possibly his career as well, so he said nothing. Barbree also recounts a conversation with Gus Grissom about the astronaut’s concerns regarding Apollo not long before the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Barbree's association with the astronauts had some unexpected bonuses as well, Neil Armstrong carried a gold coin to the moon on Apollo 11 for Barbree, and Pete Conrad flew several flags and patches on Apollo 12, which Barbree later handed out to friends.|$|E

2500|$|The {{election}} of President John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts in 1960 was a partial reflection of this shift. In the campaign, Kennedy attracted {{a new generation}} of younger voters.
