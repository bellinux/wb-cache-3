5|$|Of {{far greater}} {{importance}} to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative {{effect that the}} extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> were also frequently unfavorable.|$|E
5|$|In addition, it {{was often}} claimed that the Party did not allow any member to resign, so {{a person who had}} been a member for a short time decades {{previously}} could be considered as suspect as a current member. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> and trials of McCarthyism featured testimony by former Communist Party members such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, and Whittaker Chambers, speaking as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{inconclusive}} nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> {{helped to}} foster continued speculation {{as to the}} nature of the mystery, and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy. Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo, submarine earthquakes (seaquakes), waterspouts, attacks by giant squid, and paranormal intervention.|$|E

5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at <b>the</b> <b>hearings.</b> As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two to one decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearing's</b> three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel {{found that he was}} loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.|$|R
5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the confirmation of charges hearings were announced on 23 January 2012. Despite the ICC regulations requiring the Pre-Trial Chamber to normally issue a verdict on confirmation of charges within sixty days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> taking place the chamber issued a ruling on 26 October 2011 to vary this time limit to allow both the results in both cases to be announced simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings,</b> becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after being threatened, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in one of his first cases. In another of his early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E

5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment on <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> holding <b>the</b> confirmation <b>of</b> charges <b>hearings</b> in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> holding <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> in Arusha, Tanzania, which is <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited {{the possibility that a}} change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> will take place at <b>the</b> seat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court in The Hague.|$|R
5|$|McCarthy's {{committee}} {{then began}} {{an investigation into}} the United States Army. This began at the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but ultimately nothing came of this investigation. McCarthy next {{turned his attention to the}} case of a U.S. Army dentist who had been promoted to the rank of major despite having refused to answer questions on an Army loyalty review form. McCarthy's handling of this investigation, including a series of insults directed at a brigadier general, led to the Army-McCarthy hearings, with the Army and McCarthy trading charges and counter-charges for 36 days before a nationwide television audience. While the official outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> was inconclusive, this exposure of McCarthy to the American public resulted in a sharp decline in his popularity. In less than a year, McCarthy was censured by the Senate and his position as a prominent force in anti-communism was essentially ended.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{findings}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> blamed Cohn rather than McCarthy, they are widely considered {{an important element}} of McCarthy's disgrace. After the Army–McCarthy hearings, Cohn resigned from McCarthy's staff and went into private practice.|$|E
25|$|The Senate {{decided that}} these {{conflicting}} charges {{should be investigated}} and the appropriate committee to do this was the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy. Since McCarthy {{was one of the}} targets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings,</b> Senator Karl Mundt (R-South Dakota) was reluctantly appointed to replace McCarthy as chairman of the subcommittee. John G. Adams was the Army's Counsel. Acting as Special Counsel was Joseph Welch of the Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr (now called WilmerHale). The hearings were broadcast nationally on the new ABC and DuMont networks, and in part by NBC. Francis Newton Littlejohn, the news director at ABC, made the decision to cover the hearings live, gavel-to-gavel. The televised hearings lasted for 36 days and an estimated 80 million people saw at least part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings.</b>|$|E

25|$|Russell was {{a highly}} {{respected}} senatorial colleague and skilled legislator. Russell chaired the Senate investigation into the firing of General Douglas MacArthur. Conducted during a political firestorm over the firing, Russell's chairmanship prevented national rancor and layered political motivations surrounding the firing from interfering in a dignified and insightful investigation into the incident. Military historians have printed transcripts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> to instruct on the proper relationship between civilian and military officials in a democracy.|$|E
25|$|Discovery Institute fellows {{used the}} media {{coverage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> to take their message to the public. The Institute's vice president and program director, Stephen C. Meyer, appeared on the Fox News show The Big Story with John Gibson, where he debated Eugenie Scott, {{executive director of the}} National Center for Science Education. There Meyer sought to convey the Institute's message that debate over evolution is not a ploy to get religious ideas into public schools, that evolution is a theory in crisis, and that students were currently being taught in error there was no scientific controversy over evolution.|$|E
50|$|However, {{thanks to}} popular {{pressure}} <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> trial, <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> were adjourned once again. That did not please, resident-general, François Manceron, who succeeded in starting an argument between the journalists and Khairallah, over <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newspaper, which {{ended up with}} their resignation from the journal.|$|R

25|$|In 1953, Hughes was {{involved}} with a high profile lawsuit {{as part of the}} settlement of the United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Antitrust Case. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings,</b> the shaky status of RKO became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders had grown to be extremely annoying to Hughes. They had accused him with financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement. Since Hughes wanted to focus primarily on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the Korean War years, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, the Kansas {{school board}} held the Kansas {{evolution}} hearings. The court-style hearings were {{promoted by the}} Discovery Institute and attended by its Fellows and other intelligent design advocates but not by mainstream scientists, who accused it of being a kangaroo court. The result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings</b> was the adoption by the Republican-dominated board of new science standards that relied upon the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan employing the institute's Teach the Controversy approach, despite these having been rejected by the State Board Science Hearing Committee. With the 2006 ouster {{of the majority of}} the conservative board members, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum that removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{between the}} labour unions {{and the group}} {{management}} have been testy at times, particularly {{after a series of}} wage cuts, retrenchments, and early retirement affected staff morale during and after difficult economic conditions such as the SARS outbreak in 2003. The ALPA-S alone has been involved in no less than 24 disputes with group management since its registration in May 1981 (itself formed after its predecessor, the Singapore Airlines Pilots Association had 15 EXCO members charged and convicted for initiating illegal industrial action in 1980 in the wake of disputes with management and the SIAPA was deregistered on 26 February 1981) up to 30 November 2003, when the Ministry of Manpower (Singapore) amended the Trade Unions Act to overrule an item in ALPA-S's constitution requiring formal ratification from the general membership for negotiation agreements involving the executive committee. In 2007, the airline was in the spotlight again when ALPA-S disagreed with the management's proposed salary rate for pilots flying the Airbus A380, and the case had to be settled by the Industrial Arbitration Court. The salary ranges of SIA's pilots were made public during the first day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearings,</b> and the press noted that the airline's 935 captains who fly the Boeing 777 received higher salaries (over S$270,000) at the midpoint of their salary brackets compared to the company's 36 vice-presidents (S$233,270).|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{publicity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commission <b>hearings,</b> however, led {{to pressure}} on elected leaders {{to get tough}} on labor racketeers.
