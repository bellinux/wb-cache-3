The area and power budget of conventionally designed <b>oversampled</b> analog-to-digital converters has precluded their application from areas where a large number of low frequency signals need to be converted simultaneously. A new <b>oversampled</b> A/D design methodology is proposed to cut the area and power budget per channel of an <b>oversampled</b> analog-todigital converter.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 <b>Oversampled</b> data {{converters}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular for high-precision data conversion. There have been many publications on <b>oversampled</b> analog-to-digital (A/D) converters but relatively few on <b>oversampled</b> digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. In this thesis, issues concerning the analysis and design of the <b>oversampled</b> D/A converters are addressed. Simulation tools and analytical methods are discussed. A novel dual-quantization technique for achieving high-precision D/A conversion is proposed. A design example is presented to demonstrate that in many aspects the proposed technique is superior to existing techniques. The thesis is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 is {{an introduction to the}} general concepts of Nyquist-rate and <b>oversampled</b> data converters. Chapter 2 describes some building blocks to be used in <b>oversampled</b> D/A converters and gives both theoretical and simulation methods for analzying them.
