5|$|A pretrial show cause {{hearing in}} the Green case began in January 1996, with Green {{represented}} by Dennis Moore and Kevin Moriarty. Green's defense claimed that {{the fire in the}} family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, who had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> caught by local police setting off Molotov cocktails. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5000|$|White Witch was a glam rock/psychedelic/hard {{rock band}} from Tampa, Florida that made two albums for Capricorn Records {{in the early}} 1970s. Their name was a paean to [...] "white magic", {{contrary}} to the [...] "black magic" [...] of groups like Black Sabbath. As the band announced before their shows: [...] "To bring good where there <b>once</b> <b>was</b> evil, to bring love where there <b>once</b> <b>was</b> hate, to bring wisdom where there <b>once</b> <b>was</b> ignorance; this {{is the power of}} White Witch".|$|R

5|$|Although it {{may have}} <b>once</b> <b>been</b> a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{never married}} {{and he kept}} no account of any romantic relationships, {{although}} his family held that he had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> in love with Teresa de Leyba, sister of Don Fernando de Leyba, the lieutenant governor of Spanish Louisiana. Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts in {{the archives of the}} Wisconsin Historical Society attest to their belief in Clark's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance.|$|E
5|$|Hamburg had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> Germany's main seaport, {{the fourth}} largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.|$|E

5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an {{extinct species}} of rail from the Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
5|$|International trade, {{facilitated}} by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors. Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. Malaysia has <b>once</b> <b>been</b> the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, although Malaysia's economic structure has been moving away from it. Malaysia {{remains one of the}} world's largest producers of palm oil.|$|E

5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over what had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> her face.|$|E
5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} <b>once</b> <b>been</b> small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They {{lend support to}} this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis, or reduction hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Richmond House {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} houses in Clifton having been built between 1701-1703 on the site of the medieval manor house burned during the Civil War, which had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> the home of Richard Amerike. The {{building}} is an English Heritage Grade II listed building. Amerike sponsored the explorer John Cabot, who sailed from Bristol in 1497 and discovered Newfoundland and is now believed by some scholars to have given his patronymic to name the continent of America.|$|E
5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work. This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish what had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had {{moved out of the}} area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E

5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has <b>once</b> <b>been</b> recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji was homosexual, and in {{the early}} 1920s he {{consulted}} Havelock Ellis, a British psychologist and writer on sexual psychology, about it. Ellis held progressive views on the subject, and Sorabji expressed high admiration for him, dedicating his Piano Concerto No. 7, Simorg-Anka (1924), to him as an expression of gratitude. Although Sorabji experienced racial harassment in his youth, his homosexuality caused him greater trouble; he wrote to Holliday that he had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> blackmailed over it.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory, {{also known}} as Project Y, was a secret {{laboratory}} established by the Manhattan Project and operated by the University of California during World War II. Its mission was to design and build the first atomic bombs. Robert Oppenheimer was its first director, from 1943 to December 1945, when he was succeeded by Norris Bradbury. For scientists freely to discuss their work while preserving security, the laboratory was located in a remote part of New Mexico. The wartime laboratory occupied buildings that had <b>once</b> <b>been</b> part of the Los Alamos Ranch School.|$|E
