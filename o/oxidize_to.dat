5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions {{are particularly important}} in the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce nitrite, which other microbes then <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form {{occurs as}} a minor component of copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{tends to}} <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> the +3 and +1 {{oxidation}} states as ionic salts. The +3 state {{resembles that of}} the other elements in group 13 (boron, aluminium, gallium, indium). However, the +1 state, which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals, and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores, and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the metabolic fate of the R and the S isomers of warfarin revealed that the two isomers were metabolized by different routes. R warfarin was <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> 6 -hydroxywarfarin and was reduced to the (R,S) warfarin alcohol. In contrast, S warfarin was <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> 7 -hydroxywarfarin and was reduced to the (S,S) warfarin alcohol. S warfarin was also <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> 6 -hydroxywarfarin...|$|R

25|$|The {{addition}} of nonpolar E–H bonds across C≡C is general for silanes, boranes, and related hydrides. The hydroboration of alkynes gives vinylic boranes which <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> the corresponding aldehyde or ketone. In the thiol-yne reaction the substrate is a thiol.|$|E
25|$|Ketones {{have been}} found to act as {{promoters}} for formation of the active cobalt(III) catalyst. In particular, ketones with a-methylene groups <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> hydroperoxides that are known to oxidize cobalt(II). Viable ketones were butanone, triacetylmethane (TAM), 2,3-pentanedione (2,3-PD), and acetylacetone; all of which can stabilize radical formation through resonance.|$|E
25|$|The Nicrosil and Nisil {{thermocouple}} alloys show greatly enhanced thermoelectric stability {{relative to}} the other standard base-metal thermocouple alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the thermoelectric instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet A (UVA) {{radiation}} {{is in the}} wavelength range 320 to 400nm. It is present more uniformly throughout the day, and throughout the year, than UVB. Most UVA is not blocked by the atmosphere's ozone layer. UVA causes the release of existing melanin from the melanocytes to combine with oxygen (<b>oxidize)</b> <b>to</b> create the actual tan color in the skin. It is blocked less than UVB by many sunscreens, but is blocked to some degree by clothing. UVA is known both to cause DNA damage and to be carcinogenic. However, it operates not by inducing direct DNA damage, but by producing reactive oxygen species which damage DNA indirectly. UVA (see above) induces a cosmetic tan but little extra melanin protection against sun damage, sun burn, or cancer.|$|E
500|$|Neptunium(III) {{hydroxide}} {{is quite}} stable in acidic solutions and in environments that lack oxygen, {{but it will}} rapidly <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> the IV state {{in the presence of}} air.

5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted in the air <b>to</b> <b>oxidize</b> it <b>to</b> the lanthanide oxides: {{while most of the}} lanthanides will be <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> the dioxide CeO2.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of decane by a cell-free particulate preparation from Candida intermedia was studied. Decane is <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> decanoate via decanol and decanaldehyde. Oxidation of decane to decanol requires molecular oxygen. Decanol is <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> decanaldehyde by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked dehydrogenase differing {{greatly in}} specificity from ordinary yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. Decanaldehyde is <b>oxidized</b> <b>to</b> decanoate by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked dehydrogenase that oxidizes long-chain aldehydes but not short-chain aldehydes. The enzymes that oxidize decane, decanol, and decanaldehyde are all induced when decane {{is present in}} the medium. These enzymes are apparently located in the cell membrane...|$|R
2500|$|The {{bright and}} pure {{colouring}} of the Persian miniature {{is one of}} its most striking features. [...] Normally all the pigments used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will <b>oxidize</b> <b>to</b> a rough-edged black over time. [...] The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or chiaroscuro. [...] Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building is (say) hexagonal in plan. [...] Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or [...] "cutaways" [...] with exterior views of other parts of a facade.
