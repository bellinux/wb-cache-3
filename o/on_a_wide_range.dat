5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus occurs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it {{is common}} on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It {{is also one of}} the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E

Oviposition has been observed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E

5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations.

The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
