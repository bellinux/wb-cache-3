40|$|Muscle {{spindles}} {{are commonly}} considered as stretch receptors encoding movement, but the functional consequence of their efferent control has remained unclear. The "alpha-gamma coactivation" hypothesis states that activity in a muscle is {{positively related to}} the <b>output</b> of its <b>spindle</b> afferents. However, {{in addition to the}} above, possible reciprocal inhibition of spindle controllers entails a negative relationship between contractile activity in one muscle and <b>spindle</b> afferent <b>output</b> from its antagonist. By recording spindle afferent responses from alert humans using microneurography, I show that <b>spindle</b> <b>output</b> does reflect antagonistic muscle balance. Specifically, regardless of identical kinematic profiles across active finger movements, stretch of the loaded antagonist muscle (i. e., extensor) was accompanied by increased afferent firing rates from this muscle compared with the baseline case of no constant external load. In contrast, spindle firing rates from the stretching antagonist were lowest when the agonist muscle powering movement (i. e., flexor) acted against an additional resistive load. Stepwise regressions confirmed that instantaneous velocity, extensor, and flexor muscle activity had a significant effect on spindle afferent responses, with flexor activity having a negative effect. Therefore, the results indicate that, as consequence of their efferent control, spindle sensitivity (gain) to muscle stretch reflects the balance of activity between antagonistic muscles rather than only the activity of the spindle-bearing muscle...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{application}} of adaptive control for power and force control in the end milling process. The spindle power and cutting force are maintained at desired levels despite the variations in the depth of cut and the workpiece properties. A first-order discrete model is used to represent {{the relationship between the}} process <b>output</b> (<b>spindle</b> power or cutting force) and the feedrate input. By open-loop experiments, the model is validated and the process parameters of the spindle power and cutting force systems are identified. The process is found to have pure time delay and can be a non-minimum phase system. A Deadbeat (DB) Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) algorithm is compared with modified MRAC, a typical scheme in existing adaptive control systems for non-minimum phase end milling processes. The design of the two controllers is described and simulations are presented. It is shown that the DB MRAC has less design complexity and superior control performance in simulation studies than the modified MRAC. Actual cutting tests of spindle power and cutting force control in the end milling process using the DB MRAC algorithm are carried out for a variety of cutting conditions. The control systems are stable with good transient and steady-state performance. The successful experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DB MRAC scheme for spindle power and cutting force control of the end milling process and the feasibility of spindle power control in adaptive control of end milling processes...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{study using}} a {{repeated}} measures design. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine if ankle proprioception is targeted in exercises on unstable surfaces. Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) has recurrence rates over 70 %, which are believed to be due to a reduced accuracy of proprioceptive signals from the ankle. Proprioceptive exercises in rehabilitation of LAS mostly consist of balancing activities on an unstable surface. The methods include 100 healthy adults stood barefoot on a solid surface and a foam pad over a force plate, with occluded vision. Mechanical vibration was used to stimulate proprioceptive <b>output</b> of muscle <b>spindles</b> of triceps surae and lumbar paraspinal musculature. Each trial lasted for 60 s; vibration was applied from the 15 th till the 30 th second. Changes in mean velocity and mean position of the center of pressure (CoP) as a result of muscle vibration were calculated. Results show that on foam, the effect of triceps surae vibration on mean CoP velocity was significantly smaller than on a solid surface, while for paraspinal musculature vibration the effect was bigger on foam than on solid surface. Similar effects were seen for mean CoP displacement as outcome. Exercises on unstable surfaces appear not to target peripheral ankle proprioception. Exercises on an unstable surface may challenge the capacity of the central nervous system to shift the weighting of sources of proprioceptive signals on balance. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} earlier, this custom-built {{machine has}} three modes of operation: NIL, photolithography and laser lithography (Fig.  1 c depicts {{a schematic of}} the lithography mechanisms). To operate the tool, a substrate (of up to 150  mm square) must be pre-coated in UV-sensitive resist before mounting on the vacuum port of the hotplate base. The feet of the hotplate may be lowered or raised to level the system. To perform photolithography or NIL, a photomask or UV-transparent stamp of base 25  mm square needs to be loaded into the recessed vacuum port on the imprinter head. The CNC software (cncGraf Pro) may then be used to position the stepper head and lower it {{into contact with the}} resist coated substrate. As the mask/stamp contacts the substrate, the springs on the stepper head compress and the compression force is measured by the load cell. The CNC software can then be used to turn on the UV LED until the resist below the mask/stamp is cured. A calibration substrate is initially required to determine both the load and exposure dose required for optimum pattern transfer because the curing time is dependent on the thickness and type of resist used and the forward current applied to the UV LED as well as composition and thickness of the mask/stamp. Once the desired load and exposure dose are determined, the process of stepping out a pattern may be automated with G-code programming (the standard CNC language) or discrete moves may be initiated by the user as and when required. Provided the substrates are flat, the calibration load may be correlated to a Z position and utilised in the automation code as the imprint position (because one cannot assign a desired pressure in G-code but one can assign a Z position). The LED may be turned on with the G-code by triggering the <b>spindle</b> <b>output.</b> The automation code also requires a Z position above the substrate in order to define a safe level of withdrawal so that any desired change to the X and Y position may be accommodated. Once the desired series of exposures/imprints have been obtained, the substrate may be removed from the machine as the lithography stage is now complete. The third lithography mechanism is laser curing. The laser source is only designed to cure a point location on a resist-coated sample surface but through automated movement may expose the resist through freehand style. The speed of motion and intensity of light may be varied. The laser assembly is set up so that it is positioned at a distance defined by the objective. With the × 20 objective present in this report, the working distance is 15  mm.|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the use of neuromechanical simulations could be used to further our understanding of the neural control mechanisms involved in the control of animal locomotion. The models used to carry out these neuromechanical simulations typically consist of a representation of the neural control systems involved in walking and a representation of the mechanical locomotor apparatus. These separate models are then integrated to produce motion of the locomotor apparatus based on signals that are generated by the neural control models. Typically in past neuromechanical simulations of human walking the parameters of the neural control model have been specifically chosen to produce a walking pattern that resembles the normal human walking pattern as closely as possible. Relatively few of these studies have systematically tested the effect of manipulating the control parameters on the walking pattern that is produced by the locomotor apparatus. The goal of this thesis was to develop models of the locomotor control system and the human locomotor apparatus and systematically manipulate several parameters of the neural control system and determine what effects these parameters would have on the walking pattern of the mechanical model. Specifically neural control models were created of the Central Pattern Generator (CPG), feedback mechanisms from muscle spindles and contact sensors that detect when the foot was contact with the ground. Two models of the human locomotor apparatus were used to evaluate the outputs of the neural control systems; the first was a rod pendulum, which represented a swinging lower-limb, while the second was a 5 -segment biped model, which included contact dynamics with the ground and a support system model to maintain balance. 	The first study of this thesis tested the ability of a CPG model to control the frequency and amplitude of the pendulum model of the lower-limb, with a strictly feedforward control mechanism. It was found that the frequency of the pendulum’s motion was directly linked (or entrained) to the frequency of the CPG’s output. It was also found that the amplitude of the pendulum’s motion was affected by the frequency of the CPG’s output, with the greatest amplitude of motion occurring when the frequency of the CPG matched the pendulum’s natural frequency. The effects of altering several other parameters of the pendulum model, such as the initial angle, the magnitude of the applied viscous damping or the moment arms of the muscles, were also analyzed. The second study again used the pendulum model, and added feedback to the neural control model, via output from simulated muscle <b>spindles.</b> The <b>output</b> from these <b>spindle</b> models was used to trigger a simulated stretch reflex. It was found that the addition of feedback led to sensory entrainment of the CPG output to the natural frequency of the pendulum. The effects of altering the muscle spindle’s sensitivity to length and velocity changes were also examined. The ability of this type of feedback system to respond to mechanical perturbations was also analyzed. The third and fourth studies used a biped model of the musculoskeletal system to assess the effects of altering the parameters of the neural control systems that were developed in the first two studies. In the third study, the neural control system consisted only of feedforward control from the CPG model. It was found that the walking speed of the biped model could be controlled by altering the frequency of the CPG’s output. It was also observed that variability of the walking pattern was decreased when there was a moderate level of inhibition between the CPGs of the left and right hip joints. The final study added feedback from muscle receptors and from contact sensors with the ground. It was found that the most important source of feedback was from the contact sensors to the extensor centres of the CPG. This feedback increased the level of extensor activity and produced significantly faster walking speeds when compared to other types of feedback. 	This thesis was successful in testing the effects of several control parameters of the neural control system on the movement of mechanical systems. Particularly important findings included the importance of connectivity between the CPGs of the left and right hip joints and positive feedback regarding the loading of the limb for establishing an appropriate forward walking speed. It is hoped that the models developed in this thesis can form the basis of future neuromechanical models and that the simulations carried out in this thesis help provide a better understanding of the interactions between neural and mechanical systems during the control of locomotion...|$|R
