5|$|The {{review was}} carried out by the Assembly's Management Services Division, the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and Symonds Group Ltd. They {{considered}} the following options, cancel the project, continue with the existing design, design a building on Site 1E, improve the existing debating chamber, construct a small one in the courtyard of Crickhowell House, and relocate to Cardiff City Hall. On 21 June 2000 it was agreed that the <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> using the RRP design should proceed.|$|E
5|$|With {{the initial}} peace treaty {{articles}} ratified in April 1783, a recently formed Congressional committee under Hamilton was considering needs {{and plans for}} a peacetime army. On May 2, 1783, the Commander in Chief submitted his Sentiments on a Peace Establishment to the Committee, essentially providing an official Continental Army position. The <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> was defeated in Congress in two votes (May 1783, October 1783), with a truncated version also being rejected in April 1784.|$|E

5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's <b>original</b> <b>proposal.</b> A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with a government agency as their occupier. The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the SIS building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} <b>original</b> <b>proposal,</b> and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E
5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure from the Law Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the <b>original</b> <b>proposal,</b> and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors.|$|E

5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> for an annexed Texas had {{embodied}} a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison {{introduced}} nine {{amendments to}} the constitution in the House of Representatives. Among his recommendations Madison proposed opening up the Constitution and inserting specific rights limiting the power of Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would {{become part of the}} ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment to the Constitution, each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> that the articles be incorporated into {{the main body of the}} Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Article One is technically still pending before the states.|$|E

5|$|Six teams {{competed for}} the T20 title {{which took place}} between 30 July and 21 August 2016. The six teams played each other once in a round robin format; {{followed}} by a finals day at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. The team that finished top of the table during the group stage qualified directly for the final, while the teams in second and third qualified for a semi-final. Both the semi-final and the final were played {{on the same day}} at the same ground. This was a change in format from the <b>original</b> <b>proposal,</b> in which the top four team qualified for the semi-finals. During the group stage, teams scored two points for a win, but gained an additional bonus point if they scored at a run rate 1.25 or more times that of their opponent.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{route of}} US-50 {{was created in}} 1976. This {{iteration}} of US-50 has its origins {{in a dispute over}} the route of Interstate 70 in Utah. While I-70 was in the planning stage Colorado lobbied for an extension of the <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> to run across Colorado and into Utah. Utah supported an extension using then US-6/50 to connect Denver, Colorado with Salt Lake City. However, federal planners did not see value in this route and instead supported a route {{that could be used to}} connect Denver with Los Angeles, California. I-70 was built using the federally selected route. In 1976, US-50 was changed again to a routing mostly concurrent with I-70. The portion of modern US-50 between Delta and Scipio had been previously numbered State Route 26, and the portion between Scipio and Salina had been numbered State Route 63, with the SR-63 portion being transferred to SR-26 in 1971.|$|E
5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting US31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but funding was not available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. Until the freeway is complete, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in the future, and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section.|$|E

5|$|After her obverse {{design was}} approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint {{engraving}} department {{six times in}} order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his <b>original</b> <b>proposal,</b> mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 19October, von Bischofhausen again met with König {{and was told that}} the <b>original</b> <b>proposal</b> was to be {{implemented}} the following day in order to collect the 2,300hostages. The following evening, the male Jews and communists, who had been held without food since their arrest, were shot by German troops at the barracks and courtyard where they were being held. Simultaneously, males between the ages of 16and 60were arrested within Kragujevac itself. They were detained in the barracks of a former motorised battalion at Stanovija Field. Over 7,000hostages were assembled. German troops and ethnic German units from the Banat were involved in the round-up, as was the Fifth Regiment of the SDK, under the command of Marisav Petrović. According to von Bischofhausen, König permitted several classes of males to be excluded from the round-up, including those with a special pass issued by von Bischofhausen's district headquarters, members of a vital profession or trade, and those who were members of Ljotić's movement. When too few adult males could be located, high school students were also rounded up. Also seized were priests and monks from the city's churches. Each hostage was registered and his belongings noted meticulously.|$|E
