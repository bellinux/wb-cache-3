The maintenance of humus balance in cultivated soils is a guarantee of the sustainability of production systems.

Accordingly, field experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate combination of application rates, placement method and C/N ratio of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> applied at transplanting time to increase rice yield and suppress paddy weed in organic rice cultivation. The treatment at the application rate of 10 gNm- 2 resulted insignificantly higher rice yield by 25 % than the treatment at the application rate of 5 gNm- 2. In addition, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to soil surface at the rate of 10 gNm- 2 increased rice yield by 31 - 45 % compared with the other treatments. The incorporation of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> into soil at a depth of 0 to 5 cm caused organic acids production that might damage rice roots, whereas they were little generated in the treatment applying the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> to soil surface. Furthermore, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N = 8 produced significantly higher (+ 83 %) weed dry weight at the harvest time than that of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 16. Consequently, the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 16 at the rate of 10 gNm- 2 to soil surface increased rice yield by 35 % and reduced weed dry weight by 93 % as compared with the incorporation of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> of C/N= 8 into soil at the rate of 5 gNm- 2.

40|$|Abstract. Energy and {{economic}} efficiencies were evaluated on young (6 year) and old (20 year) jhum fields in Mizoram, north-eastern India during {{second year of}} cropping, and were compared {{with those in the}} first year.

Energy and economic efficiencies decline with shortening of jhum cycle. These efficiencies decline further from first to second year of cropping.

40|$|Information {{about the}} {{production}} and quality of tomato cultivars under organic management and the conditions of climate and soil from the north region of Minas Gerais State, Brasil, are scarce. Thus, this research was carried out to evaluate {{the production and}} quality of tomato cultivars under organic management, in this region. The treatments consisted of four open pollination tomato cultivars (Chadwick Cherry, Pitanga vermelha, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Kada) and five hybrid cultivars (Marguerita, Nicolas, Ellen, Magestade and Dominador). The experimental design was of randomized blocks with three replications. The experiment was carried out using organic fertilization in the initial preparation of the area, compost and rock phosphate and sprays with Bordeaux mixture, neem oil and fertilizer. The marketable yield varied from 12. 3 t ha- 1 to 23. 9 t ha- 1. The hybrid Marguerita presented higher marketable production (23. 9 t ha- 1). The cultivars Chadwick Cherry and Pitanga Vermelha reached similar production as most cultivars and larger proportions of marketable and giant fruits, and therefore, better market quality. All the cultivars presented low potassium and manganese levels in foliar tissue suggesting an evaluation after various <b>organic</b> <b>manuring</b> cycles and better nutrition conditions are necessary to permit the comparison {{of the performance of}} cultivars in this system...|$|E
40|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>manuring</b> with slurry from biogas plants may {{contribute}} to plant nutrition and maintenance of soil fertility in organic farming. However, the chemical properties of biogas slurry depend markedly on substrate input and process technology. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain more insights into the relationship between the quality of biogas slurry and its influences on plant and soil parameters when applied as organic ma-nure. We studied the effects of slurries from two different biogas plants on yield of maize and soil microbial activity in a two-year field experiment. The investigation took place on a loam-clay soil near Göttingen, Lower Saxony. Biogas slurry A was obtained from a biogas plant with liquid pig manure as main input, slurry B originated from a biogas plant operated with renewable primary products. Slurries were applied as 30 and 60 m 3 ha- 1 respectively. Highest yield of maize was obtained in the treatment with slurry B when given as 60 m 3 ha- 1. N content in biomass of maize was the highest in the treatment with slurry A (60 m 3 ha- 1). β-glucosidase activity was not affected by any of the slurries. Conversely, both slurries were found to significantly increase dehydro-genase activity as well as total soil C and N contents...|$|E
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} with four replicates {{was conducted to}} study the effect of sulfate-rich water and organic manures on wheat (Trriticum aestivum L cv. Yecoro rojo) grown in heghly calcareous (CaCO 3 = 26. 5 %) loamy sand soil. Two sources of organec manures, farmyard manure (FYM) and sewage sludge were applied at three rates (0, 25 and 50 Mg ha- 1). All pots received the recommended amounts of inorganic fertilizers. Three concentrations of sulfate waters were utilized: 30, 60, and 90 mMSO 42 -. Each concentration had the same EC (5 dSm- 1), and the sodium absorption ratio (SAR) was 6. 0. Irrigation was practised with a 30 % leaching fraction. Irrigation with sulfate water affected the values of pH and EC and improved the availability of nutrients in soil. Application of either FYM or sewage sludge enriched the soil with nutrients, especially at the higher application rate. The usage of sulfate water at 60 mMSO 42 - significantly (p 0. 05) increased wheat yield and yield components. Application of FYM gave a higher yield response compared with the sludge treatment. No response was obtained with increasing the rate of FYM or sewage sludge application up to 50 Mg ha- 1. Sulfate- rich water may be safely used for irrigation at high concentrations (90 mMSO 42 -) whenever <b>organic</b> <b>manuring</b> is practiced...|$|E
40|$|The {{basic premise}} {{of this paper}} is that modern {{agricultural}} production is not sustainable in view of the high cost of chemical inputs (notably fertilizers and pesticides) used and their detrimental effects on the environment. Some of these effects are briefly discussed in this paper. The possibility of adopting organic farming as a means of promoting sustainable agriculture has been the main objective of this investigation. The results of the experiment carried out at the Chepkoilel campus farm, Moi University, Kenya to demonstrate the differences between the yields and returns to <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> and chemical fertilizers show that high yields are obtained from the use of <b>organic</b> <b>manure.</b> The high yields are also shown to be obtained in subsequent years after the application of the <b>organic</b> <b>manure.</b> This is cheaper than the application of chemical fertilizers. Maximum yields are obtained from a combination of <b>organic</b> <b>manure</b> and chemical fertilizers. <b>Organic</b> <b>manure</b> has the added advantage of providing more healthy vegetables for human consumption and ensuring optimum soil fertility for sustainable production.

Heavy <b>organic</b> <b>manuring</b> of brackishwater shrimp ponds strongly simulated the production of lablab in the initial stages of pond preparation. Obsevations suggest that the problem of detriorating water quality in the last stage of culture due to prawn burrowing/feeding activities, was exacerbated by constant addition of anures.

A highly sinificant correlation (P <. 001) between plankton (cell size < 5 microns) count and BOD was obtained. An alternative system using "kitchen ponds" stocked with artemia provided a suitable source of food for shrimp growth. Daily additionalof manure (100 kg dry weight/ha/day) produce an average 40 kg of ixed artemia and lablab protein each day during a three-month study period. Analysis of input:output ratios for the kitchen pond showed a net loss in organic matter and net gain in nitrogen yields during the conditioning period. Conditioned ponds had a net gain in both organic matter and nitrogen yields. An ares ratio of 1 : 5 for kitchen pond shrimp grow-out enable production at 700 - 1, 000 kg/ha/crop at 30, 000 pieces/ha stoking density, survival and grow-out period of 120 days.
