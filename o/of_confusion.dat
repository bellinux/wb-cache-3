50|$|In {{addition}} to predicting whether an “ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry” would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence <b>of</b> actual <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the trade-marks in the marketplace.

5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of FRELIMO, the Soviet position regarding the nationalist movements in Mozambique was one <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> There were multiple independence movements, and they had no sure knowledge that any would succeed. The nationalist groups in Mozambique, like those across Africa during the period, received training and equipment from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} Egyptian paratrooper-commando force {{managed to}} achieve a tactical and strategic victory {{at a time when}} Egypt's general situation on the battlefield was deteriorating, and GHQ was in a state <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> Sharon's advance toward Ismailia had been halted, and Second Army's logistical lines remained secure. According to Dupuy, the Israelis remained about ten kilometers south of Ismailia, now mostly a wrecked city.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a state <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> Its leadership, {{tactics and}} ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E

5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join {{of the wooden}} panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E

Though he experienced increasing periods <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{integration}} of advanced functions that enable Femto Access Points (FAPs) {{to be deployed}} in a plug-and-play manner, the femtocell concept still cause several opened issues to be resolved. One of them represents an assignment of Physical Cell Identifiers (PCIs) to FAPs. This paper analyses a random based assignment algorithm in LTE systems operating in diverse femtocell scenarios. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the number <b>of</b> <b>confusions</b> for various femtocell densities, PCI ranges and knowledge of vicinity. Simulation results show that better knowledge of vicinity can significantly reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>confusions</b> events...|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle, a state <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> spread through the French troops. Governor de Vaudreuil, who later wrote to his {{government}} and put the full blame for the French rout on the deceased Montcalm, decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore, ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with Bougainville, leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, due to {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} situation and communications difficulties, a degree <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> emerged on both sides. Out of contact with their corps headquarters, the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihać-Petrovac road, {{despite the fact that}} the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear. The critically important Petrovac-Ključ road to the south was left unguarded, endangering Tito and Supreme Partisan Headquarters as they fled from Drvar.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} sources <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> and {{ambiguity}} in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E

The Jubilee line platforms were closed on 20 November 1999, following the extension of the Jubilee line where it was diverted to Westminster and onwards south of the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about the type <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson {{wanted to do}} was to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E
5|$|The theme <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> appears {{through the}} {{transplantation}} of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that this theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own personal experience with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E
