Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times called Bad [...] "a fair-to-strong array of soul and rock blends", commenting that the record was [...] "not bad" [...] and was more [...] "reminiscent of Off the Walls uniform strength than Thrillers peaks and valleys."

500|$|Another {{generally}} positive review {{came from}} Blabbermouth.net reviewer Ray Van Horn, Jr., {{who gave the}} album a 7.5/10 score despite noting that he felt the album had numerous flaws.

Van Horn declared that the album is no Risk despite the insistence of other critics and fans, but expressed uncertainty as to which sonic direction the band might take in the future. Chad Bowar of Loudwire had a mixed <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> on the album and mainly criticized the album for being more akin to Risk and The World Needs a Hero than other recent albums.

Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave The Stripped Mixes {{two out of}} five stars, stating that he felt that [...] "the logic of what is left behind doesn't quite make sense", pointing out that [...] "I Want You Back" [...] and [...] "ABC" [...] have no drums and [...] "feel a little tipsy and top-heavy"; [...] "Ben" [...] and [...] "With a Child's Heart" [...] have echoes of strings in the background, {{making it hard to}} identify the songs as being [...] "stripped". He added that since the genius lies in the arrangements, [...] "having so much of the arrangement absent" [...] means that the music [...] "just sounds awkward and incomplete, as if it was waiting for the final round of mixing and overdubs." [...] Erlewine's <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> on the album was [...] "if the purpose of this disc is to draw attention to Michael's vocals, The Stripped Mixes does its job, but just because his voice is pushed front and center does not mean that this is the best place to appreciate his genius." ...|$|E

He rated it 7.5/10, signifying a good episode, though his <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> was mixed. Canning commented that the Hummels' relationship is [...] "the most affecting" [...] of the show, and praised O'Malley's [...] "outstandingly nuanced" [...] performance as Burt, yet felt that the religious element gave the episode an after school special vibe and almost became [...] "over-the-top preachy and self-important". VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "B-", commenting that he was uncertain whether he genuinely loved it, or was overlooking flaws because it handled the religious element acceptably. VanDerWerff stated {{that it would be}} easy to criticize Glee, but while television as a whole does not do earnestness well, Glee at its best, as in [...] "Grilled Cheesus", [...] "revels in just how damn earnest it can be". James Poniewozik of Time wrote that the episode's premise was [...] "absurdly ambitious", yet felt it was largely successful in being respectful to both atheism and religion. He criticized the musical numbers for detracting from the plot, but appreciated the focus on Kurt and Burt, also naming theirs one of Glee [...] "strongest and most nuanced relationships".|$|E

The Soviet government had destroyed the Christ the Savior Cathedral in the 1930s (it was rebuilt in the 1990s), adding to the location's significance to believers. At {{the conclusion of the}} trial, a series of Levada Center polls showed that, of 1600 Russians surveyed in 45 cities nationwide, 42% also believed Pussy Riot had been arrested for insulting the shrines and beliefs of the Orthodox Church. Meanwhile, 29% saw it as a case of general hooliganism, while only 19% saw it as a political protest against Putin. <b>Overall</b> <b>opinion</b> was for the most part negative or indifferent. Only 6% sympathised with Pussy Riot, while 41% felt antipathy towards them. 44% believed the trial was [...] "fair and impartial", while 17% believed it was not. Of those following the case, 86% favored some form of punishment, ranging from prison to forced labor or fines, while 5% said they should not have been punished at all. A prison sentence of 2 to 7 years was seen as appropriate by 33%, whereas 43% saw two or more years as excessive, and a further 15% said the defendants should not have been prosecuted in court.

One critic described the performance as being “smothered by Craig’s screens”. [...] The <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> of the Russian critics was that Craig’s modern concept distracted from the play itself. However, Nikolay Efros, insisted that despite the flaws of the production, the theatre must be admired {{for the things that}} they aspired to achieve, and the immense amount of work they put in. The press in England [...] was much kinder, and rumors spread very quickly through western Europe of the great triumph of Craig’s vision, despite the production in actuality being a complete failure. While Olga Knipper (Gertrude), Nikolai Massalitinov (Claudius) and Olga Gzovskaia (Ophelia) received poor reviews in the Russian press, Vasili Kachalov's performance as Hamlet was praised as a genuine achievement, one which succeeded in displacing the legend of Mochalov's mid-19th-century Romantic Hamlet.|$|E
40|$|Numerous client {{reports of}} {{products}} {{at the moment}} {{are available on the}} internet. Purchaser studies contain wealthy and valuable capabilities for both businesses and users. Nevertheless, the reports are on the whole disorganized, leading to difficulties in expertise navigation and talents acquisition. This article proposes a product facet ranking framework, which robotically identifies the major elements of merchandise from on-line customer experiences, aiming at bettering the usability of the numerous reports. The most important product points are recognized based on two observations: 1) the important aspects are usually commented on by a large number of consumers. 2) consumer opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their <b>overall</b> <b>opinions</b> on the product. In particular, given the purchaser studies of a product, first establish product features {{with the aid of a}} shallow dependency parser and investigate purchaser opinions on these facets by way of a sentiment classifier. Then enhance a probabilistic facet rating algorithm to deduce the value of features by simultaneously in view that side frequency and the affect of patron opinions given to each part over their <b>overall</b> <b>opinions.</b> The experimental outcome on a review corpus of 21 widespread products in eight domains display the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Furthermore, apply product part ranking to two actual-world functions, i. e., report-degree sentiment classification and extractive evaluate summarization, and attain huge performance improvements, which show the potential of product part ranking in facilitating actual-world functions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Duhuo Jisheng Wan (DJW) {{is perhaps}} the best known and most widely used Chinese herbal recipe for arthralgia, but the {{clinical}} study to verify its efficacy is lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the efficacy of DJW versus diclofenac in symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Methods This study was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled trial. The 200 patients suffering from OA of the knee, were randomized into the DJW and diclofenac group. The patients were evaluated after a run-in period of one week (week 0) and then weekly during 4 weeks of treatment. The clinical assessments included visual analog scale (VAS) score that assessed pain and stiffness, Lequesne's functional index, time for climbing up 10 steps, as well as physician's and patients' <b>overall</b> <b>opinions</b> on improvement. Results Ninety four patients in each group completed the study. In the first few weeks of treatment, the mean changes in some variables (VAS, which assessed walking pain, standing pain and stiffness, as well as Lequesne's functional index) of the DJW group were significantly lower than those of the diclofenac group. Afterwards, these mean changes became no different throughout the study. Most of the physician's and patients' <b>overall</b> <b>opinions</b> on improvement at each time point did not significantly differ between the two groups. Approximately 30 % of patients in both groups experienced mild adverse events. Conclusion DJW demonstrates clinically comparable efficacy to diclofenac after 4 weeks of treatment. However, the slow onset of action as well as approximately equal rate of adverse events to diclofenac might limit its alternative role in treatment of OA of the knee. </p...|$|R

In 1906, Prince George welcomed to Paris the Romanian student Eugen Lovinescu, directing his own research on J.-J. Weiss. At the time, as [...] "James Caterly", he published the monograph Les Roumains (1908), which Lovinescu would translate and publish in Romania in 1909 or 1910. Știrbei's new protege was reserved in his <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> of the prince, writing that his Paris home resembled an old [...] "boyar mansion", replete with objets d'art from the Orient.

From the 1880s onward, he had slowly divided his art objects were between the Louvre, the École des Beaux-Arts, and the Angers and Valenciennes Museums; others preserved at their original location in Bécon.

2500|$|The anime series, {{directed}} by Takayuki Inagaki {{who has worked}} on Desert Punk and Indian Summer, has an abundance of fanservice and panty shots that have been heavily criticized from reviewers in manga and anime, who have compared the show to panty-ridden series such as Najica Blitz Tactics and Agent Aika. Lumbard was disgusted by the fanservice of weird sexual imagery around Yukari, and lowered his <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> of the second anime series because of it. Høgset wrote that the series was like Shuffle! with more fanservice with [...] "average 'all the girls dotes on the guy' stupidity". Deb Aoki found the fanservice in the manga to be a bit unwholesome and cheesy, but underneath were teen themes about friendship, loyalty, and courage. Reception on the characters' fanservice has been acknowledged by Ikeda. In the bonus comics at the end of Season II, Volume 6, Ikeda responds to a fan letter that criticizes that the Newspaper Club girls artwork in the manga is not as moe as in the anime by having them go over aspects of moe that has already incorporated such as cat ears, knee socks, large breasts, twin tails, long bangs, as well as what the girls would look like when drawn with large eyes, distinguishing accessories and speech inflections. When asked in an interview about the fewer panty shots compared to other shōnen manga; Ikeda replied that he favors showing less as it would be more erotic and intriguing.|$|E

Although {{disappointed}} by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese {{on the set of}} Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the director's chair, claiming {{he had no idea what}} Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, [...] "A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp." [...] His <b>overall</b> <b>opinion</b> of sport in general is, [...] "Anything with a ball, no good." [...] The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said [...] "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be [...] "an allegory for whatever you do in life”, which for him paralleled moviemaking, “you make movies, you’re in the ring each time.” ...|$|E
