Maryse Bourdon, Luc's stepmother, said he had purchased the motorcycle about three weeks before. Letang, Bourdon's close friend and former roommate from junior hockey, planned to buy a motorcycle after Bourdon told him about his; because of the crash, he decided against it.|$|E

'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> down the street from where Brad and I work, a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which has been really sad to witness."

2500|$|Unlike a {{generation}} <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>ago,</b> many colleges with music programs now offer {{students the opportunity}} to major in euphonium. [...] However, due to the small number of euphonium students at most schools (2–4 is common), it is possible, and even likely, that they will study with a professor whose major instrument is not the euphonium. [...] Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.|$|E

30|$|In {{view of the}} {{positive}} effects of innovations {{it is not surprising that}} in politics and in the public the call for more innovative efforts abounds. Innovations bring relief from physically exhausting work, drive up labor productivity, enable per capita income growth, yield competitive advantages both nationally and internationally, create new employment opportunities, result in new goods and services – in short: have improved the human lot dramatically as compared to one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> centuries <b>ago.</b> Works on the effects of innovations (the third of the mentioned major research themes) – certainly almost all of the neo-Schumpeterian contributions – highlight more or less exclusively these positive effects of innovative activities. Likewise, the management literature propagates innovations as prime strategy for gaining a competitive advantage and generating sustained profits.|$|R

50|$|The Government of the Republic of the Congo {{does not}} fully comply with the minimum {{standards}} {{for the elimination of}} trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. The Senate passed the Child Protection Code in August 2009, which prescribes penalties for trafficking offenders; this law is pending Presidential signature. The government also developed and began implementation of a national anti-trafficking action plan, and the Ministry of Labor investigated nine new cases of child trafficking in 2009. However, eight prosecutions based on child trafficking charges filed one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> years <b>ago</b> remained pending and did not come to conclusion or result in convictions. The government did not identify trafficking victims in 2009. Most of the government’s anti-trafficking activities remain dependent on international donor funding.|$|R
30|$|The use of noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) strongly increased {{during the}} last twenty years, and became a common technique for managing acute and chronic respiratory failures. In response to a growing market, manufacturers propose yearly (if not more often) new ventilators with {{an increasing number of}} ventilatory modes and settings. Our objective is to help the physicians to improve the synchronization between the ventilator pressure cycles and patient breathing cycles, a key feature to optimize comfort and reduce the work of breathing [1]. The number of parameters available in a modern ventilator is indeed significantly greater than in those produced one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> decades <b>ago.</b> Unfortunately, the terminology used to designate these ventilator settings remains not unified and the same abbreviation can sometimes correspond to different quantities, as clearly pointed out long time ago [2]. Such disparities make a comparison between the different ventilators difficult to establish.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a highly}} {{dangerous}} bird flu has infected over 130 patients in China, and the outbreak {{was attributed to}} a novel avian-origin H 7 N 9 virus.

We also identified a potentially optimal 9 -mer epitope, which can be helpful for vaccine development. The interaction of hemagglutinin (HA) and human receptor analog was confirmed by structural modeling, while NA might influence cellular processes through a PDZ-binding motif. A simplified virus infection model was proposed. Taken together, our studies provide {{a better understanding of}} the newly reassorted H 7 N 9 viruses...|$|R
