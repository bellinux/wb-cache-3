25|$|After {{dropping}} the float, the Cuban squadron chief ordered {{the commander of}} CS-13, Ensign Mario Ramirez Delgado, to explore the area pointed out by the plane. <b>Once</b> the <b>order</b> <b>was</b> <b>received,</b> the CS-13 sailed speedily toward the area, where the patrol boat's sonar received a clear and precise contact at 900 yards. The seaman operating the sonar, Norberto Collado Abreu, was glued to the equipment, without missing a sound. Then the attack started: three depth charges set to explode at 100, 150, and 250 feet, were dropped from the stern, {{in accordance with the}} calculated speed of the submarine.|$|R
50|$|A signal {{presenting}} the 'stop' aspect cannot be passed {{under any circumstances}} without a formal order from the train controller. This <b>order</b> can <b>be</b> transmitted in writing or by radio. In the latter case the driver must repeat the order word for word. <b>Once</b> this <b>order</b> has <b>been</b> <b>received,</b> the driver can proceed at a speed slow enough that they may stop short of any obstruction de 40 km/h.This restrictive procedure requires very slow operation. There is a complementary signal, shown below, which gives the order 'Proceed on sight' without needing a written order, {{so as to avoid}} huge delays in case a signal breaks down.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Minuteman missile launch crews, <b>once</b> a launch <b>order</b> <b>is</b> <b>received,</b> both {{operators}} must {{agree that it is}} valid by comparing the authorization code in the order against a Sealed Authenticator (a special sealed envelope which holds the code). These Sealed Authenticators are stored in a safe which has two separate locks. Each operator has the key to only one lock, so neither can open the safe alone. Also, each operator has one of two launch keys; <b>once</b> the <b>order</b> <b>is</b> verified, they must insert the keys in slots on the control panel and turn them simultaneously. A total of four keys are thus required to initiate a launch. For additional protection, the missile crew in another launch control center must do the same for the missiles to be launched. As a further precaution, the slots for the two launch keys are positioned far enough apart to make it impossible for one operator to reach both of them at once.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study on}} a problem of production and distribution planning. The problem considers a make-to-order production-distribution system with one manufacturer and many customers. The manufacturer (at the depot) produces the products <b>once</b> customer <b>orders</b> have <b>been</b> <b>received.</b> Distributions to the customers associated {{with a set of}} <b>orders</b> should <b>be</b> done before the customer's due date to avoid any penalty for delay. The problem is the extension of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Release and Due Dates (VRPRDD) where deliveries start depending on the fix release dates. To achieve optimum efficiency in planning, it makes sense to coordinate production schedule with distribution planning. This {{is the subject of this}} study. The classical approach which treats these two planning sequentially is proposed, in which VNS is used as optimization method since it shows to be the most competent heuristic in the VRPRDD. The results shown that integrating production schedule and routing vehicle is significantly better compared to VRPRDD...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem we}} {{consider}} {{in this study}} is Time Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (TDVRP) which has been categorized as non-classical VRP. It is motivated by the fact that multinational companies are currently not only manufacturing the demanded products but also distributing them to the customer location. This implies an efficient synchronization of production and distribution activities. Hence, this study will look into the routing of vehicles which departs from the depot at varies time due to the variation in manufacturing process. We consider a single production line where demanded products are being process one at a time <b>once</b> <b>orders</b> have <b>been</b> <b>received</b> from the customers. It <b>is</b> assumed that <b>order</b> released from the production line will be loaded into scheduled vehicle which ready to be delivered. However, the delivery could only <b>be</b> done <b>once</b> all <b>orders</b> scheduled in the vehicle have been released from the production line. Therefore, there could be lateness on the delivery process from awaiting all customers’ order of the route to be released. Our objective is to determine a schedule for vehicle routing that minimizes the solution cost including the travelling and tardiness cost. A mathematical formulation is developed to represent the problem and will be solved by two metaheuristics; Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Tabu Search (TS). These algorithms will be coded in C++ programming and run using 56 ’s Solomon instances with some modification. The outcome of this experiment can be interpreted as the quality criteria of the different approximation methods. The comparison done shown that VNS gave the better results while consuming reasonable computational efforts...|$|R
50|$|In 2016 after 44 {{years of}} production, Lockeed Martin stopped {{assembling}} F-16 in Fort Worth, TX. Procurement of new F-16 Block 70 {{is still an}} option for Slovak Air Force. Lockheed will begin moving the production line to its new facility in Greenville, S.C., {{at the end of}} the year after delivering the last of the iconic jets being built for Iraq in September 2017, said Ken Ross, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth. But since the company hasn’t booked any orders for new F-16s beyond the planes for Iraq, it would take about two years to start it back up in South Carolina <b>once</b> a new <b>order</b> <b>is</b> <b>received,</b> Ross said. Considering the condition of Slovak MIG-29 fighters and the need to replace them by 2019 (when the service contract for MIG-29s expires), this option remains unlikely. Slovakia would have to extend the service contract for MIG-29s with Russia which in current political environment would be controversial, if not impossible. Although there´s still an option of purchasing used F-16s which could be delivered sooner.|$|R
