500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis.</b> This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E

40|$|Hypernatremia is {{a common}} problem in {{critically}} ill patients. Part {{of the reason for}} the inadequate treatment of hypernatremia may be that we tend to replace only the free water deficit (FWD) and neglect replacing ongoing losses of free water. In most cases, ongoing losses of free water occur in the urine, the quantity of which can be easily calculated using the electrolyte free water clearance (EFWC). We report a case of man presenting with tube feeding syndrome (TFS) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). He developed life-threatening hypernatremia from an <b>osmotic</b> urea <b>diuresis</b> that was appropriately treated by replacing both the FWD as well as ongoing free water losses calculated from the EFWC. A 37 year-old man in a persistent vegetative state from a left thalamic hemorrhage status post ventriculostomy and PEG tube placement was admitted with sepsis and HHNS. He was receiving large amounts of Jevity 1. 2. He had acute kidney injury due to severe volume depletion from an <b>osmotic</b> urea <b>diuresis.</b> BUN was 200  mg/dL, sodium was 165  mEq/L, glucose was 635  mg/dL, and serum osmolality was 449  mOsm/kg. To prevent the development of cerebral edema from overly rapid correction of hyperosmolality, he was started on an insulin drip and hypernatremia was allowed to persist until the hyperglycemia was fully normalized. This was followed by correcting the hypernatremia over 3 days. He was urinating up to about 4 L/day of mostly electrolyte free water. Using the FWD to arrive at the rate of free water administration, he would only have received 2  L of free water per day and hypernatremia would have persisted. Instead, he required about 4. 5  L/day of free water as calculated by the FWD and EFWC together, and his hypernatremia resolved as expected. Our patient presented with a triad of TFS including hypernatremia, dehydration, and azotemia. Rapidly increased fluid loss from sepsis and HHNS initially caused severe hypernatremia.

40|$|Purpose: Although nocturnal {{polyuria}} {{in patients}} with monosymptomatic enuresis can largely {{be explained by the}} decreased nocturnal vasopressin secretion hypothesis, other circadian rhythms in the kidney also seem to have a role. We recently documented an absent day/night rhythm in a subgroup of desmopressin refractory cases. We explore the importance of abnormal circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration and tubular (sodium, potassium) parameters {{in patients with}} monosymptomatic enuresis. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study of a tertiary enuresis population we collected data subsequent to a standardized screening (International Children's Continence Society questionnaire), 14 -day diary for nocturnal enuresis and diuresis, and 24 -hour concentration profile. The study population consisted of 139 children with nocturnal enuresis who were 5 years or older. Children with nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were used as controls. Results: There was a maintained circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration, sodium, <b>osmotic</b> excretion and <b>diuresis</b> rate in children with monosymptomatic and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, and {{there was no difference between}} the 2 groups. Secondary analysis revealed that in patients with nocturnal polyuria (with monosymptomatic or nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis) circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration, sodium and <b>osmotic</b> excretion, and <b>diuresis</b> rate was diminished in contrast to those without nocturnal polyuria (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Circadian rhythm of the kidney does not differ between patients with nonmonosymptomatic and monosymptomatic enuresis. However, the subgroup with enuresis and nocturnal polyuria has a diminished circadian rhythm of nocturnal diuresis, sodium excretion and glomerular filtration in contrast to children without nocturnal polyuria.

40|$|Evidence for {{the site}} of action of {{diuretic}} drugs in man {{can be derived from}} observations of their effect on different tubular functions. Previous studies have shown that mercurial diuretic agents have little influence on water diuresis or antidiuresis (1 - 5) and hydrogen ion secretion (6, 7). These observations have been taken to indicate that the predominant action of these mercurial agents is to decrease sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. A proximal site of action has also been suggested by stop flow analysis of tubular function during combined mercurial and mannitol diuresis (8 - 10). The similarity between <b>osmotic</b> and mercurial <b>diuresis</b> has been emphasized (5, 8, 11, 12) but these states have not been compared directly in man. The present study concerns the effects of diuretic drugs on renal concentrating ability in healthy hydropenic young men. The urine was found to be less concentrated during mercurial diuresis when compared with mannitol diuresis at similar urine flows. This difference was greatest when mercurial action was potentiated by the prior administration of ammonium chloride. The data provide evidence that mercurial diuretic agents can act on those portions of the nephron involved in the renal concentrating process, presumably beyond the proximal tubule. Acetazolamide and chlorothiazide, drugs which probably act both distally and proximally (8, 13 - 15) were also studied.

As blood pressure increases, the kidney removes the excess fluid as urine.

50|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>diuresis</b> is the {{increase}} of urination rate caused {{by the presence of}} certain substances in the small tubes of the kidneys. The excretion occurs when substances such as glucose enter the kidney tubules and cannot be reabsorbed (due to a pathological state or the normal nature of the substance). The substances cause an increase in the osmotic pressure within the tubule, causing retention of water within the lumen, and thus reduces the reabsorption of water, increasing urine output (i.e. diuresis). The same effect can be seen in therapeutics such as mannitol, which is used to increase urine output and decrease extracellular fluid volume.|$|E
50|$|The BUN:Cr in renal {{azotemia}} is {{less than}} 15. In cases of renal disease, glomerular filtration rate decreases, so nothing gets filtered {{as well as it}} normally would.

50|$|In {{diabetic}} ketoacidosis, a {{high concentration}} of ketone bodies is usually accompanied by insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and dehydration. Particularly in type 1 diabetics the lack of insulin in the bloodstream prevents glucose absorption, thereby inhibiting the production of oxaloacetate (a crucial molecule for processing Acetyl-CoA, the product of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, in the Krebs cycle) through reduced levels of pyruvate (a byproduct of glycolysis), and can cause unchecked ketone body production (through fatty acid metabolism) potentially leading to dangerous glucose and ketone levels in the blood. Hyperglycemia results in glucose overloading the kidneys and spilling into the urine (transport maximum for glucose is exceeded). Dehydration results following the osmotic movement of water into urine (<b>Osmotic</b> <b>diuresis),</b> exacerbating the acidosis.|$|E
50|$|When a type 1 {{diabetic}} {{suffers a}} biological stress event (infection, heart attack, or physical trauma), or fails to administer enough insulin they may enter the pathological state of hyperglycemic ketoacidosis. Under these circumstances, the low or absent insulin {{levels in the}} blood, combined with the inappropriately high glucagon concentrations, induce the liver to produce glucose at an inappropriately increased rate, causing acetyl-CoA resulting from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, to be converted into ketone bodies. The resulting very high levels of ketone bodies lower the pH of the blood plasma which reflexively triggers the kidneys to excrete a very acid urine. The high levels of glucose and ketones in the blood also spill, passively, into the urine (the ability of the renal tubules to reabsorb glucose and ketones from the tubular fluid, being overwhelmed by the high volumes of these substances being filtered into the tubular fluid). The resulting <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis</b> of glucose causes the removal of water and electrolytes from the blood resulting in potentially fatal dehydration.|$|E
5000|$|This symptom is {{characteristically}} {{found in}} diabetics, often {{as one of}} the initial symptoms, and in those who fail to take their anti-diabetic medications or whose condition is poorly controlled.

This is usually a result of <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis.</b> Diabetes insipidus ("tasteless" [...] diabetes, as opposed to diabetes mellitus) can also cause polydipsia. Polydipsia is also a symptom of anticholinergic poisoning. Zinc is also known to reduce symptoms of polydipsia by causing the body to absorb fluids more efficiently (reduction of diarrhea, induces constipation) and it causes the body to retain more sodium; thus a zinc deficiency can be a possible cause. The combination of polydipsia and (nocturnal) polyuria is also seen in (primary) hyperaldosteronism (which often goes with hypokalemia).Antipsychotics can have side effects such as dry mouth that may make the patient feel thirsty.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{polyuria}} in both adults and children is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, which causes <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis,</b> when glucose levels are so high that glucose is excreted in the urine. Water follows the glucose concentration passively, leading to abnormally high urine output. In the absence of diabetes mellitus, the {{most common cause}}s are decreased secretion of aldosterone due to adrenal cortical tumor, primary polydipsia (excessive fluid drinking), central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Polyuria may also be due to various chemical substances, such as diuretics, caffeine, and ethanol. It may also occur after supraventricular tachycardias, during an onset of atrial fibrillation, childbirth, and the removal of an obstruction within the urinary tract. Diuresis is controlled by antidiuretics such as vasopressin, angiotensin II and aldosterone. Cold diuresis is the occurrence of increased urine production on exposure to cold, which also partially explains immersion diuresis. High-altitude diuresis occurs at altitudes above 10000 ft and is a desirable indicator of adaptation to high altitudes. Mountaineers who are adapting well to high altitudes experience this type of diuresis. Persons who produce less urine even in the presence of adequate fluid intake are probably not adapting well to altitude.|$|E

It was {{towards the end}} of the 18 th century that a curiosity arose about what {{controlled}} the flow of urine.

This puzzling phenomenon might have been understood had Ségalas's and Wöhler's observations been properly appreciated, that an extra load of urea, or any other substance that is excreted by the kidney, causes a diuresis. Nevertheless, these experiments were forgotten, and because of Bowman's and Ludwig's studies fluctuations in urine flow were ascribed to changes in blood pressure. It was not until 1870 to 1880 that Ustimowitsch, Falck and Richet stressed the role of urinary solutes on urine flow. Around 1900, Cushny also studied the diuretic effect of different solutes excreted in the urine and actually described what is now called an <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis,</b> though he did not use the term. These studies enabled him to deliver his “modern view” of the Secretion of the Urine.

40|$|Bicarbonate {{reabsorption}} in {{the thick}} ascending limb of Henle's loop was examined by studies of free-water clearance (CH 2 O) and free-water reabsorption (TcH 2 O). During maximal water diuresis in the dog, CH 2 O/GFR was taken as an indes of sodium reabsorption in, and urine flow (V/GFR) as an index of delivery of filtrate to, this scarbonate, infusion of a nonreabsorbable solute (hypotonic mannitol) and administration of an inhibitor of bicarbonate reabsorption (acetaent, but less than that achieved with hypotonic saline infusion. This suggests that sodium that sodium bicarbonate is not reabsorbed in the ascending limb. Rather, it is the sodium chloride, swept out of the proximal tubule by <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis</b> due to nonreabsorbed mannitol or sodium bicarbonate, that is reabsorbed in the ascending limb thereby increasing CH 2 O, whereas the nonreabsorption of mannitol and sodium bicarbonate results in a depressed CH 20 per unit V when compared with hypotonic saline. V/GFR is not a satisfactory index of delivery to the ascending limb during <b>osmotic</b> <b>diuresis,</b> since it includes water obligated by nonreabsorbable solutes. When a better index of delivery, {{the sum of the}} clearances of chloride (CC 1) and free-water (CH 2 O) is used, hypotonic bicarbonate infusion, hypotonic mannitol infusion and acetazolamide administration increase CH 2 O/GFR per unit delivery to the same extent as odes hypotonic saline infusion. Studies in dogs and rats on TcH 2 O also indicate that sodium bicarbonate is an impermeant solute in the ascending limb. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>diuresis</b> due to sodium bicarbonate diuresis, produced either by inhibition of sodium bicarbonate reabsorption (acetazolamide, L-lysine mono-hydrochloride) or infusion of sodium bicarbonate, or mannitol diuresis both produced marked chloruresis and increased TcH 2 O to the same extent as did hypertonic saline infusion. If chloride excretion was almost eliminated by hemodialysis against a chloride-free dialysate (dogs) or prolonged feeding of a salt-free diet (rats), TcH 2 O formation was unimpaired if hypertonic saline was infused but virtually obliterated during mannitol or sodium bicarbonate diuresis. Sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb, therefore, appears to be dependent upon chloride as the accompanying anion. At any given rate of bicarbonate excretion, more cloride is delivered out of the proximal tubule (as estimated from CC 1 + CH 2 O) with hypotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion than with acetazolamide administration.

Rats were fed a 4 % high-salt diet (HSD) or a 5 % high-urea diet (HUD) for 2 wk and compared with the control rats fed a regular diet containing 1 % NaCl. The urine urea concentration decreased in HSD but increased in HUD. In the IM, UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 urea transporters, CLC-K 1 chloride channel, and tonicity-enhanced binding protein (TonEBP) transcription factor were all increased in HSD and decreased in HUD. Next, rats were fed an 8 % low-protein diet (LPD) or a 0. 4 % low-salt diet (LSD) to decrease the total urinary solute. Urine urea concentration significantly decreased in LPD but significantly increased in LSD. Rats fed the LPD had increased UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 in the IM base but decreased in the IM tip, resulting in impaired urine concentrating ability. The LSD rats had decreased UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 in both portions of the IM. CLC-K 1 and TonEBP were unchanged by LPD or LSD.
