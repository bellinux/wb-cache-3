In addition, power protocol {{can also be used to}} reduce the switching activity between on-chip L1 cache and on-chip L2 cache (although the results would not be as good as those with the off-chip bus). In fact, <b>our</b> <b>strategy</b> can be used between any two communicating devices in the system (with the VC support). Further, we are not restricted by point-to-point configurations. That is, our approach can be made to work in an environment where multiple devices are communicating over a shared (power-hungry) data bus.Obviously, in this case, among other things, we would need a coherence mechanism (the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this paper). A drawback of <b>our</b> <b>strategy</b> is the extra space needed by two value caches (one on-chip and the other off-chip). In this paper, we do not present a detailed study of the circuit space implications of our approach. As will be presented in the experimental results section, even a small VC (128 entries) generates reasonably good energy behavior; so, we can expect that the space overhead due to our optimization will not be excessive.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) code {{assignment}} to eliminate primary and hidden collisions in multihop packet radio networks {{has been widely}} researched in the past. However, very little {{work has been done}} on the very realistic *distributed, dynamic* version of the transmitter-oriented code assignment (TOCA) problem in an ad-hoc network where mobiles use CDMA technology. None of the existing dynamic TOCA CDMA algorithms in literature are efficient, in terms of maximum code index assigned in the network, or number of times a mobile has to change its code. We present a set of local and distributed *recoding* strategies for the TOCA CDMA problem in an ad-hoc network where mobiles can arbitrarily 1) connect and disconnect, 2) move about, and 3) increase or decrease their transmission power - all these may need some mobiles to be recoded, to avoid new collisions. <b>Our</b> <b>strategies,</b> unlike those proposed earlier in literature, guarantee *minimal recoding*, that is, given a current network-wide code assignment and one of the above events, <b>our</b> <b>strategies</b> change the codes of the minimum number of mobiles needed to eliminate all collisions. Minimal recoding can be very important in reducing the effect of frequent code changes on the performance and criticality of distributed applications. Further, among all possible minimal recoding strategies in a class, most of <b>our</b> <b>strategies</b> are also (provably) *optimal* in terms of the maximum code index assigned in the network.
