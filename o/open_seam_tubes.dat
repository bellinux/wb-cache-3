The analysis from employing Six Sigma and DMAIC indicated that the broken stitch and <b>open</b> <b>seam</b> influenced the number of defective products.

Thus, a reduction of about 35 % in the garments defect was achieved, which helped the organization studied to reduce its defects and thus improve its Sigma level from 1. 7 to 3. 4...|$|R

40|$|Thin walled {{calandria}} tubes for pressurised {{heavy water}} reactors are manufactured either by seam welding of Zircaloy- 4 sheets or by seamless route. In the present study, {{the effect of}} processing on the critical properties such as texture, microstructure, hydriding behaviour and residual stress for both the routes {{as well as the}} mechanical anisotropy developed due to seam welding are investigated. The properties of the <b>seam</b> welded <b>tube</b> in the fusion and adjoining region are markedly different from the base material and from the seamless tube. Residual stress measurements indicate that heat affected zone (HAZ) of <b>seam</b> welded <b>tubes</b> have longitudinal tensile residual stress and the seamless tubes have uniform compressive stress along the circumference. The phase transition in the presence of residual stresses due to thermal gradient is found to modify the texture in the HAZ. The hydride orientation and mechanical anisotropy in these regions are found to be dependent on the texture of the material. © Elsevie...|$|R
5000|$|While her {{forepart}} planted {{firmly on}} the shelving shore her stern was floating in 30 feet of water.

50|$|The Mallard was {{designed}} in the 1940s with a so-called 'wet wing' where the fuel tanks, instead of being separate items within the wing, are constructed from sealed-off portions of the wing structure itself. This eliminates the additional weight of the tanks and also allows more fuel to be contained within a given wing size. The drawback of this form of construction {{is that all the}} joints around the tank seams must be sealed in order to ensure the tank is fuel-tight. In addition, the normal flexing of the wing in flight has a tendency to <b>open</b> <b>seams</b> over extended periods of time, leading to fuel leaks. Grumman, the manufacturer, had issued warnings as early as 1963 about fuel leaks from the Mallard's wing being indicative of possible structural problems. However, for unknown reasons the airline did not consider this particularly relevant to its own aircraft.|$|R

40|$|All textile {{industries}} aim {{to produce}} competitive textiles. The competition enhancement depends mainly on productivity {{and quality of}} the textiles produced by each industry. Especially in the least developed countries like Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh where textile {{is one of the main}} incomes of economy, still using manual quality control techniques to identify defects in their textile products. Therefore this study carries out to classify defects in textiles with minimum intervention of human being using artificial neural network technology and some principles of image processing techniques. My approach is to identify defects in textile comprises three steps, namely, image processing, image classification and producing the output as a classification chart. I have used the standard techniques of image processing; while the image classification is handled by an ANN trained in the supervised mode with the aid of back propagation training algorithm. I have selected three major defect types of defects from textile quality process. They are cut hole damages, <b>open</b> <b>seam</b> of the garment and pen marks. Input data is a 185220 x 30 matrix and it is representing 30 samples of 185220 elements. The output of the system will be an image file with a defect classification chart. In fact, basically this system is able to classify defects in to three categories. This system mainly is divided in to three sections namely; image processing module, neural network module and output generator module. But the system design is separated in to two parts. The first part of the research processes the images to fit for the input layer of the neural network. The second part uses the input set to classify the defects and adapts the neural net. The prototype develop in this project have been trained to identify cut hole damages, <b>open</b> <b>seam</b> and pen mark of the garments by considering 300 images. A concatenate image, which contained 300 samples of each defect type, was trained and tested. The accuracy rate of recognizing the numbers and symbols were 77 %. However this accuracy rate is very high. Using the neural network technology and back propagation learning algorithm, to classify textile defects were successful even there was a high probability to misclassify different types of defect images with different range of severity rates...|$|R

The buildings in this city are very close together, almost like overlapping, have rectangular shapes and are painted in happy and bright colors. Also, the ocean proximity next to these buildings, the blue color of the water, fading from darker to lighter, inspired me to choose the color blocking technique. The challenge was to create a structured over garment inspired by such a destination, rather than a casual look. I decided to use color blocking with square shapes, so the added challenge was to sew perfect interior corners on all the pieces. Moreover, the innovative 3 -D pocket {{on the front of the}} jacket was created based on inseam concealed pocket construction and it required a few tries on a muslin.
