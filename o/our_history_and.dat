5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in <b>our</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

Funded by the Aber Valley Heritage Group and their patron Roy Noble, with matched funding from the Welsh Government, a bronze statue by Les Johnson depicting a rescue worker coming {{to the aid of}} one of the survivors of the explosion, was unveiled by Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales.

On 19 January 1978 the Secretary of State for Education and Science, Shirley Williams, accepted the proposal stating that HMS Belfast [...] "is a unique demonstration of an important phase of <b>our</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> technology". The ship {{was transferred to the}} museum on 1 March 1978, and became the Imperial War Museum's third branch, Duxford aerodrome having been acquired in 1976. In October 1998, the HMS Belfast Association was formed to reunite former members of the ship’s company.

500|$|The College of Arms had {{informed}} Wimbledon F.C. in August 2002 that its {{continued use of}} the Wimbledon double-headed eagle device for its logo was illegal, so the club adopted a new badge before the 2003–04 season. It featured a stylised eagle's head drawn in navy blue and yellow outline, the yellow forming the letters [...] "MK". The club was concurrently compelled to stop using a Womble for its mascot after {{the owners of the}} Wombles brand refused to renew the relevant licence agreement in protest against the move to Milton Keynes. Tottenham Hotspur, Charlton Athletic and Luton Town scheduled pre-season friendly matches against Wimbledon F.C., but then cancelled them in quick succession after each set of supporters protested. Koppel accused the WISA of orchestrating a campaign against the club, and said the Tottenham and Charlton friendlies had been cancelled in part because of concerns that the National Hockey Stadium might not be ready on time (Luton would have been an away match). It was widely speculated that Wimbledon F.C. would be [...] "renamed, 'rebranded' even" [...] after moving, with [...] "MK Dons" [...] reported in the press as a possible new name, but Koppel denied this. [...] "It remains Wimbledon Football Club. That is <b>our</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> the tradition of the club," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|HMS Belfast, a Town class cruiser, was {{launched}} in 1938 and served throughout the Second World War, participating in the December 1943 Battle of North Cape and firing {{some of the first}} shots of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the Korean War. Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve Belfast as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971 Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, Shirley Williams, as 'a unique demonstration of an important phase of <b>our</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> technology'.

As Andy Paull noted, [...] "It was the duty of the more responsible Indians to see that the history and traditions of our race were properly handed down to posterity. [...] A knowledge of <b>our</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> legends was similar as an education is regarded among whitemen. [...] Those who possessed it were regarded as aristocrats. [...] Those who were indifferent, whether adults or children, were rascals.

2500|$|With most of {{the album}} being revamped, other musicians joined the project, {{including}} Midi Mafia, RedOne, Toby Gad, Frank Ocean, and Brian Kennedy, the latter of which was consulted to replace Cox as the album's executive producer. Together, they crafted a bunch of new songs, including [...] "Freedom", [...] "One Thing" [...] and [...] "Today" [...] which Norwood later described as sounding [...] "more true to the sound" [...] that she had initially envisioned for the album. However, in early 2008, her A manager, Brandon Creed, presented Norwood several demo tracks that were produced by Rodney Jerkins, including [...] "Right Here (Departed)". Her former main producer on previous albums such as Never Say Never (1998) and Full Moon (2002), Jerkins hadn't worked with Norwood since 2002, due to conflicting schedules and a disagreement on her decision to work with Timbaland on Afrodisiac in 2003. Again, the album was reconstructed, with Jerkins taking over executive duties. On her decision to collaborate with Jerkins, Norwood commented: [...] "With Rodney being the person who produced , I, of course, wanted to go from there because of <b>our</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> all the music we have made in the past. It felt like {{the right thing to}} do [...] I wanted to see where that chemistry would take us creatively this time round." [...] With Jerkins on board, providing the bulk of Human, the sound of the album shifted drastically, with Norwood and her team abandoning most R records in favour of his international pop sounds.|$|E
