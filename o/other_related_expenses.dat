50|$|FORESCOM (Empresa Comunitaria de Servicios del Bosque) was {{established}} in 2003 as a private company from the same community organizations that together comprise ACOFOP. The origins of FORESCOM stem {{from the idea of}} reducing the costs of marketing, forest management, certification, infrastructure development and maintenance and <b>other</b> <b>related</b> <b>expenses</b> required for the operations of concessions by creating “blocks” of forest with neighboring communities. As CONAP matures as an independent government institution, the more that international assistance has been fleeing the RBM and affecting the funding for many of the NGO’s that were committed to the communities to provide the needed technical assistance and entrepreneurial expertise for the proper management of the forest leading to the financial burden of conservation to fall more and more on the communities. CONAP has readjusted some regulations {{to make it possible for}} communities to choose certified forest agents to fulfill the would-be roles of NGO’s. Many of these agents have already been contracted by FORESCOM, but FORESCOM is also becoming one of these certified forest agents to be able to provide these services itself. Estimates have been made that upon completion of certification, FORESCOM will create a 20% reduction in the cost of audits and recertification required every five years. Additionally, USAID donated $300,000 to develop road infrastructure leading to and within concession areas for more environmentally friendly transport of products. Besides providing marketing, accounting and financial planning services, FORESCOM is also considering expanding their capacities to include processing of wood materials to meet the demands of an international market for dry and semi-processed wood and to add value to the products coming out of the concessions. Due to its close ties with ACOFOP, the Forest Stewardship Council, the certifying body of forest agents, will have to oversee concerns for corruption and quality deterioration. Although the certification from the FSC doesn’t add value or open markets to concession products, it does help the community forestry framework maintain a “green image” by indicating strict rules for forest management.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to investigate}} the jobrelated expenditures of married clerical workers. Also examined were the economic contribution married clerical workers made to the total family income and their reasons for working. The sample was taken from the 1973 - 74 Staff Directory at Oregon State University. Only those employed in a clerical position who indicated they were married were included in the sample. Of the 425 who were mailed a questionnaire, 212 or 50 percent of them were received and were usable in the study. The number of hours the married clerical workers were employed per week ranged from 20 hours to 45 hours with 84 percent of the sample working 35 or more hours weekly. The mean monthly and yearly income for those in the sample were 471 and 5, 652 respectively. The mean percentage of gross family income contributed by the married clerical workers ranged from 10 percent to 94 percent with a mean of 47 percent. Of the 212 in the sample, 206 married clerical workers gave sufficient information to compute their job-related expenditures. Married clerical workers in the study reported 42. 1 percent of their gross monthly income was used for job-related expenditures. The mean expenditures were 198. 66 monthly and 2, 383. 92 yearly. Payroll deductions took 27. 2 percent of the married clerical workers' gross monthly income and <b>other</b> directly <b>related</b> <b>expenses</b> took 2. 2 percent. <b>Expenses</b> indirectly <b>related</b> to employment, such as clothing, personal care, child care, meals eaten away from home, and transportation, used 12. 7 percent of their gross monthly income. <b>Expenses</b> directly <b>related</b> to employment represented 70 percent of all job-related expenditures. The mean job-related expenditures of 124 of the 206 married clerical workers who reported no chiLdren in the household were 38 percent of their gross monthly and yearly income. Their mean gross monthly income was 478 and mean yearly income was 5, 736. <b>Expenses</b> directly <b>related</b> to employment took 29. 4 percent of their gross monthly and yearly income while indirectly <b>related</b> <b>expenses</b> used 8. 6 percent of their gross income. The mean percentage of job-related expenditures of the 42 married clerical workers who reported children in the household but no child care expense was 40. 7 percent with a mean monthly income of 459 and a mean yearly income of 5, 508. Payroll deductions represented 28. 3 percent of the job-related expenditures while <b>other</b> directly <b>related</b> <b>expenses</b> took two percent of their gross monthly and yearly income. <b>Expenses</b> indirectly <b>related</b> to employment used 10. 4 percent of their income. For the 40 married clerical workers who reported children in the household and child care expenses, their job-related expenses used 52 percent of their gross monthly and yearly income. Their mean monthly income was 498 and mean yearly income was 5, 976. Payroll deductions took 25. 9 percent of gross monthly income and <b>other</b> directly <b>related</b> <b>expenses</b> took 2. 9 percent. <b>Expenses</b> indirectly <b>related</b> to employment used 23. 2 percent of the married clerical workers' income. Reasons for working were also examined. Using a chi square test, there was a significantly greater amount (at the. 01 level) of full-time married clerical workers who indicated they worked to pay for current living expenses and to help pay debts than those working part time. There was also a significantly greater amount (at the. 05 level) of those who worked part time than those who worked full time indicating they worked because they liked working better than fulltime homemaking...|$|R
5000|$|Missionaries are {{expected}} to pay their own expenses while on the mission, often with assistance from family. In the past, each missionary paid his or her actual living expenses, but this approach created a disproportionate burden on missionaries who were assigned to more expensive areas of the world. In 1990, a new program was introduced to equalize the financial responsibility for each missionary {{and his or her}} family. Now, all young missionaries pay a flat monthly rate which is then redistributed according to regional costs of living. The cost of a mission varies based on the country of origin of the missionary; for missionaries from the United States, the cost is US$400 per month. The monthly rate helps to cover food, lodging, transportation, and <b>other</b> mission <b>related</b> <b>expenses.</b> Missionaries are asked to bring extra personal money for any personal items they would like to purchase. Once the money is received by the church it is then redistributed to the missionaries in amounts proportionate to the cost of living within the assigned mission area. [...] As families now contribute to a general fund for missionary expenses, the sum is deductible under many nations' tax policies regarding charitable gifts.|$|R
5000|$|... "I’m {{also asked}} {{how do we}} {{consider}} a nominee for the Merlin Award? A magician must send to the IMS World Headquarters a videotape or DVD of his complete act for our Board of Directors to consider. (No promo DVD’s or online videos are accepted.) The other question I am asked is “Are there any costs to receive the Merlin Award?” First, I must say that the Merlin Award is not for sale at any cost. Regarding the actual out-of-pocket cost, this varies from situation to situation. There are three ways a magician can receive the Merlin Award. One is to attend our Merlin Award banquet dinner; this is by invitation only, after the recipient was voted to receive the Merlin Award. Two is to participate and win a Merlin Award competition in different countries, which is organized by IMS with the event and convention organizers. And three {{is for us to}} travel to the magician’s country and present the Merlin Award to them in their own country. So let’s look at the cost of the first scenario, which is where the magician must obtain a visa from the American embassy to travel to the USA. He must purchase airline tickets, other travel related costs and fees, hotels, meals, and $500 US dollars per plate at the Merlin Award banquet dinner. In the second scenario, again the magician must travel to the event where the Merlin Award competition is taking place. He pays all of the same travel expenses as mentioned in the first scenario and pays for the entrance fee to the convention or to the competition, whichever applies. In the third scenario, where we have to travel from the USA to the magician’s country, either the magician or the magician’s producer pays for all of the travel expenses, hotels, meals, airlines, and <b>other</b> <b>related</b> <b>expenses.</b> Within any of these three scenarios, it’s always a trade {{when it comes to the}} cost. Within any of the three scenarios, our main focus is to generate as much PR as possible with the general public. A good example of this is when we were going to present the Merlin Award to Louis Yan in Hong Kong, we could have presented the award to him in our Hong Kong IMS office. Or we could have had our IMS members meet at a nice Chinese restaurant and present the award to him there. Then we came up with an idea. We approached one of the largest shopping malls in Hong Kong. Not only did they build a custom stage and provided enough seating for the audience, they also provided guards for crowd control. The mall management, with their media contacts, were able to invite newspapers, radio, and television to cover the event. Both the mall and Louis Yan received tremendous PR and public awareness."
