40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> of <b>onions</b> is a {{transmissible}} virus disease, of {{the mosaic}} group. The virus overwinters in the infected onion bulbs and in volunteer onion plants that live over {{winter in the}} fields. It probably is neither seed nor soil borne. <b>Yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> symptoms are characterized by yellowing and crinkling of the leaves, which become more or less flat and droop over in the advanced stages. Flower stalks of infected mother on ion plants become yellow, twist, and curl and are shorter than normal plants. Masking of <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> symptoms occurs quite commonly in infected onion plants, and these plants {{are a source of}} inoculum for infecting healthy plants; bulbs from the plants masking symptoms when regrown produce infected plants that show disease symptoms. Plants grown from infected onion sets and those that become infected early in the growing season produce under-developed bulbs of little commercial value. Onion plants having masked infection throughout their growth period produce apparently normal plants and yields. Infected mother onion plants produce normal seed, but the seed yield is about 30 percent less than from healthy plants. <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dwarf</b> is transmissible by artificial inoculation and insect vectors. By artificial inoculations the incubation period is usually about 10 days. Onion bulbs hypodermically inoculated with juice extracted from the fleshy and dry scale leaves of infected onion bulbs failed to show infection. Inoculations made during retarded growth periods either fail to infect the plants or the symptoms are not manifested during the current growth period. Signs of the disease appear when the bulbs of such infected plants are regrown. The virus extracted from <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> infected <b>onion</b> leaves that mask the symptoms is infective. <b>Yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus was transmitted under controlled conditions by the bean aphid (Aphis rumiscis Linn.), corn leaf aphid (Aphis maidis Fitch.), and the apple grain aphid (Rhopalosiphum prunifoliae Fitch). The <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus was inactivated when the viriferous juice was stored in vitro at 29 ° C. for a period of 112 hours. When infected onion leaves were stored in the open, at 29 ° C. for 100 hours, juice extracted from the leaves was non-infective. The infectivity of the virus was only slightly retarded when viriferous juice was heated 10 minutes at 70 ° C. At 75 ° C. for 10 minutes, 55 percent of the original virulence of the virus was lost. At 80 ° C. for 10 minutes, the virus was inactivated. With 10 -minute exposures the critical thermal point for the <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus lies between 75 and 80 ° C. Exposures as low as - 14 ° C. for 6 hours failed to inactivate <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus. Inoculations with dilutions of 1 - 10, 240 and above failed to infect any of the <b>onion</b> plants. <b>Yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus inoculated into Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) bulbs, Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) bulbs and shallots (Allium sativum L.) visibly infected 60, 30 and 90 percent of the plants, respectively. Inoculations with other plant viruses, including mosaic of Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) and Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) failed to infect onion plants. Only one (Riverside Sweet Spanish) of thirty-six onion varieties tested seemed to be markedly resistant. The combined effect of indexing all growing stocks of onion bulbs, producing the planting stock of bulbs in areas free from <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> and roguing out the infected volunteer onions in the fields reduced the percentage of <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> infection in the district from 40 percent in 1928 to a trace in 1933 and 1934...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is a host {{to several}} viruses, most {{commonly}} those belong-ing to the Allexivirus, Carlavirus, or Potyvirus genera. Nine species distributed among these three genera {{have been reported}} in Brazil: two species within carlaviruses, two within potyviruses, and five within allexiviruses. To quantify the prevalence of these viruses, young leaves from 520 plants (plants either symptomatic or asymptomatic) were collected from commercial fields grown in four Brazilian states and analyzed using universal and species-specific primers via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Potyvirus presence was positive in 306 samples (81 %), 151 of them (38 %) in mixed infections with other viruses. The most fre-quent potyviruses were <b>Onion</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus (OYDV, 56 %) and Leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV, 55 %). 187 samples (49 %) were positive for allexivirus, with 33 (9 %) showing single infections and 154 (41 %) showing mixed infections with Garlic virus A (GarV-A), Garlic virus B (GarV-B), Garlic virus C (GarV-C), Garlic virus D (GarV-D), and species belonging to the Carlavirus and Potyvirus genera. The predominant species in which allexiviruses were found were GarV-A and GarV-D. Only 15 samples (4 %) were infected solely by a carlavirus, and 63 (17 %) showed mixed infections with viruses from different genera. The dominant species of carlavirus was Garlic com-mom latent virus (GarCLV).

O alho (Allium sativum L.) é a segunda espécie mais importante deste género tanto pelo seu uso na dieta humana, como pelas suas propriedades terapêuticas. Um dos principais problemas que afectam a produtividades desta cultura e a qualidade do bolbo são as doenças virais sistémicas. Associações de vírus pertencentes aos géneros Potyvirus – <b>Onion</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus e Leek yellow stripe virus - e Carlavirus – Garlic common latent virus e Shallot latent virus – são responsáveis pela doença designada por mosaico do alho.

Com o objectivo de estabelecer uma metodologia de cultura {{in vitro}} a partir de material clonal de populações de A. sativum que proporcionasse uma elevada multiplicação de plantas isentas de infecções virais, testaram-se duas técnicas de cultura de tecidos - a cultura de meristemas e a cultura de discos basais - associadas a dois tratamentos antivirais - a termoterapia e/ou a quimioterapia. O material propagativo para o estabelecimento da cultura in vitro de A. sativum foi sujeito a temperaturas de 37 ou 45 °C e à presença ou ausência da ribavirina. O efeito dos tratamentos foi avaliado no desenvolvimento das plantas regeneradas e através de bioensaio usando extractos isolados destas plantas em espécies indicadoras específicas para as principais estirpes virais de A. sativum – alho-porro (Allium porrum L.) e alface (Lactuca sativa L.). A termoterapia e/ou a quimioterapia associada à cultura de tecidos, na generalidade, demonstraram ter influência sobre o número de plantas regeneradas e sobre o desenvolvimento das plantas em cultura in vitro, dependendo do genótipo da cultivar, entre outros factores. O diagnóstico das folhas recolhidas das plantas obtidas pela cultura in vitro foi realizado por microscopia electrónica de transmissão, sendo que, devido à morfologia isométrica, as partículas virais da espécie TSWV, quando presentes, foram as de mais fácil detecção. Widely distributed, the genus Allium {{has always had}} a great economic significance. This genus contains hundreds of distinct species but garlic (Allium sativum L.) is the second most important due to its therapeutic properties and its use in the human diet. Several factors adversely affect the productivity of A. sativum and the quality of its bulbs, but the main problems are consequence of viral systemic diseases. A virus complex consisting of two Potyviruses, <b>Onion</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>dwarf</b> virus and Leek yellow stripe virus, and two Carlaviruses, Garlic common latent virus and Shallot latent virus, is responsible for the disease designated as mosaic disease of garlic. This viral complex makes it difficult to separate and determine single virus species in the plant. Another virus infecting Allium crop is the Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). This Tospovirus was first detected in tomato in the 1920 s. Two different techniques of tissues culture have been used with the single purpose of establishing an in vitro culture from clonal material of A. sativum populations with high multiplication rates of regenerated healthy material - the meristem culture and the stem disc culture – both associated to thermotherapy and chemotherapy. The propagation material for the establishment of the in vitro culture of the A. sativum was subject to temperatures of 37 ºC or 45 ºC and to {{the presence or absence of}} ribavirin. The effects of the treatment were evaluated through the analysis of the development of the regenerated plants and by a bioassay using isolated extracts of these plants in indicator species for the A. sativum most common virus species – leek (Allium porrum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Thermotherapy and/or chemotherapy associated to the tissue culture have demonstrated to have an influence in the number of regenerated plants and in the development of the plants cultivated in vitro, depending on cultivar genotype among other facts. The leaves collected from the plants grown in vitro were diagnosed using a transmission electron microscope bearing in mind that due to the isometric morphology, the TSWV viral particles were easier to detect...|$|E
