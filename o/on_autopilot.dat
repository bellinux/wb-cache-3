Derived from the cancelled Advanced Strategic Air-Launched Missile developed by Martin Marietta for the United States Air Force, the missile utilised a Marquardt hybrid rocket-ramjet propulsion system, with a solid rocket booster providing initial thrust, with the rocket's chamber, following burnout, becoming the combustion chamber for a ramjet sustainer. The AQM-127 was designed to fly at speeds of Mach 2.5 at an altitude of , following a pre-programmed course <b>on</b> <b>autopilot.</b> The SLAT was to be fitted with radar signature augmentors and a radar seeker emulator; initial operational capability was projected for 1991.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown <b>on</b> <b>autopilot</b> with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E

The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was <b>on</b> <b>autopilot)</b> to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower.

Modern autopilots use an inertial navigation system, GPS, magnetometers and barometers {{to estimate the}} orientation, position, and velocity of the aircraft. In order to make correct decisions the <b>autopilot</b> must rely <b>on</b> correct information from the sensors. Fault diagnosis {{can be used to}} detect possible faults in the technical system when they occur. One way to perform fault diagnosis is model based diagnosis, where observations of the system are compared with a mathematical model of the system. Model based diagnosis is a common technique in many technical applications since it does not require any additional hardware. Another way to perform fault diagnosis is hardware diagnosis, which can be performed if there exists hardware redundancy, i. e. a set of identical sensors measuring the same quantity in the system. The main contribution of this master thesis is a model based diagnosis system for a fixed wing UAV autopilot. The diagnosis system can detect faults in all sensors <b>on</b> the <b>autopilot</b> and isolate faults in vital sensors as the GPS, magnetometer, and barometers. This thesis also provides a hardware diagnosis system based on the redundancy obtained with three <b>autopilots</b> <b>on</b> a single airframe.

[...] Michael Rechtshaffen writing in The Hollywood Reporter said Hellboy II was an uncompromised vision of del Toro's imagination. He said that with the director given free rein, the film came across as an amalgam of the best moments from his previous films, only with better visual effects. John Anderson of Variety wrote of a rococo precision to the visuals that exceeded that of the first film. He cited del Toro's [...] "clockmaker's preoccupation with detail" [...] and ability to blend state-of-the-art technology with more classical visuals as the reasons for the film's success. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the plot did not often deviate from its comic-book traditions, but that del Toro staged the action [...] "brilliantly". He said that while the visual effects deserved recognition, what made the film so exciting was the personality they were imbued with. Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice said that del Toro was <b>on</b> <b>autopilot,</b> but that he and his Pan's Labyrinth crew, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro in particular, staged the steady stream of action set-pieces expertly. Mike Goodridge of Screen International wrote that del Toro had retained the B movie tone of the first film, saying the film managed to avoid the self-importance of The Incredible Hulk and the Batman film series and that del Toro was simply a [...] "great storyteller" [...] providing a [...] "good time".
