5|$|The clutch was {{described}} as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large size, this led to proposals that the solitaire was K-selected, which means it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed crèches, that may have followed foraging adults as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> process. A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Knowledge {{acquisition}} and maintenance in medical domains {{with a large}} application domain ontology is a difficult task. To reduce knowledge elicitation costs, semiautomatic learning methods {{can be used to}} support the domain specialists. They are usually not only interested in <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> knowledge: <b>the</b> understandability and interpretability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> models is <b>of</b> prime importance as well. Then, often simple models are more favorable than complex ones. Methods and Material: We propose diagnostic scores as a promising approach for <b>the</b> representation <b>of</b> simple diagnostic knowledge, and present a method for inductive learning of diagnostic scores. It can be incrementally refined by including background knowledge. We present complexity measures for determining <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> scores. Results: We give an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presented approach using a case base from the fielded system SONOCONSULT. We further discuss that the user can easily balance between accuracy and complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> knowledge applying <b>the</b> presented measures. Conclusions: We argue that semi-automatic learning methods can support the domain specialist efficiently when building (diagnostic) knowledge systems from scratch. The presented complexity measures allow for an intuitive assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> patterns. Key words: diagnostic scores, knowledge discovery, complexity measures, data mining...|$|R
