5|$|The Preservation Society {{celebrated its}} 50th anniversary in 2001, {{and as part}} of the year of {{celebrations}} a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included {{the construction of a new}} two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking <b>office.</b> <b>Work</b> began on the first phase of the project in January 2002.

25|$|According to the constitution, {{the state}} {{language}} of Ukraine is Ukrainian. Russian is widely spoken, especially in {{eastern and southern}} Ukraine. According to the 2001 census, 67.5percent of the population declared Ukrainian as their native language and 29.6percent declared Russian. Most native Ukrainian speakers know Russian as a second language.
