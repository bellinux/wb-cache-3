Moreover, a woman can stipulate in her marriage contract that her husband may not take a second wife, and a first wife must consent to the second. The first wife may also petition for divorce if the husband takes another wife.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to surgical crown lengthening is orthodontic forced eruption, it is non-invasive, does not remove or damage {{the bone and}} can be cost effective. The tooth is extruded a couple of millimeters with simple bracketing of adjacent teeth and using light forces this will <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> couple of months. A fiberotomy is performed after crown lengthening and is easily performed by the general dentist. In many cases {{such as this one}} shown, surgery and extraction may be avoided if patient is treated orthodontically rather than periodontally.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins with}} the player's {{character}} driving through the Strangetown desert, presumably 'Road to Nowhere' in their car, when suddenly a flying green diamond (Also known as the Plumbob, the marker and logo of the Sims game) flies towards the player and causes them to lose control of, and damage, their car. Fortunately, the player finds a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage. At that point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player {{how to talk to}} NPC Sims, informs the player their car will <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> short while to fix.|$|E

25|$|Termites are detritivores and {{therefore}} do not exhibit pursuit behaviors, however ants and wasps {{can be highly}} predatory and are known to pursue prey in groups. For example, termite-hunting ants of the genus Pachycondyla, also known as Matabele ants, form raiding parties consisting of ants of different castes, such as soldier ants and worker ants. Soldier ants are much larger than worker ants, with more powerful mandibles and more robust exoskeletons, and so they make up {{the front lines of}} raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The ants do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the ants have a steady stream of prey.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr–Sommerfeld {{model was}} {{fundamentally}} inconsistent {{and led to}} many paradoxes. The magnetic quantum number measured the tilt of the orbital plane relative to the xy-plane, and it could <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few discrete values. This contradicted the obvious fact that an atom could be turned {{this way and that}} relative to the coordinates without restriction. The Sommerfeld quantization can be performed in different canonical coordinates and sometimes gives different answers. The incorporation of radiation corrections was difficult, because it required finding action-angle coordinates for a combined radiation/atom system, which is difficult when the radiation is allowed to escape. The whole theory did not extend to non-integrable motions, which meant that many systems could not be treated even in principle. In the end, the model was replaced by the modern quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom, which was first given by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925, using Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. The current picture of the hydrogen atom is based on the atomic orbitals of wave mechanics which Erwin Schrödinger developed in 1926.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the need}} for secrecy during the two months of filming, all {{candidates}} are made to sign a confidentiality agreement which prohibits all, but a few confidants nominated by them, to be told of where they will be during that time, which remains active after filming until the series has started broadcast, with all {{contact with the outside world}} restricted to a high level; each candidate gets a limited phone call once a week, and all have no access to newspapers, television or internet, while any electronic communication equipment they have (i.e. mobiles) is handed in before they begin. In addition, all candidates are made to remain in their accommodation throughout filming except when they must head out for a task, and can <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> day off if they are supervised by a chaperone from the production crew. As a result, the persistent presence of the cameras, the closeness of rivals in the competition and the lack of contact with families & friends, can cause considerable pressure and stress for a candidate between entering the process, to leaving it.|$|E

500|$|Word classes {{also carry}} out differing {{functions}} in grammar. Prototypically, verbs {{are used to}} construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates.

Some verbs such as [...] "curse" [...] can take two arguments, e.g. [...] "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called transitive.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} that the 21st Brigade arrived back in Australia, it was heavily depleted, with only 44 per cent of its {{authorised}} strength. The 2/14th subsequently underwent a period of rebuilding around Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in preparation for further operations. During this time the units of the 7th Division were converted to the [...] "jungle" [...] divisional establishment, which saw a reduction in the 2/14th Battalion's authorised strength to just over 800 men. As the battalion was brought back up to strength, in July there was a change of command. On 5 July, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner, who had previously commanded the 39th Battalion during the fighting on the Kokoda Track, replaced Challen as commanding officer. In August, {{along with the rest of}} the 21st Brigade the battalion moved to Port Moresby where it undertook training for the next month in preparation for the Salamaua–Lae campaign. However, the battalion was destined to <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> limited role in the campaign, and on 15 September it was dispatched to the airfields at Nadzab to relieve the US Army's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment and defend the vital airfields from possible Japanese attack.|$|E

500|$|Their later games would <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{few months}} each, in comparison. They {{abandoned}} {{the use of}} design documents after Dinowaurs, and instead chose to refine and experiment in process. Intuition released Effing Hail and Gray around April 2009. Players in action game Effing Hail control hail and wind to destroy the most buildings and midair objects within a time limit. The game was published through Kongregate. In Gray, players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in the crowd. The game was featured at IndieCade in 2009. In the case of Fig. 8., Wohlwend thought of the idea based on a college art project. In the project, Wohlwend followed a bike trail in the snow, metaphorically related it to the tribulations of romantic relationship, and made an art installation involving a bike spray-painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on the floor. The concept went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea, whereupon Boxleiter added game mechanics to the visuals. In their next game, Liferaft, the player-character is a young woman set to escape [...] "a post-apocalyptic sci-fi ... test chamber", with core gameplay that revolves around a [...] "Bionic Commando-style grappling hook". Wohlwend used a 16-bit era graphics style. They sought crowdfunding from Kickstarter, but later canceled and put the project on hiatus in October 2009.|$|E
500|$|... is a suicidal {{forbidden}} Sealing Jutsu {{where the}} user summons an entity called the [...] behind him, thrusting its arm through the user's stomach {{to grab the}} soul of the target and drag it into the user's body. Once the sealing is completed, the Reaper would consume the souls of both the user and the sealed, sentencing them to be locked in combat within the Reaper's stomach for all eternity. However, in cases where only part of the target's soul is sealed, the corresponding body part is paralyzed and suffers from extremely painful necrosis. The Fourth and Third Hokage executed the Reaper Death Seal during their respective battles with Kurama and Orochimaru. In both cases, both Hokage were forced to <b>only</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> part of their opponents down with them: Minato taking the Yin aspect of Kurama while Hiruzen is forced take the part of Orochimaru's soul within his arms in an attempt to ensure his former pupil would never perform a jutsu again. Later, in the Part II during the events of the Fourth Great Ninja War, Orochimaru uses an Uzumaki clan mask to summon the Reaper in a risky move, and breaks the Reaper Death Seal by cutting the demon's stomach wide open. With the Reaper Death Seal undone, the souls of the previous four Hokage are reanimated while Orochimaru regains the part of his soul he had lost years earlier.|$|E
