5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>to</b> emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford.

On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> single carriageway.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> {{strike a}} decisive blow {{back at the}} Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX and the leadership of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong Catalan Company {{in the spring and}} summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> New York in 1904.|$|E

Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E
5|$|The French {{proposal}} {{was met with}} strong opposition from governing bodies representing the other Gordon Bennett nations, and at the instigation of Germany {{a meeting of the}} bodies was organised to settle the dispute. Although the delegates rejected the French model for the 1905 race, to avoid deadlock they agreed to use the new system of limits for the 1906 race. But when Théry and Richard-Brasier won again in 1905, and the responsibility for organising the 1906 race fell <b>once</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the ACF, the French ended the Gordon Bennett races and organised their own event as a replacement, the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2013–14 season, Hughton's second as manager, {{shortly before}} Norwich were relegated back to the Championship, Hughton was {{replaced}} by former Norwich player Neil Adams. After a mediocre first half of the 2014–15 season, Adams resigned and Hamilton Academical manager Alex Neil was appointed in January 2015; at 33 years old, he was the second youngest manager in the Football League. The appointment reinvigorated Norwich's season and after narrowly missing out on automatic promotion back to the Premier League, victory in the 2015 Championship playoff final secured an immediate return to the top division of English football. During the 2015-16 season, former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was appointed Chairman. At the end of that season, Norwich were relegated <b>once</b> <b>more,</b> <b>to</b> play season 2016/17 in the Football League Championship.
