It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>candidates</b> won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was acceptable to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of the secular authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to the secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>candidates,</b> others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} election, {{candidates}} for the Referendum Party stood in 547 constituencies, the most that any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>candidates</b> were in Northern Ireland. This was because Goldsmith had made an agreement with Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist Party {{that he would not}} field any candidates against them if their one MEP joined his Europe of Nations grouping in the European Parliament, something that ensured that the grouping remained large enough to retain its Parliamentary funding. It also avoided putting up candidates in constituencies where the leading candidate (65 of them Conservatives, 26 Labour and 2 Liberal Democrats) was considered sympathetic to the Referendum Party's call for a referendum. Goldsmith appeared to acknowledge that it was unlikely to win any of the contested seats, stating that the party's success would be [...] "judged solely by its total number of votes". The party officially launched its electoral campaign on 9 April 1997 at Newlyn in Cornwall, where Goldsmith sought to whip up Eurosceptic sentiment among fishermen who were angry with the restrictions imposed by EU fishing quotas.|$|E

[...] When asked if he agreed that McCain would be a better choice than Barack Obama, he responded that it was [...] "a mixed bag" [...] and that [...] "Senator Obama clearly is much better [...] civil liberties and privacy issues" [...] but that he [...] "would favor a more expansive federal spending policy."
