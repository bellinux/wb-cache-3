5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines. Also at their disposal were four large AIM-70/71 bottom mines mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submarines. Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried {{in place of the}} AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).|$|E

5|$|At 10p.m. on March 5, the Mexican {{artillery}} ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, {{the exhausted}} Texians soon {{fell into the}} first uninterrupted sleep {{many of them had}} since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Building for the 1975–76 {{campaign}} {{he signed}} Phil Boersma from Liverpool to replace Murdoch, but Boersma never settled {{at the club}} and was frequently injured. They finished in 13th place, {{and went on to}} win the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a 1–0 win over Fulham. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were soundly beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty box to neutralise the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted to sack Charlton in July 1976 after becoming increasingly concerned that he was overstepping his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made {{considerable}} compromises {{to military}} utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building {{and appears to}} have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials and sites, and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, {{may help explain why}} they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.|$|E
5|$|Norman stone keeps played both a {{military}} {{and a political}} role. Most of the keeps were physically extremely robust and, while they were not designed as an intended location for the final defence of a castle, they were often placed near weak points in the walls to provide supporting fire. Many keeps made compromises to purely military utility: Norwich Castle included elaborate blind arcading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, in a Roman style, and appears to had a ceremonial entrance route; The interior of the keep at Hedingham could have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from {{a military}} perspective. Similarly there has been extensive debate {{over the role of}} Orford Castle whose expensive, three-cornered design most closely echoes imperial Byzantine palaces and may have been intended by Henry II to be more symbolic than military in nature.|$|E
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under the tractor crane. The impact was such that the tractor crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E

5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider {{than in any other}} known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not protruding from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E

In this match, the participants fought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring to climb into the cage.

5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriages were moved {{from the center of}} the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb {{a great deal}} of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
