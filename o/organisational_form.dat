25|$|Bourne and Clowes' Primitive Methodism germinated in the Camp Meetings from 1807 onwards and its {{separate}} <b>organisational</b> <b>form</b> {{came about}} {{as a direct result}} of the Wesleyan circuit authorities' reaction to these Meetings. Camp Meetings were all day, open-air gatherings for Christian preaching and group prayer, usually followed by a Love Feast. They were based on evangelical revival meetings in America. The first such meeting in England was held on Sunday 31 May 1807, between 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., in a field at School Farm, Mow Cop, about a quarter of a mile south west of Mow Cop Folly (a mock castle ruins built in 1754). Mow Cop, on the Staffordshire – Cheshire border, was a bleak spot lying as it does on a limestone ridge rising to 1,091 feet above sea level. Nevertheless, during the afternoon, the Camp still managed to draw a crowd of up to 4,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Over the 20th century, {{companies}} in the UK became the dominant <b>organisational</b> <b>form</b> of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the Companies Act 1948, ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority vote. In 1977, the government's Bullock Report proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening across Europe, exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted. Although making directors more accountable to employees was delayed, the Cork Report led to stiffer sanctions in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against directors who negligently ran companies at a loss. Through the 1990s the focus in corporate governance turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position from the chair, and remuneration committees {{as an attempt to}} place some check on excessive executive pay. These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the UK Corporate Governance Code, have been complemented by principles based regulation of institutional investors' activity in company affairs. At the same time, the UK's integration in the European Union meant a steadily growing body of EU Company Law Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to {{the failures of the}} dominant agro-food regime multiple practices for transition towards more environmentally and socially sustainable food systems have been proposed and put into practice by Alternative Food Networks (AFNs). To advance societal transitions, some AFNs have employed a strategy of developing broader networks. These network of networks, take various forms. To date, the ways in which networks of AFNs organise remains understudied, yet how they organise is likely to influence the transition pathways they advance. Drawing on organisation theory we propose a typology of <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> for networks of AFNs. We theorise that networks of AFNS that adopt <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> that are isomorphic to the dominant food regime may have their practices adopted, but that these risk co-option and dilution. Networks of AFNs that organise around polymorphic <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> are less likely to see their practices integrated at the dominant regime level, but their practices could have a more fundamental transformative impact. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of tacit knowledge in organisational learning and innovation {{has become the}} focus of considerable attention in the recent literature. Our {{understanding of the nature of}} the links between tacit knowledge and organisational learning, however, has been hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework integrating micro-level learning activities with <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> and macro-level societal institutions. This paper seeks to achieve such an integrative task. It argues that there is an interactive relationship between dominant knowledge types and <b>organisational</b> <b>forms.</b> Further, the extent to which tacit knowledge constitutes the knowledge base of the firm, and how it is formed and used are powerfully shaped by the broader institutional context. The paper develops a four-fold typology, at the cognitive, organisational and societal levels, as an analytical framework to explain the links between knowledge types, <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> and societal institutions. It shows how the three levels interact to shape the learning and innovative capabilities of firms. The theory developed in this paper represents the first attempt to integrate the diverse strands of literature and different levels of analysis into a single coherent framework...|$|R

50|$|The {{police forces}} of England and Wales have their origins in constabularies (bodies of constables). Legislation existed to appoint constables, but often did not direct how such bodies should operate and what <b>organisational</b> <b>form</b> they should take. The Police Act 1964 {{standardised}} arrangements through establishing wider geographical police forces, which merged many constabularies. The Police Act 1964 gave direction on the <b>organisational</b> <b>form</b> of police forces, {{the appointment of}} officers and disciplinary matters; {{in the broadest sense}} it provided a statutory governance framework. The Act established the 'tripartite' model of policing, which formed police authorities. This established a three-way balance of power between the Authority's Chairman, the Chief Constable and the Home Secretary. This arrangement varied within London for the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police.|$|E

40|$|Among some {{scholars}} of management, organisation and also economists {{as well as}} policy makers {{it is argued that}} certain new forms of firm organisation such as flexible and learning organisations increasingly are becoming “best practice”, in an increasingly learning and global economy. On a policy level, in eg. Denmark and OECD, questions are already asked as to how policies should be set up to stimulate such <b>organisational</b> <b>forms.</b> A crucial aspect that is recognised by {{some scholars}}, is that it is in certain competitive structures where flexible and learning organisations are well suited, though tends to be overlooked within the debate. The analysis in this paper applies performance data from Statistics Denmark merged with survey data of <b>organisational</b> <b>forms,</b> management, work practices and employee skills collected through a questionnaire in 1900 Danish firms in manufacturing as well as services. Applying regression analyses we show that the flexible or learning <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> {{in some parts of the}} economy, characterised by innovation turbulence and cumulativeness, are best performers though not in general. We argue that a quantitative analysis as ours is vital to both avoid idiosyncratic generalisations among scholars as well as policy makers, and to give rigid an...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{addresses}} {{the implications of}} accounting and hybrids {{for the management of}} risk. We argue firstly and most generally for a definition of hybrids that extends beyond <b>organisational</b> <b>forms.</b> The existing literature, we suggest, has been too focused on <b>organisational</b> <b>forms,</b> and has largely neglected the hybrid practices, processes and expertises that make possible lateral information flows and coordination across the boundaries of organisations, firms, and groups of experts or professionals. Secondly, we argue that the management of organisations is rapidly being transformed into and formalised around the management of risk, while much of the management of uncertainty occurs through a variety of hybrids that reside beyond the formalised practices of risk management. Thirdly, we argue that accounting practices are central to these issues, in so far as accounting is constantly engaged in a dual hybridisation process, seeking to make visible and calculable the hybrids that it encounters, {{while at the same time}} hybridising itself through encounters with a range of other disciplines. We address these issues in three main stages. The first section considers the ‘discovery’ of hybrid <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> by researchers on management and organisations over the course of more than two decades. The second section examines the ways in which economists, lawyers and other social scientists have considered the issue of hybrids. Here, the preoccupation with hybrid <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> largely continues, with its attendant neglect of hybrid practices, processes and expertises. The third section considers the discovery of a wider range of hybrids by researchers in accounting, and examines two specific arenas in which the hybridising of accounting expertise has been central: the microprocessor industry, and the various encounters between medical and financial expertise in the context of the ‘New Public Management’ reforms. The essay concludes with a discussion of the implications of this broader definition of hybrids for accounting and the management of risk...|$|R

Using this method, we compare the performance of <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> (M-form and U-form) in implementing changes such as innovation and reform. In our framework, <b>organisational</b> <b>forms</b> affect the information structure of an organisation and thus the way to coordinate changes. Compared to the U-form, the M-form organisation achieves better coordination but suffers from fewer economies of scale. The distinctive advantage of the M-form is flexibility of experimentation, which allows the organisation to introduce more innovation and reform. The theory {{is illustrated by the}} organisational differences between China and the former Soviet Union and sheds light on their different reform strategies, particularly with regard to the prevalence of the experimental approach in China.
