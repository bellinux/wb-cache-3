25|$|When {{the time}} for balloting arrives, the electors choose one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in {{nomination}} of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate {{for president of the}} political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. In New Jersey, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in North Carolina, the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.|$|E
25|$|However, {{what both}} Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says should be taken with a big pinch of salt.

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E
25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E

500|$|The bunkers were {{constructed}} of concrete, steel and iron and ranged {{in size from}} one- or two-person pillboxes with gun slits to large underground nuclear bomb shelters intended {{for use by the}} Party leadership and bureaucrats.
