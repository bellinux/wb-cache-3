Recently, there has been increased emphasis on quantification of digital images to calculate, for example, left ventricular volume or tumor radiation absorbed dose. In this paper, we consider specifically what improvements {{can be made in}} emission computed tomography simply by employing a window which is offset to the high-energy side of the photopeak {{in order to reduce the}} contribution of Compton scattered gamma-rays. The window is offset so as to reduce the count rate for a source in air by 20 %. Two lucite phantoms were measured. One was a short cylinder filled with a uniformly-distributed solution of 99 mTc in water. The other was a head phantom with a 0. 6 cm 3 "tumor" containing 99 mTc. Water surrounding the tumor could be nonradioactive or contain a dilute background activity. Absolute calibration was accomplished by imaging the simulated tumor in the air-filled phantom. With the <b>offset</b> <b>window,</b> calculated tumor activity is only 3 % and 7 % high without and with background respectively compared to 20 % and 26 % high with the symmetric window. However, total activity of the entire slice is still 37 % high even without background. For the cylinder containing uniform activity, the error in specific activity drops from 30 % to 18 % with the <b>offset</b> <b>window.</b> Therefore, an asymmetric window significantly improves quantification, and for certain cases such as an isolated tumor, may be sufficiently accurate without further correction...|$|E

40|$|Speech coding {{algorithms}} {{have different}} dimensions of performance. Among them, speech quality and average bit rate {{are the most}} important performance aspects. The purpose of the research is to improve the speech quality within the constraint of a low bit rate. Most of the low bit rate speech coders employ linear predictive coding (LPC) that models the short-term spectral information as an all-pole filter. The filter coefficients are called linear predictive (LP) coefficients. The LP coefficients are obtained from standard linear prediction analysis, based on blocks of input samples. In transition segments, a large variation in energy and spectral characteristics can occur in a short time interval. Therefore, there will be a large change in the LP coefficients in consecutive blocks. Abrupt changes in the LP parameters in adjacent blocks can introduce clicks in the reconstructed speech. Interpolation of the filter coefficients results in a smooth variation of the interpolated coefficients as a function of time. Thus, the interpolation of the LP coefficients in the adjacent blocks provides improved quality of the synthetic speech without using additional information for transmission. The research focuses on developing algorithms for interpolating the linear predictive coefficients with different representations (LSF, RC, LAR, AC). The LP analysis has been simulated; and its performance has been compared by changing the parameters (LP order, frame length, window <b>offset,</b> <b>window</b> length). Experiments have been performed on the subframe length and the choice of representation of LP coefficients for interpolation. Simulation results indicate that speech quality can be improved by energy weighted interpolation technique...|$|E
40|$|A three-component shallow {{reflection}} seismic {{line from}} Springbank, Alberta demonstrates large amplitude, surface wave noise {{due to the}} use of a surface energy source. Changes in phase velocity versus frequency, referred to as dispersion, of surface waves is primarily dependent on the shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the wave channels. Shear wave refraction first breaks are picked from the radial or in-line shear wave shot records. These picks are inverted with for near-surface shear wave lithology. This enabled a dispersion model to be calculated which is used to identify and interpret surface wave noise on the shot record. By summing the _o-p wavefleld transform of the vertical and radial component on a shot consistent basis the dispersion curve can be observed directly. The change in phase velocity with frequency can be approximated by a linear frequency modulated (LFM) wave over the frequency bandwidth of the Rayleigh waves. An offset varying compression operator is cross-correlated with each trace in the shot _gather before multi-channel filtering to remove linear dispersion. This reduces dispersed surface waves to a single aliased dip which is more easily removed by the 2 -D median f-k filter. The output is then uncompressed by flipping the operator in time and again cross-correlating. This hybrid multichannel filter is applied to a synthetic shot record contaminated with LFM noise at a bandwidth of 8 - 30 hz with velocity bounds of 230 - 800 m/s. The f-k domain representation of the synthetic shot record has a single focused dip of 520 m/s after LFM compression. This enables better removal of dispersive noise by the multichannel filters such as the velocity f-k or median f-k. This new filter is applied to the real three-component data set. The results indicate {{that the best way to}} minimize surface wave noise in shallow reflection studies is through careful choice of the acquisition parameters to ensure the target events are within the optimum <b>offset</b> <b>window.</b> In this example, the ground roll filtering is unable to recover the underlying reflection signals within the surface wave noise. The best CDP stack obtained for the P-wave data is due to an inside or near offset mute to completely remove the Rayleigh waves from the shot records before stacking. 6...|$|E

50|$|In signal processing, {{operations}} are chosen to improve {{some aspect of}} quality of a signal by exploiting {{the differences between the}} signal and the corrupting influences. When the signal is a sinusoid corrupted by additive random noise, spectral analysis distributes the signal and noise components differently, often making it easier to detect the signal's presence or measure certain characteristics, such as amplitude and frequency. Effectively, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is improved by distributing the noise uniformly, while concentrating most of the sinusoid's energy around one frequency. Processing gain is a term often used to describe an SNR improvement. The processing gain of spectral analysis depends on the window function, both its noise bandwidth (B) and its potential scalloping loss.

40|$|The clock offset {{between a}} GPS-based NTP time server and NTP time client software, {{installed}} in the MS Windows Operating System (OS) and the Linux OS on PCs, are measured and evaluated. The clock <b>offset</b> on MS <b>Windows</b> 98 OS shows a trend {{with a range of}} about 55 ms. The NTP time client software on MS Windows OS adjusts the internal clock with the Application Program Interface (API) timer function. The resolution of the API timer function depends on the hardware interrupt of the PC system timer, which is 54. 9 ms of IRQ 0 for MS Windows 98 OS. Thus, this range of the trend in the clock offset is considered to be caused by the resolution of API timer function. The clock <b>offset</b> on MS <b>Windows</b> XP OS shows time resolutions of 1 ms for the 1 ms API timer mode and 10 ms for the 10 ms API timer mode. The resolution of 1 ms is dependent on a hardware interrupt of IRQ 8 (976 μs) that is generated by a PC real-time clock. The resolution of the system timer on MS-windows XP depends on the hardware platform and shows 10 ms or 15 ms. The clock offset on Linux OS also has a trend as well as a periodic divergence. The trend interval of the drift is estimated to be about 35 minutes. The origin of this trend in interval is presumed to be the loop constant of the kernel Phase Lock Loop (PLL). The Standard Deviation of this clock offset for 24 hours is 0. 95 ms. Evidently, both MS Windows OS and Linux OS adopt different algorithms for keeping the internal clock. The accuracy of time synchronization by NTP is restricted by the algorithms. The limitation of the time synchronization accuracy on MS Windows OS is related to the resolution of API that depends on a hardware interrupt generated in the PC hardware system timer and real-time clock. On the other hand, the loop constant of the kernel clock algorithm restricts the time synchronization accuracy by NTP on Linux OS. I...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{identification}} of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) near injection sites {{is difficult because}} of scattered gamma rays. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the optimal energy windows for elimination of scattered gamma rays in order to improve the detection of SLNs. Methods: The clinical study group consisted of 56 female patients with breast cancer. While the energy was centred at 140 keV with a 20 % window for Tc- 99 m, this energy window was divided into five subwindows with every 4 % in planar imaging. Regions of interest were placed on SLNs and the background, and contrast was calculated using a standard equation. The confidence levels of interpretations were evaluated using a five-grade scale. Results: The contrast provided by 145. 6 keV ± 2 % was the best, followed by 140 keV ± 2 %, 151. 2 keV ± 2 %, 134. 4 keV ± 2 % and 128. 8 keV ± 2 % in that order. When 128. 8 keV ± 2 % and 134. 4 keV ± 2 % were eliminated from 140 keV ± 10 % (145. 6 keV ± 6 %), the contrast of SLNs improved significantly. The confidence levels of interpretation and detection rate provided by the planar images with 140 keV ± 10 % were 4. 74 ± 0. 58 and 94. 8 %, respectively, and those provided by 145. 6 keV ± 6 % were 4. 94 ± 0. 20 and 100 %. Conclusion: Because lower energy windows contain many scattered gamma rays, upper <b>offset</b> energy <b>windows,</b> which exclude lower energy windows, improve the image contrast of SLNs near injection sites.

40|$|Abstract The {{ensemble}} correlation {{approach to}} PIV processing relies on averaging the correlation planes of many images before performing a peak search and subsequent {{estimation of the}} average displacement. Generally this processing method has found wide-spread use {{for the analysis of}} sparsely seeded micro-PIV image data and can achieve resolution at the single pixel level if the number of images is sufficiently large. The article investigates the potential of the ensemble correlation approach for macroscopic applications driven by two primary motivations: (1) to increase processing speed for the retrieval of mean and fluctuating components, and (2) to provide an estimator to aid in the processing of the individual frames at a later stage. The ensemble correlation algorithm, implemented as a coarse-to-fine grid refinement approach with adaptive sampling <b>window</b> <b>offset,</b> provides mean velocity data at least one order of magnitude faster than the conventional frame-by-frame PIV interrogation schemes and shows rapid convergence and minimal deviation from averaged data obtained by conventional PIV. Estimates of the fluctuation terms (RMS-values) are derived using a modified peak detection and fitting algorithm based on least squares fitting an elliptically shaped Gaussian distribution. The method is demonstrated on PIV recordings obtained from a subsonic free air jet and compared to results obtained by conventional (pair-by-pair) PIV processing.

Judges would announce their verdicts {{out of the front}} window of the chamber, which would have then overlooked the Market Square.

In 1700 local magistrates considered converting the King's head into an overflow jail, but the sum of £400 for refurbishment was thought to be prohibitively expensive. The main feature of the room is the ceiling, which is the work of the Victorian architect George Devey who was commissioned by the Rothschild family in the 1880s to undertake changes to The King's Head. He was responsible for <b>offsetting</b> the front <b>window</b> to retain the view of the Market Square. He also remodelled the ceiling in a mock Tudor style using some of the original beams, but the black and white design is a Victorian idea of how Tudor buildings looked. Tudor rooms could, in fact, be quite colourful. The large medieval hearth was moved here from the Great Hall. It is etched with graffiti, possibly by Roundhead troops garrisoned here during the English Civil War.|$|R
40|$|TREC {{exercise}} we completed {{series of}} runs in 4 categories. The {{first was the}} mainline ad hoc retrieval task in which we repeated our entry for TREC- 5, without modification. This is based on applying various thresholds to processing a query including query term and posting list thresholds, {{in order to improve}} retrieval efficiency. As our previous work has shown, this can be done without any loss in retrieval effectiveness. Our second set of submitted runs were as part of the crosslingual retrieval track where we ran French topics against French texts, effectively mono-lingual retrieval. What is novel about our approach is that it is based upon matching word shape tokens derived from character shape codes, rather than matching word stems or base forms. This technique is useful for retrieving from scanned document images rather than full texts and is something we are currently refining for English texts (and English queries). With those other experiments we have obtained surprisingly effective retrieval and this venture in TREC- 6 was to see how effective WST-based retrieval could be for French. The third series of experiments we submitted were based on the high precision track in which we used a graphical representation of a ranked list of documents and the positional occurrences of search terms within those top-ranked documents, relative to each other. Our final experiments were as part of the spoken document retrieval track in which we removed the tags used for story bounds, turned transcripts and topics into a phonetic representation using a phoneme dictionary and we then retrieved story identifiers based on a triphone match between topic and fixed-width windows of triphones in the transcripts. We also applied a weighting function to triphones as they occurred in story “windows ” based on their <b>offset</b> within those <b>windows.</b> 1...|$|R
5000|$|Photographs of {{the first}} eight prototypes show a largely {{circular}} fuselage cross-section, especially forward of the wing root, with the A-0 series possessing flatter sides, dorsal and ventral surfaces of the main A-series production aircraft. The choice of {{what was called the}} [...] "Cabin 3" [...] cockpit design on 20 September 1939 for the production A-series run, placed a well-framed hemispherical [...] "fishbowl" [...] nose onto the He 177 A-0, giving it the generic [...] "stepless cockpit", without the separate windshield for the pilot and co-pilot, that beginning with Heinkel's own He 111P almost all German bomber aircraft had in World War II, and indeed had on all eight of the prototypes with the earlier [...] "bullet" [...] nose design. The forward glazing of the He 177A's [...] "stepless" [...] cockpit had each set of its characteristic framing members, of four supporting frame members per set running in each orthogonal direction, running as the parallels and meridians on a globe would. Two sets of four almost square windows, themselves arranged in a square of four windows each {{on each side of the}} upper cockpit, just behind the [...] "fishbowl's" [...] rear edge, provided sideways vision from the cockpit for the pilot and crew. Photographic evidence shows these side windows were produced with slight differences in external appearance between those built by Heinkel (with its primary headquarters, Heinkel-Nord plant near Rostock, and the satellite Heinkel-Süd plants around Vienna) and those built by Arado Flugzeugwerke, the only major subcontractor for the He 177A's airframes. Often, the two lower rows of the [...] "fishbowl's" [...] windows in the nose glazing were made opaque, with the exception of the bombardier's protruding bombsight <b>window</b> <b>offset</b> to starboard in the lower nose glazing, either by painting them over or replacing them with metal panels that performed the same function.|$|R
