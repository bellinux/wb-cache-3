Those plays advanced the Yellow Jackets to the Clemson 42-yard line, where Georgia Tech began advancing by small gains.

5|$|The pass at Thermopylae {{was thus}} {{opened to the}} Persian army, {{according}} to Herodotus, at {{the cost to the}} Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> days of battle. Herodotus says, at one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{sources on}} Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favourable light.

Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of Mauretania, Caligula's military actions in Britannia, and his feud with the Roman Senate.|$|E

5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing {{the same level of}} control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter in {{possession}} of the ball in Tennessee territory, attempting to capitalize upon a drive begun in the third quarter.

5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel).
