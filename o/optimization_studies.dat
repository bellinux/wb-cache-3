40|$|Field methods {{based on}} the finite-difference approximations of the time-domain Maxwell's {{equations}} and the potential-flow equation {{have been developed to}} solve the multidisciplinary problem of airfoil shaping for aerodynamic efficiency and low radar cross section (RCS). A parametric <b>study</b> and an <b>optimization</b> <b>study</b> employing the two analysis methods are presented to illustrate their combined capabilities. The parametric study shows that for frontal radar illumination, the RCS of an airfoil is independent of the chordwise location of maximum thickness but depends strongly on the maximum thickness, leading-edge radius, and leadingedge shape. In addition, this study shows that the RCS of an airfoil can be reduced without significant effects on its transonic aerodynamic efficiency by reducing the leading-edge radius and/or modifying the shape of the leading edge. The <b>optimization</b> <b>study</b> involves the minimization of wave drag for a non-lifting, symmetrical airfoil with constraints on the airfoil maximum thickness and monostatic RCS.

50|$|Biomarkers can be {{classified}} based on different parameters. They can {{be classified}} based on their characteristics such as imaging biomarkers (CT, PET, MRI) or molecular biomarkers.

Biomarkers can also be classified based on their application such as diagnostic biomarkers (i.e., cardiac troponin for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction), staging of disease biomarkers (i.e., brain natriuretic peptide for congestive heart failure), disease prognosis biomarkers (cancer biomarkers), and biomarkers for monitoring the clinical response to an intervention (HbAlc for antidiabetic treatment).

40|$|A great {{advantage}} of some neutron sources, such as accelerator-produced sources, {{is that they}} can be tuned to produce different spectra. Unfortunately, <b>optimization</b> <b>studies</b> are often time-consuming and difficult, as they require a lengthy Monte Carlo simulation for each source. When multiple characteristics, such as energy, angle, and spatial distribution of a neutron beam are allowed to vary, an overwhelming number of simulations may be required. Many <b>optimization</b> <b>studies,</b> therefore, suffer from a small number of datapoints, restrictive treatment conditions, or poor statistics. By scoring pertinent information from every particle tally in a Monte Carlo simulation, then applying appropriate source variable weight factors in a post-processing algorithm, a single simulation can be used to model any number of multiple sources. Through this method, the response to a new source can be modeled in minutes or seconds, rather than hours or days, allowing for the analysis of truly variable source conditions of much greater resolution than is normally possible when a new simulation must be run for each datapoint in a study. This method has been benchmarked and used to recreate <b>optimization</b> <b>studies</b> in {{a small fraction of the}} time spent in the original studies...|$|E
