40|$|Copaiba <b>oil-resin,</b> {{extracted}} from the trunk of Copaifera, and traditionally used in folk medicine {{in the treatment of}} various disorders, {{has been shown to be}} an effective antiinflamatory, antitumor, antitetanus, antiseptic and antiblenorrhagea agent. As, there are few studies evaluating its genotoxicity, this aspect of the commercial <b>oil-resin,</b> and its volatile and resinous fractions, were evaluated in mice by comet assay and micronucleus (MN) test. A single dose of oil resin, volatile or resin fractions (500; 1, 000 or 2, 000 mg/kg b. w.) was administered by gavage. The chemical compositions of Copaiba oil resin and its fractions was analyzed by gas chromatography. According to comet assaying, treatment with either one did not increase DNA damage, and as to MN testing, there was no alteration in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. Chromatographic analysis of the <b>oil-resin</b> itself revealed sesquiterpenes, diterpenic carboxylic acid methyl esters and high levels of &# 946;-caryophyllene.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: to evaluate, histologically and macroscopically, the {{influence}} of Copaifera multijuga (Copaíba) <b>oil-resin</b> on the healing process of cutaneous wounds, comparing it with nitrofurazone. Methods: we divided 36 rats into three groups of 12 animals, according to the treatment to be administered. Group SL (control) received saline on the lesion; the Group OIL received topical treatment with Copaíba oil; and the Group NITRO was treated with Nitrofurazone. We inflicted a circular wound of 8 mm in diameter {{on the back of}} each animal. We subdivided each of the three groups of 12 animals into three subgroups, according to treatment time and euthanasia (7, 14 and 21 days). All animals received the proposed treatment daily. We photographed the lesions for area measurement, as well as for evaluation of macroscopic aspects. We resected and stained the scars to quantify and qualify elastic fibers, collagen, degree of epithelization, neovascularization and inflammation. Results: although the saline solution provided a faster wound closure in its initial phase, after 14 days the wound size of the three groups tested was the same. Levels of inflammation and neovascularization were similar in all three groups. The amount of collagen and elastic fibers was higher in the Nitrofurazone and Copaíba oil groups. Conclusion: in male Wistar rats, Copaifera multijuga <b>oil-resin</b> positively influences the healing process, but it is less effective than nitrofurazone in healing by secondary intention...|$|E

Copaibas are trees that are native to tropics, with nine species found in Brazilian Amazonia. Copaiba trees produce an <b>oil-resin</b> that {{is found in}} secretory channels located in the trunks. Copaifera reticulata is the predominant species in the Tapaj?s National Forest. The socioeconomic aspects of the communities of Pedreira and S?o Domingos, who are authorized to collect copaiba, and the phytodemographic, genetic and physical-chemical aspects of the copaiba populations available to these communities were analyzed, {{with the objective of}} subsidizing future actions of copaiba management in the Tapaj?s Flona. In the socioeconomic study, semi-structured interviews with the communities extractors elucidated the current local situation with respect to the extraction of copaiba. In the phytodemographic study, the species was identified, the density of potentially productive individuals was quantified, and these were mapped. Microsatellite markers developed by Embrapa Genetic Resources and Biotechnology were used for the genetic analyses. The physical-chemical parameters used were density and viscosity of the <b>oil-resin,</b> as these are associated with potential uses and for the chemical study it was the refraction index, acidity, saponificacion and ?ster. The management of copaiba is technologically simple, but the extractors identified numerous difficulties, including less advantage in the sale of the <b>oil-resin</b> than formerly, showing that the situation in the past that stimulated them {{is very different from the}} current situation, especially in the commercialization process. The density of productive trees in the collection area of Km 67 was 5, 5 and of Km 72 was 6, 2, with 200 adult individuals geo-referenced. The largest number of productive trees was in the diameter class 51 - 70 cm, totaling 88 trees, and the largest diameter found was 120 cm. To C. reticulata it presents an <b>oil-resin</b> with viscosity 9 (mPa. s) very variable and it lowers acidity (mg of KOH/g), which could serve as a basis for <b>oil-resin</b> differentiation. With the six microsatellite loci that transferred, 78 alleles were observed. The genetic diversity (He) varied from 0. 59 to 0. 85 per locus, considered high for Neotropical tree species; however, the observed heterozygosity was smaller than the expected heterozygosity by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the collection areas, demonstrating a reasonable level of inbreeding (f = 0. 375 to 0. 419), probably due to a clumped distribution. The analysis with Structure did not identify two populations based on the collection areas, but two genetic groupings based on different combinations of alleles. Most of the genetic variation was found within the collection areas (97 %), with weak genetic differentiation among the areas (Fst = 0. 030). A little less genetic variation it was found within the genetic groups (93 %), with a corresponding increase in divergence (Fst = 0. 070). The noncorrespondence between collection areas and genetic groupings could be due to unknown historical events, but, combined with the high genetic diversity founds, suggests that the current levels of inbreeding won't be a problem for a management plan, although the isolation of the Tapaj?s Flona in the future could contribute to elevate inbreeding to worrying levels. The information presented here will serve as a baseline for future comparison, guiding improvements in the management plan...|$|E

The specimens were stored in these solutions during 90 days, being removed every 30 days for weighting. The solutions were renewed every 15 days. The results were subjected to statistical analysis by Dunn's and Mann-Whitney tests (a= 0. 05). The solubility of Poliquil was higher in STF (38. 4 ± 36. 0) than in DW (28. 4 ± 15. 0), while Biosealer showed higher solubility in DW (34. 61 ± 6. 0) than in STF (18. 59 ± 8. 0). The storage solution influenced the behavior of sealers {{in relation to the}} weight variation (p= 0. 0001). Poliquil presented higher variation of weight independent of the solution (p= 0. 239). Biosealer also presented higher variation of weight regardless of the solution (p= 0. 0001). The solubility of Biosealer was different from that of Poliquil, but both sealers showed low solubility in STF. Under the tested conditions, neither of the materials were according to the ADA'S specification...|$|E
40|$|The {{refractive}} indices (RI) of {{the eight}} samples of copaiba oils, collected for this study at RDS Tupé ranged from 1. 50284 to 1. 50786. The thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates of these oils revealed with anisaldehyde-sulphuric acid reagent showed dark lilac stains with several small stains at low Rf and a large rounded stain at high Rf. On the other hand, the twelve copaiba oils purchased at local markets presented RI between 1. 48176 and 1. 50886, and the TLC plates, showed as general profile blue stains, with smaller superimposed stains at low Rf, bigger superimposed stains like elongated stain at high Rf and a colorless rounded stain at middle Rf. Among 12 purchased oils at local markets, a) three oil-resins presented similar RI and TLC profile to those observed for collected copaiba oils; b) six oils showed same RI and TLC profiles to those observed for soybean oil; c) three samples presented RI near to those showed by copaiba <b>oil-resin,</b> however the TLC profile was near to profile observed for a prepared mixture soybean oil: copaiba oil, two samples with 3 : 1 proportion and one sample with 1 : 3 proportion. Therefore, the RI determination and the TLC profiles could be considered rapid and efficient procedures for detection of vegetal oil in the copaiba oil-resins...|$|E
40|$|Timber {{management}} directly {{influences the}} population dynamics of tree species, like Copaifera spp. (copaíba), which provide <b>oil-resin</b> with ecological and economic importance. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the structure and population dynamics of Copaifera in unmanaged and managed stands by reduced-impact logging (RIL) in eastern Amazon in Pará state, Brazil. Based on a stem map of the study area, 40 Copaifera trees were randomly selected, where an equal number of trees were selected in managed and unmanaged stands. A transect of 10 × 100 m was centered at each tree (50 m each side) to assess Copaifera regeneration. Transects were subdivided into ten plots, of which six were systematically chosen to assess the height, diameter and number of Copaifera seedlings and saplings. The field assessment occurred in 2011 and 2013. To estimate the amount of sunlight transmitted to the forest floor, we computed canopy cover from airborne LiDAR data. According to the results, the abundance of Copaifera seedlings/saplings was higher in managed than unmanaged stands. About 5 % of Copaifera regeneration was found between 45 – 50 m from the Copaifera tree while ~ 73 % of regeneration was concentrated within a 10 m radius of the Copaifera tree. We verified that the diameter distribution of Copaifera regeneration was not a negative exponential distribution, as is typical of most tree species in natural forest. Rather, the Copaifera regeneration had a spatially aggregated distribution. In this short-term analysis, the impact of timber management is not negatively affecting the population structure or dynamics of Copaifera regeneration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>oil-resin</b> of Copaiba (Copaifera duckei Dwyer), aired in vaginal cream on the reproductive performance of female rats (Rattus norvegicus). To determine the components of the C. duckei oleoresin, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (CG–MS) was used, and considering the trans-caryophyllene sesquiterpene as a phytochemical marker in the oleoresin. Due to the extensive use of copaiba oleoresin in the suppository form for gynecological infections, an evaluation was carried out on the effects of copaiba oleoresin (Copaifera duckei Dwyer), delivered in a vaginal cream, on the reproductive performance of female Wistar rats. For this purpose, three groups (n= 5 – 6 /group) of female rats were treated as follows: 1 – vaginal cream of copaiba oleoresin (28. 6 mg/kg), 2 – base vaginal cream and 3 – control (physiological saline 0. 9 %), administered intravaginally, for 30 days before pregnancy, and from day zero to day 20 during pregnancy. Laparotomy was performed on the 21 st day of pregnancy, followed by the determination of reproductive variables: number of live and dead fetuses, mass of the fetuses and placentas, number of implantations and resorptions, number of corpora lutea, pre- and post-implantation loss, and analyses of the fetuses with regard to external and internal anomalies and/or malformations (skeletal and visceral). The trans-caryophyllene present in the sample is suggested as a phytochemical marker and the results {{of this study}} demonstrate an absence of maternal toxicity and foetotoxicity embryofoetotoxicity at the dose administered, corresponding to ten times the recommended dose for use in humans. Accordingly, no significant statistical difference was observed between the treated and control groups, for the variables analyzed. Thus, it is concluded that the vaginal cream containing 2. 5 % copaiba oleoresin is safe during gestation, in female rats (Rattus norvegicus) of the Wistar strain...|$|E
40|$|Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. {{commonly}} known as "copaiba", produce a commercially valuable <b>oil-resin</b> that is extensively used in folk medicine for anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antiseptic purposes. We have found the hydroalcoholic extract of this plant leaf {{has the potential to}} treat urolithiasis, a problem affecting similar to 7 % of the population. To isolate the functional compounds C. langsdorffii leaves were dried, ground, and macerated in a hydroalcoholic solution 7 : 3 to produce a 16. 8 % crude extract after solvent elimination. Urolithiasis was induced by introduction of a calcium oxalate pellet (CaOx) into the bladders of adult male Wistar rats. The treated groups received the crude extract by oral gavage at 20 mg/kg body weight daily for 18 days. Extract treatment started 30 days after CaOx seed implantation. To monitor renal function sodium, potassium and creatinine concentrations were analyzed in urine and plasma, and were found to be in the normal range. Analyses of pH, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, oxalate and citrate levels were evaluated to determine whether the C. langsdorffii extract may function as a stone formation prevention agent. The HPLC analysis of the extract identified flavonoids quercitrin and afzelin as the major components. Animals treated with C. langsdorffii have increased levels of magnesium and decreased levels of uric acid in urinary excretions. Treated animals have a significant decrease in the mean number of calculi and a reduction in calculi mass. Calculi taken from extract treated animals were more brittle and fragile than calculi from untreated animals. Moreover, breaking calculi from untreated animals required twice the amount of pressure as calculi from treated animals (6. 90 +/- A 3. 45 vs. 3. 00 +/- A 1. 51). The extract is rich in flavonoid heterosides and other phenolic compounds. Therefore, we hypothesize this class of compounds might contribute significantly to the observed activity.

40|$|Fish oil {{has been}} proved to have health {{benefits}} for humans, but the utilization of fish oil for human consumption is very limited. A survey of 19 Indonesian fish oil producers showed that fish oil was produced from fish meal processing and fish canning. Most Indonesian fish oils, especially fish meal oil, were chemically, physically and organoleptically unacceptable. But, as they contain high levels of omega- 3 fatty acids, a refining process was required {{to improve the quality}} making the oil acceptable for human consumption. The resin refining process, a no heat process, was used to refine the crude oil. Fish <b>oil-resin</b> volume ratio affected the refined fish oil quality and ratio 1 : 1 was recommended. The refined oil quality could be further improved by multiple refmings, and this method was successfully applied to Indonesian fish meal oil having a strong undesirable odour. The refining rate could be accelerated by application of vacuum pressure to the column. The height of the column showed a significant effect on the refined fish oil quality, but the column diameter had no effect. Resin refining reduced the quantity of natural antioxidants and changed the proportion of volatile flavour compounds. Most Indonesian fish oil producers intend to adopt the resin refining process. Storage tests indicated that the refined oil deteriorated faster than unrefined oil. This trend was shown by both Indonesian and New Zealand oils. Ter-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) proved as the most effective antioxidant for fish oil, but this antioxidant is not listed as a permitted antioxidants for use in Indonesian foods. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), as the best alternative, is recommended. 0. 01 % BHA was sufficient to recover the loss of natural antioxidant during resin refining. Vacuum package was very effective in reducing the deterioration rate due to autoxidation. Canned fish was used as a mean of delivering fish oil to Indonesian consumer. The proposed product type was generated through supermarket, consumer and canned fish processor surveys. The survey results suggested that the fish oil to be disguised in a canned fish product using sardine as raw material, tomato sauce as medium and 155 g tall tube-can as the container. The most acceptable tomato sauce formula developed using mixture design is 18. 6 % tomato paste, 28. 0 % fish oil, 46. 6 % water, 3. 7 % salt and 3. 1 % sugar. The canned fish should be sterilized using vacuum head space-can at 1 2 l. l°C to obtain optimum protection of omega- 3 fatty acids. The experiment using the Plackett and Burman design showed that the canned fish product should involve pre-cooking, vacuum head space, garlic, shallots and vinegar additions. Sterilization time needed to be optimized. The optimization experiment indicated that 50 minutes was recommended to sterilize the canned fish with disguised fish oil. Sterility and incubation tests showed that sterilization at 1 2 l. l°C for 50 minutes was sufficient to produce safe product Consumer testing in five cities of Indonesia showed that only a minority of consumers did not like the developed product. Most of the consumers intend to buy the product, if the product is released to the market A survey of medical doctors supported the proposed product, as over 90 % of them were willing to suggest patients consume the product for nutritional purposes...|$|E
40|$|O Ãleo resina da Copaifera langsdorfii (ORCL), popularmente reputado como produto natural para o tratamento de afecÃÃes inflamatÃrias e para promover cicatrizaÃÃo de Ãlceras e de feridas Ã rico em Ãcido caurenÃico, um diterpeno com diversas propriedades farmacolÃgicas como antiinflamatÃria, antinociceptiva, diurÃtica, vasodilatadora e hipoglicemiante. AlÃm disso, apresentou genotoxicidade e, portanto os nÃveis do AK necessitam serem limitados em preparaÃÃes comerciais do ORCL. O presente trabalho pretende avaliar a seguranÃa do uso do AK utilizando testes de citotoxicidade in vitro, toxicidade aguda em camundongos, {{screening}} para aÃÃo no sistema nervoso central (SNC) in vivo e em eventos cardiovasculares, respiratÃrios e reprodutivos, in vivo e in vitro. Os testes de toxicidade foram realizados usando larvas de Artemia sp., eritrÃcitos de ratos e humano, linhagens tumorais, gametas e embriÃes de ouriÃo (L. variegatus). Para o estudo cardiovascular foram utilizados ECG e pressÃo arterial em rato anestesiado, coraÃÃo isolado perfundido (rato e cobaio), Ãtrios, leito mesentÃrico perfundido e preparaÃÃo de aorta de ratos in vitro. Os efeitos reprodutivos foram analisados na implantaÃÃo e na organogÃnese de embriÃes de camundongos. AK nÃo foi tÃxico para o SNC de acordo com os parÃmetros observados no teste do campo aberto e do rota rod. AK (atÃ 1 g/Kg) e nÃo induziu toxicidade nem atingiu a DL 50 em camundongos atÃ 72 h apÃs a sua administraÃÃo. AK Ã tÃxico para Artemia sp. (CL 50 2, 00 Â 0, 48 &# 61549;g/mL = 6, 6 &# 61549;M); hemolÃtico (CE 50 74 &# 61549;M - rato e 56 &# 61549;M - humano); manifesta aÃÃo antiproliferativa (AK 78 &# 61549;M) contra a MCF- 7 (inibiÃÃo de 95 %) e a HCT- 8 (inibiÃÃo de 45 %), embriotÃxico para ouriÃos (L. variegatus), na fertilizaÃÃo e nos estÃgios de blastocisto e larval (CI 50 84, 2 &# 61549;M, 44, 7 &# 61549;M e < 10 &# 61549;M, respectivamente). No ECG, nÃo houve alteraÃÃo no intervalo QT, porÃm induziu bradicardia com uma tendÃncia para o prolongamento do intervalo PR, e promoveu hipotensÃo no rato normotenso anestesiado (10 mg/Kg). No coraÃÃo perfundido in vitro, AK promoveu inotropismo negativo (1000 &# 61549;g; 59 %) parcialmente revertido pela adrenalina (300 ng). Inotropismo negativo similar foi evidenciado em cobaio (AK 300 &# 61549;g, 47 % e 1000 &# 61549;g, 50 %). Nos Ãtrios isolados, AK (1 - 1000 &# 61549;g/mL = 3 &# 61549;M - 3 mM) nÃo demonstrou uma mudanÃa nem na freqÃÃncia cardÃaca nem na forÃa da contraÃÃo. Em anel de aorta prÃ-contraÃdas por Phe (1 - 10 &# 61549;M), AK (1 - 300 &# 61549;g/mL = 3 &# 61549;M â 1 mM) nÃo mostrou efeito relaxante, mas quando prÃ-incubado (AK 50 &# 61549;g/mL = 160 &# 61549;M) causou inibiÃÃo significativa da contraÃÃo mÃxima na curva dose-resposta de Phe (10 - 12 a 3 X 10 - 5 M). AK (atÃ 50 mg/Kg) nÃo apresentou atividade estrogÃnica ou antiestrogÃnica sobre ratas impÃberes. Na embriogÃnese de camundongos, AK reduziu o ganho de peso das grÃvidas (AK 25 mg/Kg) sem afetar sua performance reprodutiva, o que ocorreu com AK 50 mg/Kg (perdas embrionÃrias de 83 %). Durante a organogÃnese houve reduÃÃo do ganho de peso materno, do ganho de peso fetal e placental e retardo na ossificaÃÃo dos fetos (AK 25 mg/Kg), que progrediu atÃ a perda significativa das gestaÃÃes (AK 50 mg/Kg). Conclui-se que AK, nas doses testadas, mostrou-se seguro para animais com relaÃÃo Ã toxicidade aguda e para os sistemas da Bateria Central de estudos de SeguranÃa FarmacolÃgica, porÃm apresentou toxicidade significativa nos eventos relacionados Ãs cÃlulas mitÃticas ou Ã diferenciaÃÃo celular e nos reprodutivos (estudos suplementares), provavelmente devido aos seus efeitos antiproliferativos e antiinflamatÃrios. Portanto, necessita-se cautela no uso do Ãleo-resina de copaÃba durante a gestaÃÃo. CopaÃba <b>oil-resin</b> from Copaifera langsdorfii is {{a popular}} natural health product used {{for the treatment of}} sore throat, urinary and pulmonary affections, and to promote healing of ulcers and wounds. The <b>oil-resin</b> contains various terpenoid components including kaurenoic acid (KA), a principal diterpenoid that manifests anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, diuretic, vasodilator and hypoglycemic effects. Besides, KA at higher concentrations demonstrates genotoxicity in the tests of Comet and Micronucleus in vitro. Because of this genotoxic potential, it needs to be restrained the concentration of KA in commercial preparations of copaiba oil. The present work therefore aims to assess the safety of KA through cytotoxicity and acute toxicity tests, studying the effects on central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, respiratory and reproductive systems in vivo and in vitro. The toxicity tests were performed using Brine shrimp (Artemia sp.) larvae, rat and human erythrocytes, tumor cell lines, and sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus) gametes and embryos. In the study of cardiovascular effects, KA was examined on rat ECG and blood pressure, rat or guinea pig isolated perfused heart, atria, aorta, and on rat mesenteric perfusion. The reproductive effects of KA were examined on implantation and organogenesis in mice. The results obtained from the open field and rota rod tests did not reveal any apparent toxicity of KA to the CNS. The KA up to an oral dose of 1 g/kg in mice produced no measurable toxicity and the 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) through a 72 h oral toxicity study could not be established. On the other hand, KA showed a very high toxicity to Artemia sp. (LC 50 2. 00 Â 0. 48 &# 61549;g/mL = 6, 6 &# 61549;M); hemolytic activity (EC 50 of 74 &# 61549;M and 56 &# 61549;M on rat and human RBCs, respectively); manifested antiproliferative effects (78 &# 61549;M) against MCF- 7 (95 % inhibition) and HCT- 8 (45 % inhibition); embryotoxicity to L. variegates, impaired the fertilization and development of blastula and larval stages with an IC 50 of 84. 2 &# 61549;M, 44. 7 &# 61549;M and < 10 &# 61549;M, respectively). On ECG, there was no significant alteration in the QT interval but did produce bradycardia and showed a tendency to prolong the PR interval. KA (10 mg/Kg) induced a hypotensive response in anesthetized normotensive rats. On perfused rat heart, KA at 1000 &# 61549;g showed a negative inotropic effect (59 %) partially reverted by adrenaline (300 ng). A similar negative inotropism was evidenced in guinea pig heart (KA 300 &# 61549;g, 47 % and 1000 &# 61549;g, 50 %). In isolated atrium, KA (1 - 1000 &# 61549;g/mL = 3 &# 61549;M â 3 mM) demonstrated neither bradycardia nor a change in cardiac contractile force. In aortic rings pre-contracted by phenylephrine (1 - 10 &# 61549;M), KA (1 - 300 &# 61549;g/mL = 3 &# 61549;M - 1 mM) failed to produce a relaxant effect but, however, pre-incubation with KA (50 &# 61549;g/mL = 160 &# 61549;M) significantly inhibited the maximal contraction induced by phenylephrine as evidenced by a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve. KA, at oral doses up to 50 mg/Kg was found to be free from estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects in mice. Nevertheless, 50 mg/Kg treatment with KA promoted heavy embryonic loss, and at 25 mg/Kg, although it caused no such impairment but significantly affected the maternal weight gain during pregnancy. During the organogenesis phase, a reduction in maternal, fetal and placental weight gains was observed. Besides, KA treatment groups showed markedly delayed fetal ossifications (25 mg/Kg) and an adverse pregnancy outcome (50 mg/Kg). In conclusion, the data obtained from in vivo experimentation suggest that KA, at the doses tested, is apparently safe and free from undesirable effects in all the studied organ systems (core battery of safety pharmacology studies) except the reproductive one (supplemental studies), where in its antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory actions may possibly contribute to impaired pregnancy outcome. Therefore, a caution needs to be exercised in the use of copaiba oil resin during pregnancy...|$|E
