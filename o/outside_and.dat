Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E

5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the <b>outside.</b> <b>And</b> I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E

However, by 11  years after thinning it was greater in both plots than that before thinning. No difference in species richness was observed between within <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> the “MM” <b>and</b> “LD” exclosures at 11  years after thinning.

They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|In the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the walls is God's House tower. This is architecturally important as {{it was one of}} the first urban buildings to be built to hold gunpowder artillery – in this respect, it closely resembles Cow Tower in Norwich. The tower was built alongside God's House Gate and is three storeys high. The gunports designed for handcannon can be seen on the <b>outside,</b> <b>and</b> the roof was designed to hold larger cannon. Adjacent to the tower is God's House Gate, a two-storey building also equipped with a gun-port.|$|E

When SpongeBob bursts {{through the front door}} and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along.

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the labour market <b>and</b> immigrants from <b>outside</b> Europe <b>and</b> OECD countries living in Sweden. We investigated two main questions; the first was; what accounts for higher unemployment rates among immigrants from <b>outside</b> Europe <b>and</b> OECD countries in Sweden? And the second, what accounts for lower wages and earnings of immigrants from <b>outside</b> Europe <b>and</b> OECD countries in Sweden. We collected data by reviewing secondary sources of research on labour market statistics, recruitment process of some companies, earnings of heterogeneous immigrants and natives living in Sweden. We analyzed our data with human capital theory, disparate treatment theory and unconscious bias theory. Our findings were that, stereotypical discrimination by employers was the cause for higher unemployment rate among immigrants from <b>outside</b> Europe <b>and</b> OECD countries and perceived low skills by employers was the cause for lower earnings among immigrants from <b>outside</b> Europe <b>and</b> the OECD countries...|$|R
