5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a hot blast, {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E

Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Occasionally, gumbo is served {{as part of a larger}} menu.|$|E

500|$|At {{some time}} in the mid-1940s, {{probably}} in summer 1945, Sibelius and Aino together burned a large number of the composer's manuscripts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove</b> in the dining room at Ainola. There is no record of what was burned; while most commentators assume that the Eighth Symphony was among the works destroyed, Kilpeläinen observes that there had been at least two manuscripts of the work—the original and Voigt's copy—as well as sketches and fragments of earlier versions. It is possible, says Kilpeläinen, that Sibelius may not have burned them all. Aino, who found the process very painful, recalled later that the burning appeared to ease Sibelius's mind: [...] "After this, my husband appeared calmer and his attitude was more optimistic. It was a happy time". The most optimistic interpretation of his action, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer’s music critic David Patrick Stearns, is that he got rid of old drafts of the symphony to clear his mind for a fresh start. In 1947, after visiting Ainola, the conductor Nils-Eric Fougstedt claimed to have seen a copy of the Eighth on the shelf, with separate choral parts. The musicologist Erkki Salmenhaara posits the idea of two burnings: that of 1945 which destroyed early material, and another after Sibelius finally recognised that he could never complete the work to his satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{obsession}} which dominated both {{his life and}} his South London home, once described in a colour supplement interview as the den of [...] "a boy who had run away from home" [...] and never returned. A reliable figure was never established for the size of his collection, but its scale constrained movement throughout the house and extended into every room, even the kitchen: [...] "There are comics <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> on the fridge, on the floor. Denis Gifford can still use his grill, but roasts are a memory for he can no longer open his oven. The fridge filled up years ago, for Denis is fascinated by the free gifts that come with some comics... There are lollipops in the fridge now, and Desperate Dan nougat." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{three of}} Hughes, Hurston, and Thurman enjoyed the shock value of {{referring}} {{to themselves as}} the Niggerati. [...] Hurston's biographer Valerie Boyd described it as [...] "an inspired moniker that was simultaneously self-mocking and self-glorifying, and sure to shock the stuffy black bourgeoisie". [...] Hurston was actually the coiner of the name. [...] The quickest wit in what was a very witty group, which encompassed Helene Johnson, Countee Cullen, Augusta Savage, Dorothy West (then a teacher), Harold Jackman, and John P. Davis (a law student at the time), as well as hangers-on, friends, and acquaintances, Hurston dubbed herself the [...] "Queen of the Niggerati". [...] In addition to Niggerati Manor, the rooming house at 267 West 136th Street where both Thurman and Hughes lived, Niggerati meetings were held at Hurston's apartment, with a pot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove,</b> into which attendees were expected to contribute ingredients for stew.

2500|$|Industrialization {{also caused}} social changes. The new factory working {{class in the}} cities was housed under {{generally}} poor conditions. Whole families lived in small one or two-room apartments in tenement buildings up to six stories high, badly aired and with insufficient lighting. Sometimes, they shared apartments with [...] "night sleepers", unmarried men who paid for a bed at night. The kitchen in such an apartment was often used as a living and sleeping room, and even as a bathroom. Water had to be fetched from wells and heated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> Water pipes were laid only {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, and then often only with one tap per building or per story. Brick-and-mortar stoves fired with coal remained the norm until well into the second half of the century. Pots and kitchenware were typically stored on open shelves, and parts of the room could be separated from the rest using simple curtains.|$|E
2500|$|Mar Karyakos is {{a ruined}} monastery located about a {{kilometer}} east of Bakhdida, and lies amid agricultural fields. The monastery {{consists of three}} caves that are carved naturally in a hilly rock formed geologically of hardened pebbles. In the middle cave, which is the largest, stands an altar formed of piled stones. Every year on theSunday before Palm Sunday believers visit the altar and light its candles,in addition to giving prayers to the needy people of Bakhdida. Afterwards, the families picnic in the fields that surround the monastery and eat a treat made from wheat known as [...] "kitikelie". The wheat is washed, soaked in salt water for three days, and then dried in the direct sunlight. After it is completely dry the grains are roasted in a special pan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stove.</b> Melon seeds are also washed, salted, dried and roasted {{the same way as}} the wheat and then mixed with it.|$|E
