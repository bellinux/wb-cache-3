25|$|The early 1980s of the State League and Brisbane {{competitions}} were {{dominated by}} the relatively young Mt Gravatt club (established in 1960), winning four (and runners-up in the other) of the first five premierships <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>decade.</b> With {{the ending of the}} State League in 1982, the QSF restructured the Brisbane men's senior competition, renaming the top tier as the 'Premier' division for 1983.

25|$|The Saints {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>decade,</b> winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the wooden spoon in 2000. They did not fare well in 2001 or 2002 either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as Justin Koschitzke, Nick Riewoldt, Nick Dal Santo and Brendon Goddard, who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end. They scored a notable five-point victory over the eventual three-time premiers Brisbane in Round 11.|$|E

25|$|Increasing {{insurance}} and fuel costs for owners coupled with looming Federal emissions and safety regulations would eventually {{put an end}} to the unrestricted, powerful engines of the 1960s. Safety, luxury and economy would become the new watch-words <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>decade.</b> Engine performance began declining in 1971 when GM issued a corporate edict mandating that all engines be capable of using lower-octane unleaded gasoline, which led to dramatic drops in compression ratios, along with performance and fuel economy. This, coupled with trying to build cars as plush as GM's more luxurious Buicks and Oldsmobiles, contributed to the start of a slow decline of Pontiac in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>decade</b> {{also saw a}} {{dramatic}} increase in display configurations being deployed, including widescreen canvases, multiple projections and video mapped onto the architectural form. This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications NTSC and PAL - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate video presentation have led to diversity and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i fixed format of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all.|$|E

The Lions club (as Queensland Roar FC), was then successful with their nomination (ahead of the Brisbane Strikers) for the inaugural national A-League competition, which commenced in the 2005-06 (Summer) season. The club changed its name to Brisbane Roar FC in 2009, when teams from the Gold Coast and Townsville were accepted into the A-League in 2009. The Brisbane Roar, despite drawing reasonable crowds, is yet to make serious inroads into the popularity enjoyed by the other football codes (in particular the Brisbane Broncos, Brisbane Lions and the Queensland Reds - see adjacent graph). With the departure of the Brisbane Lions club from the local league, Palm Beach (Gold Coast) and the Brisbane Strikers respectively dominated the following two seasons. Rochedale Rovers dominated the Premiership {{for the rest of the}} decade, sharing some silverware with Peninsula Power, Brisbane Wolves and others.|$|E

500|$|During the 1890s, Elgar {{gradually}} {{built up}} {{a reputation as a}} composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>decade</b> included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was [...] "very sick at heart over music" [...] and hoped {{to find a way to}} succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: [...] "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you.

The division of Negros island into two distinct provinces (Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental) took place in 1890 at the start <b>of</b> <b>this</b> historic <b>decade.</b> La Carlota as well saw a flowering <b>of</b> culture during <b>this</b> <b>decade,</b> which ushered in what many consider as its golden literary age.

In this approach the worker takes a central position in providing treatment, interventions are planned, group process is highly structured, and great emphasis is given to outcome evaluation and research (Vinter, 1967; Garvin, 1987; Galinsky & Schopler, 1974). Schwartz (1961) proposed his vision of the small group as an enterprise in mutual aid.|$|E
