5|$|The Bush {{campaign}} advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E
25|$|Smith earned 40% {{favorable}} and 20% unfavorable {{ratings in}} a December 2007 poll. Smith's office characterized {{the relatively low}} numbers as a reflection on Congress in general; a spokesman for Steve Novick's campaign (Novick lost to Merkley in the primary) suggested that the public was frustrated with elected officials and looking to outsiders to effect change, and Merkley's campaign highlighted Smith's shifts in position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, Barr hoped to portray {{himself as a}} {{conservative}} alternative to the Republican nominee John McCain. [...] He emphasized {{his opposition to the}} Republican Party for its positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the USA PATRIOT Act, but stood as an advocate for border security and fiscal constraint, demonstrated by his opposition to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The candidate never made headway in election polls, placing third or fourth when included. Barr's efforts to be invited to presidential debates with the two main candidates also fell short when he failed to meet the 15% polling threshold.|$|E

500|$|Thompson officially {{entered the}} race on April 1, 2007 {{following}} {{the announcement that}} he would seek the Republican Party's nomination for president during an interview on This Week with George Stephanopoulos. He branded himself as a reliant conservative whose campaign was [...] "looking good" [...] due to the base he was attempting to establish in Iowa. The state would hold the nation's first presidential caucus in January 2008. His entrance into the race slightly increased voter's recognition of [...] "Thompson" [...] in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson. He remained at 2% in presidential polls, in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24% {{in his home state}} of Wisconsin, which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states. [...] Upon his entrance, the candidate set forth his position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> holding that as president, he would allow Iraqis to vote on whether or not the United States military should remain in the nation. He stated that if the Iraqis [...] "don't want us there...we should get out." ...|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and {{his support}} for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the debate on October 30, 2007, in Philadelphia, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor, and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.|$|E

The New York Times reported that the loss made “Mr. Daschle the first Senate party leader in more than five decades to be voted out of office. The race had been closely watched by both parties, with White House officials calling the senator an obstructionist for opposing the president <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> tax cuts and judicial nominees. Senator Daschle had fought hard, raising $16 million during the campaign as of mid-October, which he spent largely on television advertisements.

2500|$|The {{comment was}} brought up again in an {{interview}} with Amy Goodman for Democracy Now! in 2006. In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West to meet with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaper heating oil for poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative. He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez, [...] "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush says, we're here to tell you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people support your revolution." [...] Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006. The comment ignited a great deal of controversy. Hillary Clinton refused to acknowledge Belafonte's presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them. AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: [...] "AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable." [...] During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte compared the American government to the hijackers of the September 11 attacks, saying: [...] "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?" [...] In response to criticism about his remarks Belafonte asked, [...] "What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? [...] By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." [...] When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Belafonte responded: [...] "Bring it on. Dissent is central to any democracy." ...|$|E
