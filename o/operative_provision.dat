5000|$|Case E-16/11 Icesave {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the landmark case of the EFTA Court case, mainly due to its relation to the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis and Directive 94/19/EC on deposit-guarantee schemes, which had also been transposed into EEA law. This directive obliged EU and EEA EFTA states to create deposit-guarantee schemes. Deposit-guarantee schemes reimburse a limited amount of deposits to depositors where their bank has failed, as a way to protect a part of depositors’ wealth from bank failures. In Icesave, the EFTA Court dealt with an action by the EFTA Surveillance Authority against Iceland. The Authority claimed that Iceland had violated the transposed Directive and thus EEA law in the aftermath of its major economic crisis and the collapse of the Icelandic banking sector in 2008, by failing to ensure that British and Dutch depositors using the ‘Icesave’ accounts offered by Icelandic banks received the minimum amount of compensation set out in Article 7(1) of the Directive. The Court noted that the nature of the result to be achieved fell to be determined by the substantive provisions of the particular directive. Moreover, it noted {{that as a result of}} the economic crisis, the regulatory framework of the financial system had been subject to revision and amendment in order to enhance financial stability. But the Court held that the Directive did not envisage the alleged obligation of result to ensure payment to depositors in the Dutch and British branches of Icelandic banks in a systemic crisis of the magnitude experienced in Iceland or how to proceed in a case where the guarantee scheme was unable to cope with its payment obligations remained largely unanswered by the Directive, with its Article 7(6) being the only <b>operative</b> <b>provision</b> that deals with non-payment. Still, the relevant question in Icesave was whether the EEA States are legally responsible under the Directive in an event of such magnitude. The Court held that the principle of non-discrimination requires that there to be no difference in treatment of depositors by the guarantee scheme itself and the way in which it uses its funds. Discrimination under the Directive is prohibited but the transfer of domestic deposits from some entities to new ones was made before the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority, Fjármálaeftirlitið, rendered its declaration that triggered the application of the Directive. Thus, depositor protection under the Directive never applied to depositors in Icelandic branches of the affected banks. Accordingly, the transfer of domestic deposits did not fall within the scope of the non-discrimination principle as stipulated by the Directive and could not lead to an infringement of the aforementioned provisions of the Directive read in light of Article 4 EEA.|$|E

40|$|Constitutional {{text and}} {{government}} action are at times discordant in important ways. This discrepancy occurs in both mature and emerging democracies. It {{can result in}} the underenforcement of constitutional norms and implicate the rule of law. When the constitutional norm involves the right to vote, the gap between constitutions and governance inevitably triggers concerns about democracy as well. There is rich and ample debate within American legal scholarship over {{the effect of the}} underenforcement of constitutional norms on the scope and meaning of the norm. The arguments generally fall into one of two camps. One strand of argument suggests that judicial underenforcement of a constitutional norm does not define the norm itself; nor does it absolve non-judicial actors from enforcing the full conceptual scope of the norm. That is, a constitution 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 <b>operative</b> <b>provisions</b> 2 ̆ 2 are the foreground where the norm is defined. A second branch of underenforcement scholarship suggests that judicial implementation defines constitutional norms by employing the 2 ̆ 2 implementing doctrine 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 decision rules 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 used to enforce some aspect of the norm. This Article aligns itself with the first branch of scholarship and borrows the 2 ̆ 2 <b>operative</b> <b>provisions</b> 2 ̆ 2 thesis to examine the right to vote when it exists as a constitutional norm in a maturing democracy. In particular, I extract two principles from the 2 ̆ 2 <b>operative</b> <b>provisions</b> 2 ̆ 2 thesis and employ them in the contexts of voting rights and comparative law to illustrate how and why underenforcement of a normative right to vote can occur in newer democracies. First, I adopt the position that the scope and meaning of a constitutional norm may be greater than its actual enforcement. Second, I rely on the argument that under- or nonenforcement results not only from a lack of judicial enforcement but also from underenforcement by the legislative and administrative actors that are obligated to enforce constitutional norms to their fullest extent. By employing these two principles, this Article analyzes an under-recognized underenforcement of the right to vote that has evaded the force {{of some of the most}} liberal contemporary constitutions. It also analyses the subsequent judicial enforcement of that norm as an integral step toward full enforcement of the fair measure of the right to vote. To illustrate this phenomenon and apply the theory of constitutional underenforcement to practice, I use Ghana, in West Africa—a recently designated 2 ̆ 2 maturing democracy 2 ̆ 2 —as a case study...|$|R

The author is not greatly concerned at this point with the procedure required before interceptions of noncitizens outside the country as under U.

Resignations were still only suspended, yet the prospects of compromise were hopeful. At a cabinet held on the following day (June 5) it was agreed that he should {{in the course of a}} week give notice of a bill to take the place of the expiring Crimes Act. The point left open was whether the <b>operative</b> <b>provisions</b> of such an Act—agreed on some time before—should not be brought into operation without some special act of the executive government, by proclamation, order in council, or otherwise.

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDKenya {{adopted a}} new Constitution in 2010, with {{devolution}} of political power, responsibilities {{and resources to}} newly created counties as its centrepiece and most transformative aspect. Devolution was intended to address the many governance, economic and development problems of the country, which arose from {{the long history of}} a highly centralised, undemocratic and inequitable system. The main problem, however, is how to give effect to the stated intent of the Kenyan people and make devolution as envisaged, a reality. This is {{compounded by the fact that}} devolution’s constitutional design has its provisions spread across and permeating the entire Constitution. Thus, the main aim of this thesis was to give a coherent and purposeful interpretation of the constitutional provisions on devolution in order to realise the objectives and intent of the Kenyan people. This study has advanced the argument that the central nature of devolution and its intended objectives can be realised through a purposive interpretation. This entails the practical realisation and application of the constitutional provisions by identifying the objects and purposes of devolution and giving effect to them. Such interpretation draws on textual, structural, contextual and historical elements. The Constitution is interpreted as a whole, taking into account both intra-textual and extra-textual context, including the social, economic, political and cultural context of the country in its historical and contemporary dimensions. Comparative law, especially the South African jurisprudence and scholarly commentaries, provided instructive lessons, given the significant textual similarities between the Kenyan and South African constitutional provisions on devolution. A coherent and purposive interpretation has demonstrated that devolution was adopted to promote and advance democracy and accountability; development and service delivery; equity and inclusiveness; and limitation of centralised power. This is reflected in the values, objects and principles of devolution, which are not only aids for the interpretation of other provisions of the Constitution but also themselves <b>operative</b> <b>provisions</b> demarcating the limits of powers of the two levels of government. The interpretation demonstrates that the Constitution creates two distinct governments that must conduct their intergovernmental relations in a cooperative manner. The county governments are relatively autonomous; are represented in selected decision-making at the national level, through the Senate; and have both exclusive and concurrent powers. Although they have limited revenue-raising powers comprising property rates and entertainment taxes, they are entitled to a share of the revenue raised nationally as equitable shares and conditional or unconditional additional grants. The national government, however, has some limited and circumscribed supervision powers. These conclusions have been arrived at by interpreting the devolution- and county-empowering provisions liberally, broadly and generously in favour of the counties and devolution, and the national government intervention and devolution limiting provisions narrowly and strictly against the national government. In this process, the South African case law has been very useful in giving content to the purposive interpretation...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), {{designed}} to provide protection from discrimination for the exercise of religion for incarcerated individuals and for those in need of various municipal permits or approvals in order to exercise their religion. With {{seven years of experience}} in the courts, this article examines the impact of RLUIPA on local governments across the country through an analysis of how the courts have been interpreting and applying statutory ambiguities and creating inconsistent doctrine in an effort to define terms and implement RLUIPA 2 ̆ 7 s protections. Whether an appropriate Solomon-like balance can be developed under the Act to clearly recognize compelling governmental interests in protecting the public health, safety and welfare through land use planning and various land use and local environmental controls remains elusive {{at this point in time}} and may depend upon the wisdom of the individual federal courts. Section II of this article explores the uncomfortable relationship of government with religion, and the manner in which this relationship has affected the genesis of the constitutional interpretations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. What constitutes the establishment of religion and whether RLUIPA aids government in the establishment of religion is beyond the scope of this article and will not be discussed in detail. Section II also examines the precursor to RLUIPA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), enacted by Congress in 1993 and ruled unconstitutional in 1997. Understanding Congressional motivation for the enactment of RFRA, as well as its constitutional deficiencies, sets the backdrop for the last part of the section, which discusses the Congressional development and enactment of RLUIPA, including why Congress chose land use as a primary focus of religious freedom. Section III briefly reviews the arguments surrounding the constitutionality of RLUIPA, and while not attempting to fully analyze this issue, the discussion is provided since some believe that the statute 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionality as it relates to the land use provisions may be vulnerable to further constitutional attack. Section IV discusses the <b>operative</b> <b>provisions</b> of RLUIPA, including both the substantial burden rule and the Act 2 ̆ 7 s nondiscrimination provisions. It explores how the courts have interpreted RLUIPA and its ambiguous terms, and discusses how various cases have been decided. Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees are also touched on. Section V argues why RLUIPA, as drafted, may not necessarily bode well for local governments and their historical use of the police powers to guide community planning and community development.
