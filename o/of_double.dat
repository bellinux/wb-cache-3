5|$|Besides the Original Chicken sandwich, Burger King {{has sold}} or sells several other {{sandwiches}} {{that are similar}} to the Specialty Sandwiches. Several burgers have been sold on this family of sandwiches, including a pair of triple cheeseburgers called the Limo Burger and the X-Tra Long Cheeseburger, the Bull's-Eye Barbecue Burger which was a type <b>of</b> <b>double</b> cheeseburger that included two hamburger patties, American cheese, bacon and Kraft Bull's-eye brand barbecue sauce, and the BBQ Hero which was also another type <b>of</b> <b>double</b> cheeseburger with barbecue sauce, bacon, lettuce, tomato and onions. The company introduced another burger in this family called the Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburger in June 2014. The sandwich consisted of two burger patties, BBQ sauce and onion rings. It is similar in composition to the chain's Rodeo Cheeseburger.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E.

The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production <b>of</b> <b>double</b> eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints.

5|$|In April 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando would be reviving Double Dare as a nightly live stage presentation, Double Dare Live. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort's guests. The show featured elements and updates from the various versions <b>of</b> <b>Double</b> Dare, including remixed music, physical challenges and an obstacle course similar to the TV show. Like the most recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game-playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. Previews <b>of</b> <b>Double</b> Dare Live began on May 21, 2012, with an official launch date of May 25. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A scaled-down version <b>of</b> <b>Double</b> Dare Live, called Double Dare Challenge, was presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America from June 13 to September 24, 2016, and ran again from June 16 to September 30, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth <b>of</b> <b>double</b> agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited {{by the lack of}} guidance from Cairo and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>double</b> agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:50p.m. (EST) on 8 December 1980, lone gunman Mark David Chapman shot Lennon in {{the back}} {{four times in the}} archway of the Dakota as Lennon and Ono {{returned}} to their Manhattan apartment from the Record Plant.

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic <b>of</b> <b>double</b> envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

I first discuss the lack of systematic, scholarly attention to theatrical doubling in general and develop a new taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>doubling,</b> incorporating two main categories: opractical doublingo and osignificant doublingo. Practical doubling stems from economic necessity; significant <b>doubling,</b> consisting <b>of</b> six subcategories, is employed by directors and actors as a vehicle of meaning. I illustrate this taxonomy through a critical study of the Boyd-directed history plays, showing how the use <b>of</b> <b>doubling</b> in that cycle allowed for a multi-layered approach, which enhanced both coherence and ambiguity...|$|R

5|$|In July 2013, it was {{confirmed}} that Grint {{will be making}} his stage debut in Jez Butterworth's second run of his black comedy, Mojo, playing the role as a minor hood called Sweets who pops amphetamines like Smarties and does a sort <b>of</b> <b>double</b> act, full of comic menace. Grint will be starring alongside actors Brendan Coyle, Ben Whishaw and Daniel Mays. The play is based on real-life events and ran from 26 October 2013 until 8 February 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London. He won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best London Newcomer for his role in this play.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the Gold Glove Award, there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each other for the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>double</b> plays. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>double</b> play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016.|$|E
