5|$|Hamels {{would stay}} a Phillie when {{he agreed to}} a {{contract}} extension on July 24. The six-year, $144 million contract was the second-largest contract ever signed by a pitcher. The deal included a vesting <b>option</b> for 2019 worth $24 million.

5|$|In 2009, the CRS {{proposed}} four options: <b>Option</b> 1 was {{to continue}} the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10billion and the entry into service date was 2019. <b>Option</b> 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. <b>Option</b> 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this <b>option</b> was estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last <b>option</b> was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} <b>option,</b> the North Vietnamese could avoid the {{outlying}} South Vietnamese installations and strike directly at their primary target of Ban Me Thuot. For the first <b>option</b> to be successful, the North Vietnamese had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first <b>option,</b> {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first <b>option</b> would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E

40|$|Real <b>options</b> “in ” {{projects}} {{are the latest}} extension of real <b>options</b> theory into physical systems design. Real <b>options</b> “in ” {{projects are}} different from real <b>options</b> “on” projects. Real <b>options</b> “on ” projects refer to the standard real <b>options</b> treating the physical systems as a “black box”, in contrast with real <b>options</b> “in ” systems that concern design features built into the project or system. This paper defines real <b>options</b> ” in ” projects, addresses its special issues, and presents possible valuation methods. One of the important issues facing real <b>options</b> “in ” projects is that the crux of financial <b>options</b> theory – especially the “no arbitrage ” assumption – is hardly valid for real <b>options</b> “in ” projects. This paper argues that the definition of <b>options,</b> right not obligation, defines basic unit of flexibility. <b>Options</b> thinking offers important insights into flexibility in physical systems...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} <b>option,</b> the North Vietnamese had to destroy all the {{outlying}} South Vietnamese defences {{and then move}} on to Ban Me Thuot.

5|$|On April 2, 2012, Cain {{agreed to}} a five-year {{contract}} extension worth a guaranteed $112.5 million through 2017 with an <b>option</b> for 2018, at the time surpassing Kevin Brown for the largest deal for a right-handed pitcher. Cain earned a $5 million signing bonus, and earned $20 million each season from 2013–17. His $21 million <b>option</b> for 2018 would vest automatically {{if he was not}} on the disabled list to an elbow or shoulder injury in 2017 and if he reached 400 innings in 2016 and 2017 combined. If the <b>option</b> failed to vest, the Giants could either pick up the $21 million <b>option</b> or pay a $7.5 million buyout. Cain was scheduled to become a free agent after the 2012 season.|$|E

5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One <b>option</b> known as the Shallow Chrystie <b>Option</b> would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie <b>Option</b> would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this <b>option</b> would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this <b>option,</b> a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth <b>Option</b> would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie <b>Option</b> would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this <b>option,</b> and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred <b>option.</b>|$|E

40|$|This is a {{collection}} of functions to valuate Asian <b>options.</b> Asian <b>options</b> are path-dependent <b>options,</b> with payoffs that depend on the average price of the underlying asset or the average exercise price. There are two categories or types of Asian options: average rate <b>options</b> (also known as average price <b>options)</b> and average strike <b>options.</b> The payoffs depend on the average price of the underly-ing asset over a predetermined time period. An average is less volatile than the underlying asset, therefore making Asian <b>options</b> less expensive than standard European <b>options.</b> Asian <b>options</b> are commonly used in currency and commodity markets. Asian <b>options</b> are of interest in markets with thinly traded assets. Due to the little effect it will have on the option’s value, <b>options</b> based on an average, such as Asian <b>options,</b> have a reduced incentive to manipulate the underlying price at expiration.
