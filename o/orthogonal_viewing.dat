Viewing {{requirements for the}} SSF indicate that assembly and extravehicular crew operations should be viewed by direct means whenever possible. To analyze {{the extent to which}} the Cupola meets this requirement, positions on the port side of Node 2 and the zenith side of Node 1 were evaluated. These analyses utilized the tasks from Mission Build (MB) 6 through 16 to investigate these two Node positions. The analyses conducted were based on a 4 -position rating scale (Excellent, Good, Marginal, and Inadequate) which solicited data from both expert crewmembers and specialists in the field of robotic assembly operations. To remedy the potential direct viewing problems identified through this investigation, it was recommended that additional camera ports be placed along the truss and on the modules to provide indirect <b>orthogonal</b> <b>viewing</b> for berthing operations and pressurized module attachment. It was also recommended that additional Node positions be investigated to determine the optimal location for the Cupola based on crew considerations, direct viewing requirements, lighting issues, and operational tasking issues...|$|E

METHODS: A prostate phantom was created. A three-dimensional real-time ultrasound system with a 5. 9 MHz probe was used, {{making it possible to}} see several reconstructed <b>orthogonal</b> <b>viewing</b> planes in real time. Fourteen operators performed biopsies first under 2 -D then 4 -D transurethral ultrasound (TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation in a 3 -D ultrasonographic volume. Special software was used to visualise the biopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area. A comparative study was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of the needle. Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a redundancy ratio of the sampled prostate. RESULTS: A significant increase in accuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4 -D ultrasonography as compared to 2 -D. There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in the biopsy distribution with 4 -D ultrasonography as compared to 2 -D. CONCLUSION: The 4 -D TRUS guidance appears to show, on a synthetic model, an improvement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol.

40|$|Aluminized {{ammonium}} perchlorate composite propellants (APCP) form large molten agglomerated particles {{that can result}} in poor combustion performance and increased two-phase flow losses. Quantifying agglomerate size distributions is important for assessing these losses for different types of aluminum fuels that can help improve rocket performance. It is highly desirable to measure particle sizes in-situ using non-intrusive optical methods, rather than conventional particle collection, which can have large uncertainties. Regular high-speed microscopic imaging suffers from a limited depth of field. Digital inline holography (DIH) is an alternative approach that results in 3 D information through numerical reconstruction. In this paper, DIH approach was used with two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>viewing</b> angles for simultaneous particle imaging and velocity measurements. Furthermore, two imaging speeds (4 Hz vs. 4, 000 Hz) were compared to characterize biasing. DIH results were contrasted with high-speed visual imaging and conventional particle collection. All techniques were in agreement that ejected particles were larger than initial constituent particles. However, DIH allows for the acquisition of much less experimental data for statistically significant data sets when compared to videography and more accurately sizes agglomerates than particle collection. Low-speed DIH {{is found to be}} subject to biasing due to multiple counting of larger particles with slower velocities staying in the field of view. A model was employed to correct the velocity biasing was performed by adjusting the data based on size and velocity correlations. This was partially successful to reduce biasing of sizes for the low speed DIH data. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{improved}} {{ground resolution}} of state-of-the-art {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) sensors suggests utilizing SAR data {{for the analysis of}} urban scenes. In high resolution SAR data of built-up areas, especially bright lines are a distinctive building feature. They are often caused by double reflection between ground and building wall. The appearance of such features depends on the illumination geometry, therefore the location of different building walls can be inferred from multi-aspect SAR imagery. Previous studies showed that especially the fusion of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>viewing</b> directions is beneficial with respect to the generation of rectangular building footprints. However, a comparison with cadastral data revealed that the footprints were often oversized. As a consequence, the building height estimates were too low, due to the presence of ground pixels inside the footprint hypotheses. This problem can be solved by investigation of interferometric phase profiles of layover and building roof areas. For this reason an algorithm was implemented to simulate interferometric phase data by taking into account that a mixture of several backscatterers may contribute to the phase value of a single range cell. These simulations are based on intermediate 3 D reconstruction results (i. e. building hypotheses). For this purpose, the geo-position of the building hypotheses and the sensor geometry have to be taken into account. By comparison between real and simulated phase profiles contradictions between the reconstruction hypotheses and the measured InSAR data become obvious. These contradictions steer the iterative improvement of building footprint and height estimate. The assessment of the final building reconstruction results uses cadastral building footprints as 2 D information and a LIDAR DSM as 3...|$|E

40|$|Aeolus {{is a small}} {{satellite}} {{mission to}} observe surface and atmospheric forcing and general circulation of Mars, by measuring surface energy balance, atmospheric temperatures, aerosols and clouds, and winds. Critically, Aeolus will make these measurements at all local times of day, providing information on both seasonal and diurnal variability. To date, direct measurements of Martian wind speeds have only been possible at the surface, only during daylight hours, and over small areas limited by rover traverse capabilities. From orbit, thermal measurements (e. g., estimates from assumed geostrophic balance) as well as images of dust storms and dune migration have provided inputs to derive current data sets on Martian winds. However, Mars General Circulation models demonstrate that wind speeds derived from these indirect measurements may be in error by 50 to 100 %. For this reason, direct wind velocity measurements have been deemed "High Priority" by MEPAG (Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group); measuring wind speeds and corresponding thermal data is vital to understanding the climate of Mars. Aeolus will carry four Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometers (SHS), coupled to two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>viewing</b> telescopes. These high-resolution near-infrared spectrometers will measure CO 2 (daytime absorption) and O 2 (day and night emission) lines in the Martian atmosphere. Doppler shifts in these lines can be measured during Martian day and night, resolving wind speeds down to ~ 5 m/s. Orthogonal views allow the spectrometers to capture wind vectors over all observation locations. Aeolus will also carry the atmospheric limb-viewing Thermal Limb Sounder (TLS) to measure atmospheric temperatures, water ice clouds, and dust abundances across all altitudes where winds are measured. Finally, the Surface Radiometric Sensor Package (SuRSeP), a nadir viewing radiometer, will measure the total reflected solar and emitted thermal radiance, surface temperature, and water cloud and dust total column abundances. The combined spectral and thermal measurements will provide {{a new understanding of}} the global energy balance, dust transport processes, and climate cycles in the Martian atmosphere. Aeolus will consist of a single satellite in a near-polar orbit, allowing it to pass over all local times, with the baseline mission observing all seasons of an entire Martian year (two Earth years).

40|$|The {{importance}} of single {{trees and the}} determination of related parameters has been recognized in recent years, e. g. for forest inventories or management. For urban areas an increasing interest in the data acquisition of trees can be observed concerning aspects like urban climate, CO 2 balance, and environmental protection. Urban trees differ significantly from natural systems {{with regard to the}} site conditions (e. g. technogenic soils, contaminants, lower groundwater level, regular disturbance), climate (increased temperature, reduced humidity) and species composition and arrangement (habitus and health status) and therefore allometric relations cannot be transferred from natural sites to urban areas. To overcome this problem an extended approach was developed for a fast and non-destructive extraction of branch volume, DBH (diameter at breast height) and height of single trees from point clouds of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). For data acquisition, the trees were scanned with highest scan resolution from several (up to five) positions located around the tree. The resulting point clouds (20 to 60 million points) are analysed with an algorithm based on voxel (volume elements) structure, leading to an appropriate data reduction. In a first step, two kinds of noise reduction are carried out: the elimination of isolated voxels as well as voxels with marginal point density. To obtain correct volume estimates, the voxels inside the stem and branches (interior voxels) where voxels contain no laser points must be regarded. For this filling process, an easy and robust approach was developed based on a layer-wise (horizontal layers of the voxel structure) intersection of four <b>orthogonal</b> <b>viewing</b> directions. However, this procedure also generates several erroneous "phantom" voxels, which have to be eliminated. For this purpose the previous approach was extended by a special region growing algorithm. In a final step the volume is determined layer-wise based on the extracted branch areas A i of this horizontal cross-section multiplied by the thickness of the voxel layer. A significant improvement of this method could be obtained by a reasonable determination of the threshold for excluding sparsely filled voxels for noise reduction which can be defined based on the function change of filled voxels. Field measurements were used to validate this method. For a quality assessment nine deciduous trees were selected for control and were scanned before felling and weighing. The results are in good accordance to the control trees within a range of only - 5. 1 % to + 14. 3 %. The determined DBH values show only minor deviations, while the heights of trees are systematically underestimated, mainly due to field measurements. Possible error sources including gaps in surface voxels, influence of thin twigs and others are discussed in detail and several improvements of this approach are suggested. The advantages of the algorithm are the robustness and simple structure as well as the quality of the results obtained. The drawbacks are the high effort both in data acquisition and analysis, even if a remarkable data reduction can be obtained by the voxel structure...|$|E

The motivation of this work is to gather all the macroscopically visible information to support further research and save time and costs. To make the picture most useful should provide an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>view</b> of the outcrop-surface, which {{is parallel to the}} bedding-plane in this case. To achieve this, the outcrop was marked with a grid and than photographed with a telephoto-lens from a fixed spot. The photos were taken in a oblique angle to the outcrop-plane. To provide an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>view</b> the pictures were merged to one big panorama and then distorted {{with the help of the}} grid to an orthogonal view-angle after the field work. Beside the creation of the panorama the vein-network was studied. As a result the vein network could be divided in five different generations and the age-relationships between this generations could be recognized. The oldest generation were the bedding parallel veins. The next younger generation was the N-S-set followed by the E-W set. After that followed the NW-SE set and the SW-NE set was youngest. Finally the picture and the method was evaluated. Summarising the results, the method is practical and it was possible to create an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>view</b> with a great resolution and many details.

A high intra- and interobserver reproducibility of all absolute measurements was found, with the highest correlations for minimum diameter and cross-sectional area (interobserver, R = 0. 85 and 0. 85; intraobserver, R = 0. 93, and 0. 95 for minimum diameter and cross-sectional area, respectively). Of the relative measurements, biplane geometric percent crosssectional area stenosis was the most reliable and percent densitometric area stenosis was the most variable (Interobserver, R = 0. 67; intraobserver, R = 0. 71). Only small differences were demonstrated for the absolute measurements between the analysis of lesions immediately after PTCA and after follow-up, whereas a greater variability was found for relative measurements, especially videodensitometry.
