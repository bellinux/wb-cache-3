5|$|Common <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} {{available in}} three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
40|$|Washington State ranks {{third in}} the U. S. in {{production}} of onions (1). ● Washington produces 16. 2 % of U. S. dry summer onions (1) ● In 2002, 16, 000 acres of storage onions and 1100 acres of non-storage <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> harvested in Washington (1). The value of storage <b>onions</b> <b>was</b> over $ 91 million. Non-storage <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> valued at $ 9. 4 million. ● Dry <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> grown on 165 farms in Washington in 1997 (2). ● Average yield values in 2002 for storage <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> 37 tons/A (3) and 18 tons/A for non-storage onions (1). ● Production costs for storage type <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> approximately $ 2, 607 per acre in 1999 (3). Non-storage onion production costs per acre were $ 3, 850 in 1989 (4) ...|$|R
500|$|While the large, mature <b>onion</b> bulb <b>is</b> {{most often}} eaten, <b>onions</b> can <b>be</b> eaten at {{immature}} stages. Young plants may be harvested before bulbing occurs and used whole as spring onions or scallions. [...] When an <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> harvested after bulbing has begun, but the <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> not yet mature, {{the plants are}} {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "summer" [...] onions.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the rules}} of botanical nomenclature, both the Egyptian onion and Wakegi <b>onion</b> should <b>be</b> {{combined}} into one hybrid species, having the same parent species. Where this is followed, the Egyptian <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> named A. ×proliferum Eurasian group and the Wakegi <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> named A. ×proliferum East Asian group.|$|R
5|$|<b>Onions</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} in fresh, frozen, canned, caramelised, pickled, and chopped forms. The dehydrated product is available as kibbled, sliced, ring, minced, chopped, granulated, and powder forms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Onions</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} chopped {{and used}} as an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may {{also be used as}} a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to hollow out once cooked, facilitating stuffing them, as in sogan-dolma. <b>Onions</b> <b>are</b> a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a thickening agent for curries and gravies. Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are traditionally a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Pickled onions form part of a British pub ploughman's lunch, usually served with cheese and ale. In North America, sliced <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> battered, deep-fried, and served as onion rings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Onions</b> <b>are</b> {{cultivated}} {{and used}} around the world. As a food item, {{they are usually}} served cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.|$|E
50|$|Allium koenigianum, or Koenig's <b>onion,</b> <b>is</b> {{a species}} of <b>onion</b> that <b>is</b> endemic to the Erzurum and Çoruh regions of Turkey.|$|R
5000|$|The wild <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} ethnobotanic food plant for the indigenous Ainu people of Japan. In the Ainu this <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> called pukusa, kitobiru, or ( [...] since [...] "biru/hiru" [...] is a Japanese word for onion-type plants), simply kito.|$|R
50|$|Allium × wakegi, the Wakegi <b>onion,</b> <b>is</b> {{a species}} of {{perennial}} <b>onion.</b> It <b>is</b> a diploid hybrid between the bunching onion and the shallot.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, onions may be bred {{and grown}} to mature at smaller sizes. Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler onions, but differ from true pearl onions which are a different species. Pearl and boiler onions may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} {{origin of}} the onion is uncertain because the wild onion is extinct and ancient records of using onions span western and eastern Asia. The first cultivated, farmed <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> {{the subject of much}} debate, but the two regions that many archaeologists, botanists, and food historians will point to are central Asia or Persia. They were probably simultaneously domesticated by peoples all over the world, as there are species of the onion found the world over. Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Onions</b> <b>were</b> {{taken by}} the first European {{settlers}} to North America, where the Native Americans were already eating wild onions raw or cooked in various foods. According to diaries kept by the colonists, bulb <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> {{one of the first}} crops planted by the Pilgrim fathers.|$|R
50|$|In the West, the Welsh <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} {{used as a}} scallion or salad <b>onion,</b> but <b>is</b> {{widely used}} {{in other parts of}} the world, particularly East Asia.|$|R
50|$|In Vietnam, Welsh <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} to prepare dưa hành (fermented <b>onions)</b> which <b>is</b> served for Tết, the Vietnamese New Year. A kind of sauce, mỡ hành (Welsh onion fried in oil), {{is used in}} dishes such as cơm tấm, bánh ít and cà tím nướng. Welsh <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> the main ingredient in the dish cháo hành, which is a rice porridge used to treat the common cold.|$|R
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Himmel un Aad - {{a dish of}} mashed {{potatoes}} and apples along with slices of blutwurst. Caramelized <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> usually served with this meal.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture is {{centred on}} the {{northern}} slopes, and is also determined by the altitude as well as orientation: in the coastal zone, tomatoes and bananas are cultivated, usually in plastic enclosures, these high yield products are for export to mainland Spain {{and the rest of}} Europe; in the drier intermediate zone, potatoes, tobacco and maize are grown, whilst in the south, <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> important.|$|E
50|$|Onion farming {{began in}} the Westport area in the 1840s. <b>Onions</b> <b>were</b> a cash crop aided by the {{inexpensive}} transportation provided by Westport's location on the Saugatuck River and Long Island Sound. The Civil War drove increased demand for onions; pickled <b>onions</b> <b>were</b> used by the Union Army to reduce scurvy.|$|R

25|$|Dahi is {{also known}} as Mosaru (Kannada), Thayir (Tamil/Malayalam), doi (Assamese, Bengali), dohi (Odia), perugu (Telugu), Qәzana a pәәner (Pashto) and Dhahi or Dhaunro. Raita is a yogurt-based South Asian/Indian condiment, used as a side dish. The yogurt is {{seasoned}} with coriander (cilantro), cumin, mint, cayenne pepper, and other herbs and spices. Vegetables such as cucumber and <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> mixed in, and the mixture is served chilled. Raita has a cooling effect on the palate which makes it a good foil for spicy Indian and Pakistani dishes. Raita is sometimes also referred to as dahi.|$|E
500|$|<b>Onions</b> <b>are</b> best {{cultivated}} in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are {{good as they}} are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require {{a high level of}} nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. Bulbing <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> referred to as [...] "long-day" [...] onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as [...] "intermediate-day" [...] types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, [...] "short-day" [...] onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. <b>Onions</b> <b>are</b> a cool-weather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3to9. Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to [...] "bolt", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.|$|E
500|$|Steppe grasslands predominate in {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. Precipitation is {{irregular}} and averages [...] to [...] per year. Hailstorms, blizzards, and thunderstorms rush across the prairie, which has little shelter for plants or animals. Nevertheless, many animals make their home here: among them, grey wolf, coyote, antelope, jackrabbit, kit fox, and bison. The rattlesnake and bull snake live in this prairie, {{as well as the}} blue racer. Many birds have their habitat here: geese, ducks, falcons, hawks, turkey buzzards, owls, sparrows, larks, blackbirds, and more. Evening primroses, prairie lilies, blazing star, aster, goldenrod, sunflower, and wild <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> common plants. So too are wild alfalfa, buffalo bean, and prairie clover legumes. Vegetation is predominantly blue grama, little bluestem, bunchgrass, buffalograss, wheatgrass, and green needleleaf.|$|E
50|$|A sweet <b>onion</b> <b>is</b> {{a variety}} of <b>onion</b> that <b>is</b> not pungent. Their {{mildness}} is attributable to their low sulfur content and high water content {{when compared to other}} onion varieties.|$|R

2500|$|The Dogon {{maintain}} an agricultural mode of subsistence, and cultivate pearl millet, sorghum and rice, {{as well as}} onions, tobacco, peanuts, and some other vegetables. [...] Marcel Griaule stimulated {{the construction of a}} dam near Sangha and incited the Dogon to cultivate onions. [...] The economy of the Sangha region has doubled since then, and its <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> sold as far as the market of Bamako and even Ivory Coast. They also raise sheep, goats, and chickens. [...] Grain is stored in granaries.|$|E
2500|$|In Thai cuisine, rice congee, {{known as}} chok ( [...] , , a loanword from Min Nan Chinese), is often served as breakfast with a raw or {{partially}} cooked egg added. Minced pork or beef and chopped spring <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> usually added, and the dish is optionally {{topped with a}} small donut-like pathongko, fried garlic, slivered ginger, and spicy pickles such as pickled radish. Although it is more popular as a breakfast dish, many stores specializing in chok sell it throughout the day. Variations in the meat and toppings are also frequently found. It is especially popular during Thailand's cool season. Thai congee is prepared similarly to Lao congee.|$|E
2500|$|In {{northern}} Lebanon, it {{is known}} as a potato with the name Borshoushi (El-Orse Borshushi). It is also prepared as part of a lentil soup with crushed garlic and lemon juice. Also in the north, {{it is known}} by the name [...] "Bouzmet", mainly around Menieh town, where it is first peeled, and left to dry in the sun for a couple of days. After that, it is stir fried in lots of vegetable oil in a casserole till golden brown, then a big amount of wedged, welted <b>onions</b> <b>are</b> added, in addition to water, chickpeas and some seasoning. These are all left to simmer for a few hours, and the result is a stew-like dish. It is considered a hard to make delicacy, {{not only because of the}} tedious preparation, but the consistency and flavour that the taro must reach. The smaller variety of taro is more popular in the north due to its tenderness.|$|E
