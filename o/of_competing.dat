40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown that muscle tics can be suppressed by the performance <b>of</b> a <b>competing</b> response contingent on the occurrence of the muscle tics. In an effort to determine whether the topography <b>of</b> the <b>competing</b> response was important to the muscle tic suppressing effects <b>of</b> contingent <b>competing</b> response practice, we evaluated the effects <b>of</b> a <b>competing</b> response that was topographically dissimilar to the muscle tic. Three subjects engaged in dissimilar competing responses contingent on the occurrence of a muscle tic; 2 of these subjects subsequently engaged in similar competing response practice. The results showed a decrease in objective measures of muscle tic frequency with the introduction <b>of</b> dissimilar <b>competing</b> response practice for each subject; subsequent exposure to similar competing response practice for 2 subjects resulted in no additional decrement in the level of muscle tics. These results suggest that the topography <b>of</b> the <b>competing</b> response may not be crucial for the suppression of muscle tics. Discrepancies between the objective measures of muscle tics and self-recorded measures are noted and discussed...|$|R

5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history <b>of</b> <b>competing</b> empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>competing</b> discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
