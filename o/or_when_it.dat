5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as when it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} by conservatives, such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> opposed the Patriot Act. The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh, George Wallace, Henry Ford, and Oliver North; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory, Rockwell Kent, and Dr. Benjamin Spock.|$|E
5|$|White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or {{in family}} groups. A pair may {{cooperate}} to hunt. Prey can be eaten while {{the bird is}} flying <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> lands on a raised platform such as its nest. The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it. It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{lookalike}} species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E

5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), <b>or,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E

25|$|Fog {{commonly}} produces precipitation in {{the form}} of drizzle or very light snow. Drizzle occurs when the humidity of fog attains 100% and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets. This can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is forcibly compressed from above by descending air. Drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point.|$|E
25|$|Plastoglobuli (singular plastoglobulus, {{sometimes}} spelled plastoglobule(s)), are spherical bubbles of lipids and proteins about 45–60 nanometers across.

Plastoglobuli are found in all chloroplasts, but become more common when the chloroplast is under oxidative stress, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> ages and transitions into a gerontoplast. Plastoglobuli also exhibit a greater size variation under these conditions. They are also common in etioplasts, but decrease in number as the etioplasts mature into chloroplasts.|$|E
