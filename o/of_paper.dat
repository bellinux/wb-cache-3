5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> lies flat.|$|E
5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees.

5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} made up <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> {{with a single}} layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{availability}} of references <b>of</b> research <b>papers</b> and the rich information contained in papers, various citation analysis approaches have been proposed to identify similar documents for scholar recommendation. Despite {{of the success of}} previous approaches, they are, however, based on co-occurrence of items. Once there are no co-occurrence items available in documents, they will not work well. Inspired by distributed representations of words in the literature of natural language processing, we propose a novel approach to measuring the similarity <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> based on distributed representations learned from the citation context <b>of</b> <b>papers.</b> We view the set <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> as the vocabulary, define the weighted citation context <b>of</b> <b>papers,</b> and convert it to weight matrix similar to the word-word cooccurrence matrix in natural language processing.

5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> money. For the printing <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> currency was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E

The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The oldest known piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack.
