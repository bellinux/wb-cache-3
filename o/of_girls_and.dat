5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

25|$|The {{average age}} of first sexual {{intercourse}} in the United States is around 18 for males and around 17 for females, {{and this has been}} rising in recent years. For those teens who have had sex, 70% <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> 56% of boys said that their first sexual experience was with a steady partner, while 16% <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> 28% of boys report losing their virginity to someone they had just met or who was just a friend.|$|E

25|$|The {{country has}} a high {{prevalence}} of FGM, but prevalence is lower among young girls. Ethiopia's 2005 Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) noted that the national prevalence rate is 74% among women ages 15–49. The practice is almost universal in the regions of Dire Dawa, Somali, and Afar. In the Oromo and Harari regions, more than 80% <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> women undergo the procedure. FGC is least prevalent in the regions of Tigray and Gambela, where 29% and 27% <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> women, respectively, are affected. According to a 2010 study performed by the Population Reference Bureau, Ethiopia has a prevalence rate of 81% among women ages 35 to 39 and 62% among women ages 15–19. A 2014 UNICEF report found that only 24% of girls under 14 had undergone FGM.|$|E

25|$|People are {{attracted}} by the stories, by the pace and, {{in the case of}} Stephenie Meyer, it's very clear that she's writing to a whole generation <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual.|$|E
25|$|A feminist {{entrepreneur}} is {{an individual}} who applies feminist values and approaches through entrepreneurship, {{with the goal of}} improving the quality of life and wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> women.

25|$|Tituba, an Indian slave, likely {{became a}} target {{because of her}} ethnic {{differences}} {{from most of the}} other villagers. She was accused of attracting girls like Abigail Williams and Betty Parris with stories of enchantment from Malleus Maleficarum. These tales about sexual encounters with demons, swaying the minds of men, and fortune-telling were said to stimulate the imaginations <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> made Tituba an obvious target of accusations.|$|E
25|$|However, gender {{identity}} <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> women with CAH is nearly always unequivocally female. Sexual orientation is more mixed, though {{the majority are}} heterosexual.

25|$|Mina Caroline Ginger Van Winkle (March 26, 1875 - January 16, 1933) was a crusading social worker, suffragist, and {{groundbreaking}} police lieutenant. From 1919 {{until her}} death in 1933, she led the Women’s Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (in Washington D.C.), and became a national leader in the protection <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> other women during the law enforcement and judicial process. Her provocative statements about gender and morality in the jazz age brought her further national attention.|$|E
25|$|Iroquoian {{cultural}} was matrilineal, several families <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> brothers {{from the}} same maternal lineage shared a longhouse. A married man moved into his wife's longhouse. Unlike the Iroquois Confederacy of upstate New York, West Virginia saw no large centralized sovereign national governments of Native Americans. The extent of proto-Iroquoia and proto-Shanwan cultural and language in West Virginia {{was similar to the}} St. Lawrence Iroquoians' (Laurentian language). By the fourteenth century, a distinct St. Lawrence Iroquoian culture had created fortified villages and introduced corn to the St. Lawrence valley.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{education}} <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> women {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century and was intimately tied to the conception that society had of the appropriate role for women to assume in life. Republican education prepared girls for their future role as wives and mothers and taught religion, singing, dancing, literature, etcetera. Academic education prepared girls for their role as community leaders and social benefactors and had some elements of the education offered boys. Seminaries educated women for the only socially acceptable occupation: teaching. Only unmarried women could be teachers. Many early women's colleges began as female seminaries and were responsible for producing an important corps of educators.|$|E

25|$|Survival International {{has called}} {{attention}} to the rise in suicide in tribal peoples such as the Innu, Australian Aborigines and the Guarani, as a consequence of outside interference with the tribes' cultures and direct persecution. Suffering from the trauma of forced relocation, many tribal people find themselves in despair living in an environment they are not used to, where there is nothing useful to do, and where they are treated with racist disdain by their new neighbours. Other social consequences from this displacement have been pointed out to alcoholism and violence, with campaigns reporting the cases of the Innu, Mursi, Bodi, Konso and Wanniyala-Aetto. Tribal peoples are also more vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Among the tribes with whom Survival International has campaigned, there has been reported rapes <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> women by workers of invading companies in the indigenous tribes of Penan, West Papuan tribes, Jummas and Jarawa.|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|In general, Negev Bedouins {{have one}} of the highest school dropout rates in Israel. Between grades one and twelve, 85% <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> 71% of boys drop out. As with many other areas, poor {{infrastructure}} (especially pronounced in the unrecognized villages, but also in the official towns) is a significant obstacle. The physical conditions of school buildings are often substandard, with many lacking in basic facilities, such as libraries, gyms, cafeterias, and heating and cooling systems. Under Israeli law, education is compulsory for all students between the ages of six and thirteen. However, indifference at the government level has meant that this law has not always been enforced with regards to the Negev Bedouin. Moreover, the government will not support infrastructure developments to schools in the unrecognized villages, as the official policy is to incentivize the relocation of the Bedouin into towns. As the building and maintenance of schools is a municipal matter, there are relatively fewer Bedouin schools (compared to the rest of Israeli society), and schools are often further away from most households.|$|E
