5|$|Historically, UM {{regulated}} {{female student}} conduct more than men's conduct {{with a staff}} under the Dean of Women watching over the women. UM combined the separate Dean of Men and Dean of Women positions in 1971. In 1971, UM formed a Women's Commission which issued a 1974 report on the status <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> campus. The result was UM's first female commencement speaker, day care, and a Women's Study minor. Following the enactment of Title IX in 1972, and decades of litigation, all organizations, including honorary societies were open to women. The Women's Commission also sought more equitable funding for women's sports. Terry Williams Munz {{became the first woman}} in America awarded an athletic scholarship when she accepted a golf scholarship from UM in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{the couple}} {{purchased}} a house together located on Burlington Crescent in Toronto, near Edith's clinic and lived there until their retirement. In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family in Burlington, Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with groups <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in daily from Burlington to visit Williams. She died in 1979, after a series of additional strokes and Fraser returned to the home in Burlington where she remained until three weeks before her death, when her family placed her in a nursing home.|$|E

5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> {{the part of the}} dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They {{were given a}} venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for {{the lifting of the}} ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
5|$|The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Women's Reserve, {{better known}} by the acronym SPARS, was the World War II women's branch of the USCG Reserve. It was {{established}} by the U.S. Congress and {{signed into law by}} the President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 23 November 1942. This authorized the acceptance of women into the reserve as commissioned officers and at the enlisted level, effective {{for the duration of the}} war plus six months. The purpose of the law was to release officers and men for sea duty and to replace them with women at shore stations. Dorothy C. Stratton was appointed director of the Women's Reserve (SPARS), with the rank of lieutenant commander and was later promoted to captain. She had been the Dean <b>of</b> <b>Women</b> <b>on</b> leave from Purdue University, and an officer in The United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve), better known under the acronym WAVES for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Stratton is credited with creating the nautical name of SPARS.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} intended to identify how the revolt {{of the major}} character against the Christian concept <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> is reflected in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. It is a qualitative study. The data are collected by using two kinds of technique: documentation and library research. The technique of data analysis is descriptive analysis. The research significance is to give contribution {{to the body of}} knowledge, particularly the literary study on Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. The result of analysis confirms that Hester Prynne tries to fight against the Christian concept <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> by rejecting the type <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> position, role, rights and participation which are characterized by the concept <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> Christian belief. At last it is known that Hester Prynne’s fight against the Christian concept <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> can be categorized as feminist attitude...|$|R

25|$|With {{a handful}} of exceptions, there was little serious history of women in Australia before the 1970s. Women's history as an {{academic}} discipline emerged in the mid-1970s, typified by Miriam Dixson's The Real Matilda: Woman and Identity in Australia, 1788 to the Present (1976). The first studies were compensatory, filling in the vacuum where women had been left out. In common with developments in the United States and Britain, there was a movement toward gender studies, with a field dominated by feminists. Of recent importance are studies of the role <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> the homefront, and in military service, during world wars. See Australian women during World War I and Australian women in World War II.|$|E

Later he wrote that they included 1,573 RAF, British Army and Royal Navy personnel, 139 Australian Imperial Force personnel and 133 army nurses and signalling personnel. The nurses {{were members of the}} Australian Army Nursing Service from two Australian Army Medical Corps hospitals. Many of the signalling personnel, like the nurses, would have been women.

She is shown to be powerful enough at this size to take down a jet. She has a brief fling with fellow team member Hawkeye.|$|E
25|$|Two {{mirror image}} tombs are {{located at the}} {{southern}} corners of the jilaukhana. They are conceived as miniature replicas of the main complex and stand on raised platforms accessed by steps. Each octagonal tomb is constructed on a rectangular platform flanked by smaller rectangular buildings in front of which is laid a charbargh garden. Some uncertainty exists as to whom the tombs might memorialise. Their descriptions are absent from the contemporary accounts either because they were unbuilt or because they were ignored, being the tombs <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> <b>On</b> the first written document to mention them, the plan drawn up by Thomas and William Daniel in 1789, the eastern tomb is marked as that belonging to Akbarabadi Mahal and the western as Fatehpuri Mahal (two of Jahan's other wives).|$|E

25|$|In April 2013, the Bank of England {{announced}} that its next planned new note issue, {{intended to be}} the £5 note in 2016, will feature former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

In July 2013 it was {{announced that}} the Series F £10 note design would bear a portrait of 19th century author Jane Austen.

25|$|Certain {{demographic}} {{changes in the}} developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, {{in the developing world}} as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rate in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment. Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor. Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Patriarchal {{values are}} deeply {{embedded}} in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed in {{different aspects of the}} society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of patriarchy by women themselves, becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.|$|E
