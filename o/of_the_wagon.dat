5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford the costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> teams of oxen, and supplies {{that would be required}} for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{on-board}} intelligence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{will include}} a GPS location module and a data logger, so that <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> can be located easily. Due to the exact information about <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> they can be dispatched more easily. Thus, together with the new integrated business model, the round trip times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> from nowadays approximately 3  days shall be reduced to 2  days. Furthermore the mileage counting will facilitate a mileage-based maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> {{attendance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{demand for}} freight transport {{is related to}} <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> that in turn {{is associated with the}} way in which the decision is taken. <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> to <b>the</b> shipment terminals depends on the planning as well as on movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>wagons.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> trips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty <b>wagons</b> have <b>the</b> major financial impact on the railroad system. In such a way, an efficient mechanism of wagon distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and <b>of</b> costs. Therefore, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study is to analyze the problem related to <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> load <b>wagons</b> and to develop a mathematical model that can propose an optimal scheduling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons...</b>|$|R
50|$|Eventually <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> {{had their}} roofs raised; CJ 6 and 14 were the trials for this, {{but it is}} not known by how much the {{capacity}} or weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> was increased.|$|R
5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon fell out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train {{reached the end of the}} overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E
50|$|Between 1929 and 1934, it is {{believed}} that vans 121-191 and 369-392 were converted to the TFM class; the differences being only two ice hatches placed closer to <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> and modifications to allow more meat to be held inside <b>the</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> siege <b>of</b> Bihac three {{additional}} wagons were hooked ahead off the formation, {{in order to}} trigger any mines planted on <b>the</b> railway. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> carried tools and materials for railroad repairs if needed.|$|R
50|$|A {{traveller}} {{will notice}} that some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone wall {{along one side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road are slightly protruding. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this was to prevent <b>the</b> axles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> from scraping against the walls and thus becoming damaged.|$|R
5|$|Other new {{features}} {{were added to}} the series, such as the monsters being animated when they attack. The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini-games introduced; the casinos return from previous Dragon Quest games. Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night. While the Monster Master class can catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it is not {{a major part of the}} game. Another returning feature from the past two games is the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon,</b> which allows characters to be swapped out for other ones on the world map.|$|E
5|$|Homer is {{relaxing}} on a Saturday when Marge {{tells him}} {{that he should be}} doing work around the house and yard. Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment. But while there, Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. Homer tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement. He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens, but only makes things worse. In the end, Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement, which angers him. He vents his rage on the construct, mangling it further. Later, Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund, which he does not receive. On the way home, Homer loses control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks. It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman's car, wrecking it. Homer flees the scene of the accident, but the woman tracks him down. It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller (voiced by Isabella Rossellini), and sees Homer's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art. Homer's exhibit goes to the Louvre: American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work, Homer becomes a success.|$|E
5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married Joseph Smith, in 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of Smith. In June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob. Losing her faith and fearful of her life, Coolbrith's mother left the Latter-day Saint community and moved to Saint Louis, Missouri, where she married a printer and lawyer named William Pickett. Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E
25|$|On railway lines where {{rolling stock}} always points the same way, the {{mechanical}} hook may be provided only {{on one end}} <b>of</b> each <b>wagon.</b> Similarly, <b>the</b> hand brake handles may also be on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> only.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T2000 <b>wagons,</b> after only 16 years in operation, and ten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. <b>The</b> two remaining <b>wagons</b> will be preserved and {{displayed at the}} Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|R
25|$|Wooden wedges may {{be forced}} between the stage and the bottom edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> perimeter. Ideally, the wedges are driven under the wagon {{to the extent that}} the wagon is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.|$|E
25|$|A wagon brake has {{a handle}} which, when pushed down, extends a steel rod down {{and onto the}} stage. When fully extended, the steel rod {{actually}} lifts a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> slightly off the stage floor. The bottom end of the rod has a threaded cavity that will accept an extension spindle, which in turn {{can be used to}} adjust the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> above the stage. The brake is released by raising its handle, thereby retracting the steel rod away from the stage.|$|E
25|$|Ward Bond as the Mormon Elder Wiggs, {{the leader}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train (and future {{star of the}} {{television}} series). Bond acted in many films directed by Ford; their relationship is described in the book Three Bad Men: John Ford, John Wayne, and Ward Bond (2013).|$|E
5|$|Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd <b>of</b> bison caused <b>the</b> Willie Company's {{cattle to}} stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost.

25|$|The first {{assault on}} the wagon box corral came from mounted warriors from the southwest, but the raiders {{encountered}} heavy fire from the soldiers using the new breech-loaders. The attackers withdrew, regrouped, and launched several further attacks on foot. They killed Powell's second-in-command, Lt. Jenness, and two soldiers. The battle continued from about 7:30 a.m. until 1:30 pm. The defenders had plenty of ammunition, and were well-defended from arrows behind the thick sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> boxes.|$|E
25|$|NY443 roughly follows an 18th-century {{trail of}} the Mohawk Indians from the Hudson River to Schoharie Valley. It was {{probably}} {{a few years before}} 1787 when Stephen Van Rensselaer III had it upgraded and straightened slightly to make it accessible by wagons. Before that the settlers in the Beaver Dam as the Town of Berne is now known, had to go by way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> road from Altamont, through what is now Knox, to the Schoharie Valley.|$|E
25|$|Various caster {{types are}} used on scenery wagons. The choice of caster type for any {{particular}} wagon {{depends on a}} number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, casters are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of casters required for a wagon depends on caster type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> and scenery.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure the}} {{earliest}} possible delivery, <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam locomotives, railcars, and half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> was contracted to British firms, with 18 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railcars {{had already been}} completed by 1950. The major components for the mainline diesel electric locomotives were to be imported from the United States, dependent on <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> foreign exchange funds from the federal government.|$|R
25|$|This {{model was}} also the last to include <b>the</b> Squire range <b>of</b> Ford Falcons which {{featured}} wood panels on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons,</b> similar to <b>the</b> USA-based station <b>wagons.</b> <b>The</b> Fairmont made its debut, midway through the model run, as <b>the</b> flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> XP Falcon range. It was offered in both sedan and station wagon body styles, replacing the Futura sedan and Squire wagon. Unlike later examples, the XP Fairmonts carried both Falcon and Fairmont badgework.|$|R
25|$|The former wagon {{house in}} the barn complex now houses {{educational}} programs. Future plans include a reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> house and a stabilization of the main barn, to better fit their role as year-round centers for education. Olana has been cited as an innovative example of a public-private partnership. Olana advocates the preservation of its viewshed by encouraging donations of scenic easements on properties and by discouraging development of industrial projects, such as a proposed cement plant and a proposed power plant.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates {{advanced}} north {{along the}} Rio Grande from Fort Bliss in Texas. They won the Battle of Valverde but failed to capture Fort Craig or force the surrender of the main Union Army in the territory. They continued north across the border towards Santa Fe and Fort Union, leaving that Union force in their rear. At Glorieta Pass, the Confederates defeated another Union force from Fort Union, but were forced to retreat following the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon</b> train containing most of their supplies.|$|E
25|$|Hinged foot irons may be {{bolted to}} the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagon.</b> To lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded down and then secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a {{reliable}} method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the stage floor can be damaged.|$|E
2500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{challenging}} effects, {{on the train}} was <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> cars needed to be handled. Mielke had a [...] "very complex rig" [...] created and built to provide the animators involved in the creating process with enough capability as was possible. He stated, [...] "The rig managed that the train automatically followed the rails, that <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> where simulated depending on the rails, that <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> could be changed easily and so on." ...|$|R
50|$|HCP Z1 - is {{a series}} of train {{carriages}} constructed by H. Cegielski in Poznań, which meet the UIC-Z1 standard for passenger train carriages. Several types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> in <b>the</b> standard have been built, with over 100 units built. <b>The</b> main user <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriages is PKP Intercity. The HCP Z1 is also used by the Belarusian Railway and the Polski Tabor Szynowy.|$|R
50|$|ECP can use axle-generated {{power or}} wire-distributed power. The Fortescue railway in Australia uses wire-distributed power at 200 V DC. The Fortescue line also places the two brake pipes and single control/power cables {{on one side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> only, as trains operate only as block loads and <b>the</b> <b>wagons</b> are not {{normally}} reversed. Having the wires on one side avoids the need for crew to stoop under the coupling, as {{would be the case}} with the normal configuration where the hose and wire cross under the coupling.|$|R
