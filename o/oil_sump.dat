500|$|Mariotte, {{named after}} the {{physicist}} Edme Mariotte, was ordered from the Arsenal de Cherbourg on 31 December 1906. The boat was laid down on 30 March 1908 and launched on 2 February 1911 with only the starboard electric motor in place. The port electric motor was under repair {{at the time and}} was installed from 3 May to 21 June and a brief series of trials were conducted. The boat was refitted and further repairs were made to the port-side motor, although continuing problems with her propulsion system often immobilized Mariotte into 1912. She was able, however, to conduct diving, torpedo and underwater speed trials in August and September 1911. The boat was lightly damaged when the air heater of a Modèle 1909R torpedo exploded in its tube on 27 December. Her diesel engines, three years delayed by problems during factory testing, were installed from 1 March to 28 July 1912. They were judged satisfactory after the <b>oil</b> <b>sump</b> and the compressors were changed. After repeated breakdowns, Mariotte conducted her testing of the diesels from 23 October to 11 December and she was finally commissioned (armament définitif) on 5 February 1913 after a complete [...] of her propulsion system.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, the Primula {{was fitted}} with the 1221cc engine from the Fiat 1100 D (for the coupé it was uprated to [...] ), but in 1968 it was {{replaced}} with Fiat 124 engines—the berlinas received the 1197cc [...] engine from the standard versions, while the coupé was fitted with the more powerful 1438cc [...] unit. All engines used in the Primula had overhead valves (OHV)—the later twin cam derivative of the 1438cc unit was not used in any Autobianchi (Fiat did use it later in the Lancia Beta- the issue {{at the time in}} a transverse installation of a twin-cam head being the arrangement of the exhaust manifold of the necessarily cross-flow head). Unlike [...] contemporaneous BMC and Peugeot models, which had the transmission in the <b>oil</b> <b>sump,</b> the Primula had its manual transmission placed end-on, above the differential. The Primula also featured disc brakes on all four wheels, uncommon in small cars of the time.|$|E
2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled <b>oil</b> <b>sump,</b> to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{energy flow}} within the piston {{of an air}} cooled engine was {{investigated}} by measuring the heat flux in the engine cylinder liner {{in the region of}} travel of the piston rings. Engine <b>sump</b> <b>oil</b> temperature and oil viscosity were varied to change the piston ring heat flow by altering the oil film between the cylinder wall and piston ring. Engine load was varied to change heat flow into the piston. Also, the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston was varied to change heat flow leaving the piston. When <b>sump</b> <b>oil</b> temperature was reduced, more heat flowed to the cooler <b>sump.</b> Changes in <b>oil</b> viscosity had little effect on the cylinder wall heat flow but increased cylinder wall temperature due to an increase in frictional heating with lower oil viscosity. It was thus determined that this change in heat flow was due to the change in <b>sump</b> <b>oil</b> temperature and was not due to a change in oil film characteristics. A decrease in engine load decreased the average temperature and heat flux in the cylinder wall. The largest decrease in heat flux was on the exhaust side of the engine where the largest fraction of cylinder heat is convected to the external airflow. It was found that the change in heat flux caused by the decrease in engine load was likely due to a change in the piston ring pack heat flow. For changes in the crankcase oil splash cooling of the piston, there were only small changes in average temperature and no changes in the heat flux. Although the piston was still believed to lose heat to the crankcase oil splash, its percentage of piston heat loss was too small to affect piston ring pack heat flow. Superposition was evaluated for <b>sump</b> <b>oil</b> temperature and engine load as well as <b>sump</b> <b>oil</b> temperature and oil viscosity. In both cases, significant error was found with the linear superposition assumption. Linear superposition was assumed not to hold for these complex heat flows...|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{was mounted}} behind {{and below the}} engine in a {{separate}} casing, rather than sharing the engine's <b>sump</b> <b>oil.</b> This reduced noise levels caused by the Mini's transmission transfer gears and allowed better control of drivetrain shunt and vibration.|$|R
