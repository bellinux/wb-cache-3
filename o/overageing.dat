40|$|International audienceThe Pb–Ca is an age {{hardening}} alloy {{that allows for}} an increase in the hardness compared to pure lead. The hardening is obtained after different successive ageing transformations. In addition, this hardening is followed by an <b>overageing</b> which induces a softening. The ageing and <b>overageing</b> transformation mechanisms are now well identified in lead–calcium alloys. In this paper, we propose to represent the domain of stability of each transformation via time–temperature-transformation diagrams for a calcium concentration from 600 to 1280 ppm and in a range of temperatures from − 20 to 180 ◦C. These diagrams are constructed with the data obtained by in situ ageing with metallographic observations, hardness and electrical resistance measurements. The specificities of lead–calcium such as its fast ageing at ambient temperature and its <b>overageing</b> over time required the design of specific devices to be able to identify the characteristics of these alloys...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the quality index of two Al- 1 %Cu- 4. 5 %Si [...] -Mg alloys as the materials are aged is examined. When underaged {{and up to the}} peak ageing condition the yield strength of the alloys increases while the ductility decreases. The quality index is high and remains approximately constant. At moderate <b>overageing</b> the strength of the alloys decreases rapidly without increase in the ductility and the quality index falls. As the degree of <b>overageing</b> increases the ductility increases again and the quality index tends to increase marginally. The quality index has been related to the material properties using an analytical model. Using this model it is possible to generate a quality index chart that takes into account the change in strain hardening characteristics of the materials with ageing...|$|E

The microstructure, damping capacity and usage temperature were investigated systematically by X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical analyzer. The results show that heat treatment has a significant influence on the damping capacity and usage temperature of as-cast MnCuNiFeZnAl alloy. Compared to the original as-cast alloy with internal friction (Q- 1) of 3. 0 × 10 - 2 at a strain amplitude ε = 2 × 10 - 4 and usage temperature of 43 °C, the largest Q- 1 (5. 0 × 10 - 2) and highest usage temperature (70 °C) can be obtained simultaneously by ageing treatment at 435 °C for 2 h, while homogenization-ageing, solution-ageing and <b>overageing</b> can just result in the limited improvement of damping capacity and usage temperature.

40|$|A {{study was}} made {{of a series of}} steels {{containing}} varying amounts of carbon and vanadium (Table l). The yield and impact characteristics were compared using the relationships between grain size and yield strength and transition temperature as established by PETCH. The precipitation characteristics were studied by micro-hardness testing the ferrite formed under both isothermal and continuous cooling, and the effect of controlling the finishing temperature on rolling on the mechanical properties of one of the steels was also investigated. The results showed an increase in ?i, which increases the yield strength by 2 tons in- 2 for the addition of 0. 2 % V when sufficient carbon is present (0. 25 %). This also gave a rise in transition temperature of 9 °C, the majority of the increase being caused by the initial additions (0. 02 %). The relationships obtained were all non-linear, with the raising of the austenitising temperature giving a continuous increase in ?i. Grain refinement occurred in the 0. 25 % C steels, giving a reduction in transition temperature sufficient to counteract the rise due to the vanadium additions together with an increase in yield of 4 tons in- 2. When insufficient carbon was present, grain refinement did not occur and the yield strength was lowered by 0. 2 % V showing that lowering of ?i due to the loss of carbon from solid solution is greater than the increase due to VC. The impact transition temperature showed a similar rise to the 0. 25 %C steeds. Nitrogen has a greater effect on ?i giving a larger increase in yield strength and transition temperature. A very fine grain size was obtained, but the reduction in transition temperature did not completely offset the rise due to ?i. Vanadium carbide precipitation followed the mode of known theory, secondary hardening being present with 0. 25 %C and 0. 2 % V; <b>overageing,</b> however was rapid. Nitrogen gave secondary hardening at lower vanadium and carbon levels, <b>overageing</b> being much slower. All high carbon steels gave hardening peaks on continuous cooling; rapid <b>overageing</b> again occurred. The final constant hardness increased with increasing cooling rate and it is probable that the highest strength occurs between 2000 and 7000 °C/hr.

40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} ageing time and {{temperature}} following quenching from solution treatment at 540 ± 2 OC on the micro structure and properties of A 201. 0 Al alloy was studied. Using thermodynamic modeling with JMatPro, the intermetallic phases that exist {{at the end of}} solification was determined. Intermetallic phases like CuAl 2, Al 2 CuMg and Mg-Si phase contribute to the hardness of the alloy. Ageing was carried out upto a maximum duration of 10000 hours at a constant temperature of 170 ± 2 OC. As ageing time increased, the hardness of the alloy increased due to the enhanced presence of Guinier-Preston (GP) zones which are coherent with the alloy matrix. With further ageing (<b>overageing)</b> the hardness of the alloy decreases as the precipitate loses its coherency with the alloy matrix...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that Al-Zn-Mg-(Cu) aluminum alloys are susceptible to hydrogen environment assisted cracking (HEAC) when exposed to aqueous environments. In Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, <b>overaged</b> tempers are commonly used to increase HEAC resistance {{at the expense of}} strength. <b>Overaging</b> has little benefit in low copper alloys. However, the mechanism or mechanisms by which <b>overaging</b> imparts HEAC resistance is poorly understood. The present research investigated hydrogen uptake, diffusion, and crack growth rate in 90 % relative humidity (RH) air for both a commercial copper bearing Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy (AA 7050) and a low copper variant of this alloy in order to better understand the factors which affect HEAC resistance. Experimental methods used to evaluate hydrogen concentrations local to a surface and near a crack tip include nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), focused ion beam, secondary ion mass spectroscopy (FIB/SIMS) and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). When freshly bared coupons of AA 7050 are exposed to 90 C, 90 % RH air, hydrogen ingress follows inverse-logarithmic-type kinetics and is equivalent for underaged (HEAC susceptible) and <b>overaged</b> (HEAC resistant) tempers. However, when the native oxide is allowed to form (24 hrs in 25 C, 40 % RH lab air) prior to exposure to 90 C, 90 % RH air, underaged alloy shows significantly greater hydrogen ingress than the <b>overaged</b> alloy. Humid air is a very aggressive environment producing local ({approx} 1 {micro}m) hydrogen concentrations in excess of 10, 000 wt. ppm at 90 C. In the copper bearing alloy, <b>overaging</b> also effects the apparent diffusivity of hydrogen. As AA 7050 is aged from underaged {yields} peak aged {yields} <b>overaged,</b> the activation energy for hydrogen diffusion increases and the apparent diffusivity for hydrogen decreases, In the low copper alloy, <b>overaging</b> has little effect on hydrogen diffusion. Comparison of the apparent activation energies for hydrogen diffusion and for K independent (stage II) crack growth rate in 90 % RH air between 25 and 90 C indicates that hydrogen transport kinetics are responsible for the decreased crack growth rate of <b>overaged</b> AA 7050 relative to the peak aged temper...|$|R
