50|$|The {{climate of}} Yorubaland varies from North to South. The Southern, Central and Eastern {{portions}} of the territory is tropical high forest covered in thick verdant foliage and composed of many varieties of hardwood timber such as Milicia excelsa more commonly known as (Iroko), Antiaris africana, Terminalia superba known locally as (Afara), Entandrophragma or (Sapele), Lophira alata, Triplochiton scleroxylon (<b>Obeche),</b> Khaya grandifoliola (African Mahogany) and Symphonia globulifera amongst numerous other species. Some non-native species such as Tectona grandis (Teak) and Gmelina arborea (Pulp wood) have been introduced into the ecosystem and are being extensively grown in several large forest plantations. The ecosystem here forms the major section of the Nigerian lowland forest region, the broadest forested section of Nigeria.|$|E
50|$|There are 22.9 million {{hectares}} (56.5 million acres) of forest (37 {{percent of the}} total land area), but only 3.4 {{million hectares}} (8.4 million acres) of dense forest, all in the south in the regions bordering the DRC. The CAR’s exploitable forests cover 27 million hectares (68 million acres), or 43% of the total land area. Transportation bottlenecks on rivers and lack of rail connections are serious hindrances to commercial exploitation. Most timber is shipped down the Ubangi and Zaire rivers and then on the Congo railway to the Atlantic. More than a dozen types of trees are felled, but 95 {{percent of the total}} is composed of <b>obeche,</b> sapele, ebony, and sipo.|$|E
5000|$|Dense {{vegetation}} {{covers the}} plateau, {{especially in the}} south. This includes vast tracts of rainforest, which grows {{in three or four}} strata. The tallest trees are straight with buttress roots and stand about 40 m tall. Below these stand thinner, shorter trees with large concentrations of leaves at their tops. The bottom layer is made up of undergrowth of saplings and grasses, although this layer is thin when the larger trees grow close together and block the sunlight. Tree species include azobé, bubinga, ebony, iroko, mahogany, and <b>obeche.</b> This primary rainforest exists in the plateau's south and east. Where human activities have affected the forest, for farming, timber, pasture, and urban growth, secondary growth has taken over as the forest has recovered. This is evident around Yaoundé.|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{the lower}} {{two thirds of}} the {{province}} is covered in rain forest, which grows progressively thicker as one travels south. The forests are composed of hardwood evergreens of species such as dibetu, ebony, iroko, mahogany, <b>obeche,</b> and sapelli, some of which grow to heights of 70 metres or more. There are also numerous ferns and orchids. This forest is stratified into several levels. The first is composed of straight, thick-rooted trees averaging about 40-metres tall. After this grow shorter, thinner trees with highly placed clusters of leaves. Sparse grasses and other plants make up the ground layer. In areas closer to settlements and roads, human groups have harvested the larger trees, thus exposing the forest floor to more direct sunlight and allowing thick vegetation to thrive. The upper third of the province (beginning at about the latitude of Bertoua and Batouri) is dominated by humid, wooded savanna. Trees here are sparser, but still may grow to be as tall as 20 metres.|$|E

40|$|Background It has {{previously}} been shown that a positive skin prick test (SPT) result is a good predictor of a posi-tive specific inhalation challenge (SIC) in patients with occupational asthma (OA) related to wheat or rye flours. This association has not been previously studied in OA attributable to <b>obeche</b> wood. Aims To describe a clinical series of patients with OA induced by <b>obeche</b> wood. To investigate if the SPT result {{can be used as}} a predictor for the outcome of SIC tests. Methods OA was diagnosed according to patient history, lung function examinations and SIC tests, as well as the determination of <b>obeche</b> SPTs. We analysed sensitivity, specificity and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) at different wheal sizes of the SPTs and drew receiver-operating characteristic plots using the SIC test result as the gold standard. Results <b>Obeche</b> wood SIC tests were performed on 34 symptomatic workers. Of these, 27 workers had a positive test result and were diagnosed as having OA. The minimal cut-off value with a PPV of 100 % was an SPT wheal of 3. 5  mm from <b>obeche</b> wood. This means that all workers with a wheal size of ≥ 3. 5 mm from <b>obeche</b> wood had a positive SIC. Conclusions Positive SPT results in symptomatic workers were good predictors of a positive SIC.

40|$|The {{chemical}} structure change and rheological behaviour of heat-treated <b>Obeche</b> (Triplochiton scleroxylon) wood were investigated. Wood samples were treated at 160 and 200 °C for 30, 60 and 120 minutes. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} (DMA) were employed to characterize the {{chemical structure}} and rheological property of the heat-treated wood, respectively. Infrared data showed {{that there was a}} {{reduction in the number of}} hydroxyl groups (one of the factors normally attributed to water absorption) of heat treated wood relative to the control samples. The relative cellulose crystallinity increased slightly which may be one of the factors contributing to the stiffness of the heat-treated wood. The latter increases with increasing treatment temperature and time. The rheological properties of the wood samples were tested while submerged in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone solvent under saturated conditions. DMA results showed that the increasing heat treatment time caused an increase in the glass transition temperature relative to the control sample, irrespective of the treatment temperature.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} chemical preservatives on service life of selected wood species was evaluated {{in a field}} plot at the Forestry research site, University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria. Three wood species, Triplochiton scleroxylon K. Schum (<b>Obeche),</b> Gmelina arborea Linn (Gmelina) and Terminalia ivorensis A Chew (Idigbo- Black afara) were used for this study. Two chemical preservatives namely; acid copper chromate and copper citrate at concentrations of 0 %, 0. 37 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 5 % each and a mixture of the two preservatives (mixed preservative) at the given concentrations were used in treating stakes of these wood species and their retentions determined.
