5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House <b>of</b> <b>Commons</b> immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House <b>of</b> <b>Commons,</b> and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House <b>of</b> <b>Commons</b> by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E

Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House <b>of</b> <b>Commons.</b> Disraeli became a major figure in the party.

40|$|This article {{uses the}} recent Occupy {{litigation}} of Batty v. City of Toronto {{to argue that}} Canadian courts {{no longer have a}} robust understanding <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property and its attendant rights. The lack of judicial understanding <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property is hardly surprising given property theory’s focus on private property, particularly individual private property. This article argues that rather than use the traditional analogy <b>of</b> governments holding <b>common</b> property in trust for the public, Batty relies on an analogy <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property which treats the government as an owner. The emergence of the latter understanding <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property can be traced to Supreme Court jurisprudence from the early 1990 s. Although the government-as-owner analogy <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property was introduced in a concurring judgment, more recent Supreme Court decisions have since reiterated the analogy. Such an understanding <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property is a clear attempt to force all property into a private property model and emphasize the rights of owners above all other rights in property. This article argues that the government-as-owner analogy is problematic given its emphasis on the government’s use of property rather than the public’s benefit from common property and calls for a return to the trust analogy <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property...|$|R
