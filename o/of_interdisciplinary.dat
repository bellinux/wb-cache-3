5|$|Georgia Tech's {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs are divided into six colleges. Collaboration among the colleges is frequent, as mandated by a number <b>of</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> degree programs and research centers. Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its {{undergraduate and}} graduate offerings in less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E

These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly.

He worked with the Regents to increase UCLA's library holdings at a faster pace than Berkeley's library so the two would reach parity. A School of Library Service was instituted in 1960, followed by the School of Architecture and Urban Planning in 1966. The quarter system was implemented in 1965.|$|E
