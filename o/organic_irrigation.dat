40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{industrialization}} {{of agriculture}} {{has led to}} lower efficiency and greater dependence on non-renewable energy. Organic agriculture and traditional agriculture are thus potential alternatives. Cacao is a major crop in Ecuador. However, information on the energy efficiency and economic performance of Ecuadorian cacao {{in relation to the}} production management system is rare and basically inexistent in the case of organic management. Therefore, we studied here the energy and economic performance of the cacao production in the province of Guayas, Ecuador. Four types of management were identified in the province: traditional, semi-intensive, technified, and organic. On the basis of primary data, input-output and energy efficiency were estimated, with special attention given to the use of non-renewable energy and the monetary profitability of each management system. The total energy inputs of the different forms of management have been estimated at 3. 04 for traditional, 12. 47 for semi-intensive, 24. 53 for technified, and 9. 77 GJ ha− 1 for <b>organic.</b> <b>Irrigation,</b> fertilization, and crop protection are the most important inputs for all four types of management, ranging between 85. 7 and 97. 7  %. The non-renewable external energy return on the investment (EROI) has been estimated at 1 : 2. 93 for traditional, 1 : 1. 85 for semi-intensive, 1 : 1. 47 for technified, and 1 : 3. 07 for organic. The different forms of management earned a net margin of 484 for traditional, 1051 for semi-intensive, 2323 for technified, and $ 1565  ha− 1 for organic. Our findings show that the intensification of cacao production increases the net margin per hectare in relation to traditional cacao production, while it significantly reduces its non-renewable external EROI. Well-managed organic farms allow improving non-renewable external EROI by comparison with technified or semi-intensive management strategies, and it also improves the economic performance in relation to semi-intensive systems...|$|E
40|$|Calibration of {{decision}} tools to improve N fertilizer management {{is critical to}} increase its adoption by maize (Zea mays L.) growers. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish nitrate and total nitrogen concentrations in the basal maize stalks (BMS) at harvest to separate maize fields among three N availability categories (N-deficient, N-optimum, and N-excess) under Mediterranean irrigated semiarid conditions. We analysed data from 26 irrigated maize trials conducted between 2001 and 2012. Trials included treatments receiving different N fertilizer rates and sources (mineral and <b>organic),</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems (flood, sprinkler) and soil types. The critical nitrate concentration in BMS to identify N-deficient plots (CNC L) is affected by the irrigation system. The CNC L was lower under sprinkler irrigation (708 mg NO 3 – ­–N/kg) than under flood irrigation (2205 mg NO 3 – ­–N/kg), and the later presented a higher degree of uncertainty compared to sprinkler irrigated systems. The results showed the difficulty to identify the N-deficient plots with the BMS test and the higher sensibility of nitrate-N than total-N concentration in BMS to separate N-deficient from N-optimal plots. Under sprinkler irrigation, nitrate in BMS> 1500 mg NO 3 – –N/kg had a 85 % probability of having received an excess of N. Considering economic net returns to N fertilization, the range of nitrate concentration in BMS that maximized profit under sprinkler-irrigated conditions was established between 1100 and 1700 mg NO 3 – –N/kg. Results suggest that BMS test can be useful in detecting plots with an excess of N but considering irrigation efficiency is crucial for stablishing successful CNC thresholds.

Negative effects in the forms of reduction in wood quality and the environmental impact of log yard run-off must be minimised in order to make wet storage effective. In the work underlying this thesis, the effect of different sprinkling water qualities on changes in wood properties during storage was studied. A new method for treating log yard run-off by using it to irrigate soil-plant systems was also evaluated. Sprinkling experiments were conducted both indoors and outdoors in which the effects of sprinkling on the wood quality of Norway spruce (Picea abies) pulpwood piles were examined. Soil-plant systems with willows (Salix schwerinii x Salix viminalis), alder (Alnus glutinosa) and couchgrass (Elymus repens) were irrigated with Norway spruce log yard run-off and evaluated both in lysimeters and in the field (couchgrass) for their purification capacity. Sprinkling water quality, in terms of salinity, did not affect the inorganic content of wood during storage. Brackish waters can be used without increasing the risk for raising the inorganic contents. Neither did sprinkling with fresh or recycled water affect wood brightness. Factors other than those studied determine the optimal wet storage regime. The composition of different log yard run-offs is very different, but they are all rich in oxygen-consuming <b>organic</b> material. <b>Irrigation</b> of soil-plant systems purifies log yard run-off even at very high irrigation intensities and is a convenient method for practical use.

40|$|ABSTRACT The low {{availability}} {{of water in}} the soil is one of the limiting factors for the growth and survival of plants. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the responses of physiological processes in early growth of guanandi (Calophyllum brasilense Cambess), African mahogany (Khayai vorensis A. Chev) and oiti (Licaniato mentosa Benth Fritsch) over a period of water stress and other of rehydration in the soil with and without addition of organic matter. The study was conducted in a greenhouse and the experimental design was completely randomised into a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial scheme, comprising three species (guanandi, African mahogany, and oiti), two water regimes (with and without water restriction) and two levels of organic fertilisation (with and without the addition of <b>organic</b> matter). <b>Irrigation</b> was suspended for 15 days in half of the plants, while the other half (control) continued to receive daily irrigation, the soil being maintained near field capacity for these plants. At the end of the stress period, the plants were again irrigated for 15 days to determine their recovery. Water restriction reduced leaf water potential and gas exchange in the three species under study, more severely in soil with no addition of organic matter. The addition of this input increased soil water retention and availability to the plants during the suspension of irrigation, reducing the detrimental effects of the stress. During the period of rehydration, there was strong recovery of water status and leaf gas exchange. However recovery was not complete, suggesting that some of the effects caused by stress irreversibly affected cell structures and functions. However, of the species being studied, African mahogany displayed a greater sensitivity to stress, with poorer recovery...|$|R

In this study, set in a residential neighborhood of Tampa (U. S.). I tested whether there are distinct lawn system management strategies characterized by systematic differences in reclaimed water usage and irrigation and fertilization practices. I then investigated whether soil biogeochemistry responds to lawn system management strategy. My results indicated that amendment strategy, which includes water source type, frequency of fertilization, and frequency of irrigation varies among residents of comparable neighborhoods. In this case, these three categories of management behaviors tend to co-occur. Analysis of irrigation water samples collected in this study showed significant differences between potable and reclaimed water. Mainly, reclaimed water had higher conductivity and phosphate content than potable water. When looking at the soil biogeochemical characteristics {{of the study area}} I found that there were significant differences in soil nutrients and microbial biomass across amendment strategy. Soils with a high amendment strategy (frequently irrigation with nutrient-rich reclaimed water, plus frequent fertilizer addition) showed higher conductivity and a higher microbial biomass than soils on lawns with a low amendment strategy (infrequent irrigation with dilute potable water, plus infrequent fertilizer addition). A positive correlation between soil conductivity and microbial biomass was observed. These findings suggest that high amendment strategy increases the input flux of some nutrients to the soils and acts as a nutrient resource for soil microorganisms. The differences between soil and microbial biomass amendment strategy support the idea that decisions made by individuals about which management intensity strategy to use do affect the spatial variability of the ecosystem. These results contribute to the hypothesis of urban ecological urbanization by looking at the vertical social interactions between municipalities and individual homeowners. These interactions might explain the observed spatial variability of ecological characteristics.

40|$|Uncertainties in {{national}} inventories originate {{from a variety}} of sources, including methodological failures, errors, and insufficiency of supporting data. In this study, we analyzed these sources and their contribution to uncertainty in the national inventory of rice paddy methane emissions in China and compared the differences in the approaches used (e. g., direct measurements, simple regressions, and more complicated models). For the 495 field measurements we collected from the scientific literature, the area-weighted 95  % CI (confidence interval) ranged from 13. 7 to 1115. 4  kg CH 4  ha − 1, and the histogram distribution of the measurements agreed well with parameterized gamma distributions. For the models, we compared the performance of methods of different complexity (i. e., the CH 4 MOD model, representing a complicated method, and two less complex statistical regression models taken from literature) to evaluate the uncertainties associated with model performance as well as the quality and accessibility of the regional datasets. Comparisons revealed that the CH 4 MOD model may perform worse than the comparatively simple regression models when no sufficient input data for the model is available. As simulated by CH 4 MOD with data of <b>irrigation,</b> <b>organic</b> matter incorporation, and soil properties of rice paddies, the modeling methane fluxes varied from 17. 2 to 708. 3  kg CH 4  ha − 1, covering 63  % of the range of the field measurements. When applying the modeling approach to the 10  km [*]×[*]  10  km gridded dataset of the model input variables, the within-grid variations, made via the Monte Carlo method, were found to be 81. 2 – 95. 5  % of the grid means. Upscaling the grid estimates to the national inventory, the total methane emission from the rice paddies was 6. 43 (3. 79 – 9. 77)  Tg. The fallacy of CH 4 MOD contributed 56. 6  % of the total uncertainty, with the remaining 43. 4  % being attributed to errors and the scarcity of the spatial datasets of the model inputs. Our analysis reveals the dilemma between model performance and data availability when using a modeling approach: a model with better performance may help in reducing uncertainty caused by model fallacy but increases the uncertainty caused by data scarcity since greater levels of input are needed to improve performance. Reducing the total uncertainty in the national methane inventory depends on a better understanding of both the complexity of the mechanisms of methane emission and the spatial correlations of the factors that influence methane emissions from rice paddies...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} {{has largely}} been increasing in recent decades, and it became present in the producing agenda of various countries, presenting high growth rates over the last years. The organic acerola is grown in Coastal Irrigation District Board of PiauÃ â DITALPI where there are three cooperatives working {{in order to increase}} the production and generate employment and income. The name of the cooperative that we analyzed in this study is Cooperativa Biofruta, formed by 26 producers, which only 23 of them were analyzed. The quesion in analysis consists in determine if the production of organic acerola is economically feasible and low-risk. So, specifically, we seek to characterize the producers of the Cooperativa BIOFRUTA, calculate and analyze the economic feasibility of production of acerola producers of this cooperaative, under deterministic condition, and, estimate and analyse, under risk conditions, some economic indicators to the producers of the Cooperativa BIOFRUTA. To achieve these objectives, were used primary data, referred to the production growth in 2011, as well as the secondary data. The results showed {{that the majority of the}} producers were between 30 and 50 years old, with a level of education considered excellent, large experience in the area of <b>organic</b> products and <b>irrigation,</b> used the micro aspersion system and were satisfied with the cooperative. The deterministic assessment presented low values for gross margin, net marginandaverage net revenue, concluding that it happens becausethere areproducersinvery different situations, withsignificant dispersion ofproduction conditions. That is why it was decided to divide the producers in three scenarios, where in the first one were put all the producers, the second one only those who had negative net margin and the third scenario with the ones who had positive net margin. Deterministically analyzing the scenarios it was concluded that the producers of the 1 st scenario had no injury, but did not have a good return, as the producers of the 2 nd had injury, while the 3 rd scenario, presented positive profits and a more comfortable situation compared to the other scenarios. In the risk assessment, it was found that the producers of the 1 st scenario were subject to high risk in production, that the producers in the 2 nd scenario have 100 % risk to continue producing and, as the market price is given, these producers need to improve their productivity to get out of this situation, since they can not influence the price. The best results were given by the 3 rd scenario producers, that proved be quite profitable and low risk.

Assim, especificamente, procura-se caracterizar os produtores da Cooperativa BIOFRUTA; calcular e analisar a viabilidade econÃmica da produÃÃo de acerola dos produtores da Cooperativa, sob condiÃÃo determinÃstica; e estimar e analisar, sob condiÃÃes de risco, alguns indicadores econÃmicos para os produtores da organizaÃÃo sob exame. Para alcanÃar estes objetivos, foram utilizados dados primÃrios, referentes Ã produÃÃo desenvolvida em 2011, assim comoindicadores secundÃrios. Os resultados mostraram que a maioria dos produtores tem idade entre 30 e 50 anos, com um nÃvel de escolaridade considerado Ãtimo, grande experiÃncia na Ãrea de orgÃnicos e irrigaÃÃo, usavam o sistema de microaspersÃo e estavam satisfeitos com a Cooperativa. A avaliaÃÃo determinÃstica demonstrou valores baixos de MargemBruta, MargemLÃquida e receita LÃquida mÃdia, concluindo-se que se deve ao fato de existirem produtores em situaÃÃes muito diferentes, com grande dispersÃo de condiÃÃes de produÃÃo.

40|$|Migrations and {{population}} outbreaks of millipedes are phenomena that, {{due to their}} unpredictability, have {{attracted the attention of}} researchers in order to obtain information for a better understanding of this occurrence and for the adoption of efficient control methods when these arthropods cause damage to urban and cultivated areas. Cloudsley-Thompson (1949) reported that individuals of Fontariavirginensis spread over an area of 75 acres in West Virginia (USA) farms in such large numbers that cattle were unable to graze and workers were nauseated by the odor exhaled by dead diplopods. At night and on cloudy days they moved in large numbers; most of them (a number estimated at 65 million animals) were killed by the heat of the sun. Niijima e Shinohara (1988), in turn, reported that in Hungary in 1878, in France in 1900, and in Germany in 1906 and 1938, railroad tracks had to be covered with sand for train wheels to be able to adhere to them. In the same article, they pointed out that in Japan the millipede Parafontaria laminata became known by interrupting railroad traffic and emphasized that the population explosions of this millipede occurred at 7 to 8 year intervals and that most of the animals found were adults or sub-adults. This fact has raised speculations about the fact that mating could be a probable cause of such explosions. In Brazil, {{since the beginning of the}} 90 ’s, a population expansion of the millipede Plusioporus setiger (Brolemann, 1901) (Spirostreptida: Spirostreptidae) has been observed in coffee plantations in the Alto Paranaíba region, MG (18 º 37 ´- 19 º 00 ´S; 46 º 52 ´- 47 º 30 ´W) – a "cerrado" region that was deforested in the 70 ’s for coffee culture. The infestations probably started in the coffee plantations of the Macaúbas Farm – Patrocínio, and today reach coffee plantations in Monte Carmelo, Iraí de Minas and Ibiá. The phenomenon has been attributed to <b>organic</b> fertilization and <b>irrigation</b> of the coffee plantations and also to the use of chemical pesticides that may have eliminated possible competitors. These practices have created an environment highly favorable to the survivalof millipedes, which are adapted to locations with large amounts of organic matter and high relative humidity (BOCCARDO et al. 1997) There are no recorded data demonstrating whether Plusioporus setiger was introduced or is a species native to the region. However, the species is known to be able to migrate and to adapt to conditions artificially created by man. Indeed, migration is a characteristic of various millipede species and in situations such as those observed inPatrocínio and Ibiá, although they do not damage the coffee lantations, the animals accumulate in river sources, invade houses and damage vegetable gardens and small plantations, especially during th rainy season. A study conducted during the dry season in order to assess the "hibernating" population of P. setiger revealed an alarming number of approximately 300 millipedes/m 2 (BOCCARDO et al. 1999 b) Many attempts have been made to contain the population outbreaks of Plusioporus. setiger in the region by chemical control, without satisfactory results. Several insecticides have been found to be of low toxicity since millipedes, especially during the adult phase, present a rigid and calcified exoskeleton that may act as a barrier against the penetration of chemical products applied by spraying (BOCCARDO & FERNANDES, 2000; BOCCARDO et al. 2001) There is no consensus about the origin of the organic matter introduced in the coffee plantations of the Macaúbas Farm. It has been proposed that this organic matter may have been brought from the State of São Paulo, or from Paraná, carrying with it the species in question. In the case of the Monte Carmelo and Iraí de Minas farms, the population expansion was facilitated by the proximity to the Macaúbas Farm. It should also be pointed out that these farms (belonging to different municipalities) are located along a highway and represent an area not interrupted by barriers such as towns, rivers etc., a fact that has facilitated migration. However, in the case of the Shimada Farm located between the municipalities of Ibiá and São Gotardo, MG, one of the farms more heavily attacked, the migratory process cannot explain the population expansion ofPlusioporus setiger, since the farm is located in a position opposite to that of the remaining ones, interrupted by the town of Patrocínio and other geographic barriers. The species is believed to have established itself there through the exchange of machinery, coffee plant cuttings, vehicles etc. originating from other infested farms. Today the Plusioporus setiger population is greatly reduced on the Macaúbas Farm – Patrocínio. However, there still are some adults and the presence of eggs and of juvenile individuals may indicate the occurrence of new outbreaks. On the other farms, including the Shimada Farm, there are large amounts of adult and young individuals and the presence of many eggs observed during the rainy season may indicate that the outbreak will continue to be present in the region at least as long as conditions are favorable. Thus, due to the migratory characteristic of this millipede, it is probable thatthe population outbreak will continue to extend to other coffee plantations, possibly causing economic losses in addition to disturbances in human dwellings. Although no damage to the coffee plantations was observed, it is important to point out thatPlusioporus setiger has been found to be a potential consumer of vegetables such as lettuce, potatoes, beets, carrots and manioc in the laboratory. Since the beginning of outbreaks in coffee plantations, investments have been made in research and alternatives have been sought for the control of these arthropods. Some emergency measures have been suggested, such as cleaning the land around the houses to prevent millipede accumulation and using a specific varnish on the walls to prevent the animals from climbing them and entering the house. Biological control through the use of entomopathogenic nematodes has been proposed since several chemical control attempts have been unsuccessful. The first laboratory assays have been performed and have yielded satisfactory results. In parallel to these assays, awheat bran bait was elaborated containing an organophosphorus insecticide (Diazinon) that demonstrated high efficiency in the control of diplopods under laboratory conditions (LAGO-MEIRA et al., 2001). In summary, the objective is not to exterminate millipedes in the region but rather to control their populations. From an ecological viewpoint, millipedes cannot beconsidered to be "pests" since they play an important role in the maintenance of equilibrium in ecosystems by contributing to the decomposition of organic matter and to the enrichment and humidification of soil (BOCCARDO, 1991; HOPKIN & READ, 1992). Thus, the conservation of the productive integrity of soil should be insured. However, the introduction of new conservation practices should be implemented as long as they are previously planned in order to prevent environmental impacts and consequent damage to man and to other animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} called soil aggregate coalescence {{occurs at}} contact-points between aggregates and causes soil strength to increase to values that can inhibit plant root exploration and thus potential yield. During natural wetting and drying, soil aggregates appear to ‘weld’ together {{with little or}} no increase in dry bulk density. The precise reasons for this phenomenon are not understood, but it has been found to occur even in soils comprised entirely of water stable aggregates. Soil aggregate coalescence has not been widely observed and reported in soil science and yet may pose a significant risk for crops preventing them from achieving their genetic and environmental yield potentials. This project used soil penetrometer resistance and an indirect tensile-strength test to measure the early stages of aggregate coalescence and to evaluate their effects on the early growth of tomato plants. The early stages of aggregate coalescence were thought to be affected by a number of factors including: the matric suction of water during application and subsequent drainage, the overburden pressure on moist soil in the root zone, the initial size of soil aggregates prior to wetting, and the degree of sodicity of the soil aggregates. Seven mainexperiments were conducted to evaluate these factors. The matric suction during wetting of a seedbed affects the degree of aggregate slaking that occurs, and the strength of the wetted aggregates. The matric suction during draining affects the magnitude of ‘effective stresses’ that operate to retain soil structural integrity as the soil drains and dries out. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of matric suction (within a range of suctions experienced in the field) on aggregate coalescence using soils of two different textures. Sieved aggregates (0. 5 to 2 mm diameter) from a coarse-textured and two fine-textured (swelling) soils were packed into cylindrical rings (4. 77 cm i. d., 5 cm high) and subjected to different suctions on wetting (near-saturation, and 1 kPa), and on draining (10 kPa on sintered-glass funnels, and 100 kPa on ceramic pressure plates). After one-week of drainage, penetrometer resistance was measured as a function of depth to approximately 45 mm (penetrometer had a recessedshaft, cone diameter = 2 mm, advanced at a rate of 0. 3 mm/min). Tensile strength of other core-samples was measured after air-drying using an indirect “Brazilian” crushing test. For the coarse-textured soil, penetrometer resistance was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation, despite there being no significant increase in dry bulk density; {{this was not the case}} for the finer-textured soils, and it was difficult to distinguish the effects of variable bulk density upon drying from those of the imposed wetting treatments. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, the tensile strength was significantly greater for samples wet to near-saturation. Thus wetting- and draining-suctions were both found to influence the degree of soil aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. Aggregate coalescence in irrigated crops is known to develop as the growing season progresses. It was therefore thought to be linked to the repeated occurrence of matric suctions that enhance the phenomenon during cycles of wetting and draining. An experiment was conducted to determine the extent of aggregate coalescence in a coarsetextured and two fine-textured (swelling clay) soils during 8 successive cycles of wetting and draining. Sieved aggregates (0. 5 to 2 mm diameter) from each soil were packed into cylindrical rings (4. 77 cm i. d., 5 cm high) and wetted to near saturation for 24 h. They were then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week, after which penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured as described above. The degree of expression of aggregate coalescence depended on soil type. For the coarse-textured soil, repeated wetting and draining significantly increased bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. For the fine-textured soil, penetrometer resistance and bulk density did not vary significantly with repeated wetting and draining; on the contrary, there was evidence in these swelling clay soils to suggest bulk density and penetrometer resistance decreased. However, there was a progressive increase in tensile strength as cycles of wetting and draining progressed. The expansive nature of the fine-textured soil appears to have masked the development of aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance, but its expression was very clear in measurements of tensile strength despite the reduction in bulk density with successive wetting and draining. Field observations have indicated that aggregate coalescence is first expressed at the bottom of the seedbed and that it develops progressively upward to the soil surface during the growing season. This suggests that overburden pressures may enhance the onset of the phenomenon by increasing the degree of inter-aggregate contact. Soils containing large quantities of particulate organic matter were known to resist the onset of aggregate coalescence to some extent. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil organic matter and overburden pressures, by placing brass cylinders of various weights (equivalent to static load pressures of 0, 0. 49, 1. 47 and 2. 47 kPa) on the top of dry soil aggregates (0. 5 – 2 mm diameter) having widely different soil organic carbon contents placed in steel rings 5 cm high and 5 cm i. d. With the weights in place, the aggregates were wetted to near-saturation for 24 h and then drained on ceramic pressure plates to a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Bulk density, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured when the samples were removed from the pressure plates and they all increased significantly with increasing overburden pressure in the soil with low organic matter content, but not in the soil with high organic matter content. The amount of tillage used to prepare seedbeds influences the size distribution of soil aggregates produced – that is, more tillage produces finer seedbeds. The size distribution of soil aggregates affects the number of inter-aggregate contact points and this was thought to influence the degree of aggregate coalescence that develops in a seedbed. Previous work has shown that soil organic matter reduces aggregate coalescence and so an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of aggregate size and organic matter on the phenomenon. For soils with high and low organic matter contents, aggregate size fractions of < 0. 5, 0. 5 – 2, 2 – 4, and < 4 mm were packed into soil cores (as above) and wetted to near-saturation then drained to 100 kPa suction as described above. Penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were measured and found to increase directly with the amount of fine material present in the soil cores – being greater in the < 0. 5 mm and < 4 mm fractions, and being less in the 0. 5 – 2 mm and 2 – 4 mm fractions. In all cases, penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were lower in the samples containing more organic matter. The rate at which soil aggregates are wetted in a seedbed affects the degree of slaking and densification that occurs, and the extent to which aggregates are wetted influences the overall strength of a seedbed. Both wetting rate and the extent of wetting were believed to influence the onset of aggregate coalescence and were thought to be affected by soil <b>organic</b> matter and <b>irrigation</b> technique. An experiment was therefore designed to separate these effects so that improvements to management could be evaluated for their greatest efficacy – that is, to determine whether management should focus on improving irrigation technique or increasing soil organic matter content, or both. The rate of wetting was controlled by spraying (or not spraying) soil aggregates (0. 5 – 2 mm diameter) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Samples of coarse- and fine-textured soils were packed into steel rings (as above) and subjected to different application rates of water (1, 10 and 100 mm/h) using a dripper system controlled by a peristaltic pump. Samples were brought to either a near-saturated state or to a suction of 10 kPa for 24 h, and then drained on a pressure plate at a suction of 100 kPa for one week. Measurements of penetrometer resistance and tensile strength were then made as described above. As expected, penetrometer resistance was lower in samples treated with PVA before wetting (slower wetting rates) and in samples held at a greater suction (10 kPa) after initial wetting (greater inter-aggregate strength). The effects were more pronounced in the coarse-textured soil. In both coarse- and fine-textured soils, tensile strengths increased with increasing wetting rate (greatest for 100 mm/h) and extent of wetting (greater when held at near-saturated conditions). The rate of wetting was found to be somewhat more important for promoting aggregate coalescence than the extent of wetting. Because aggregate coalescence often occurs {{with little or no}} increase in bulk density, an explanation for the increase in penetrometer resistance and tensile strength is unlikely to be explained by a large increase in the number of inter-aggregate contacts. An increase in the strength of existing points of inter-aggregate contact was therefore considered in this work. For inter-aggregate bond strengths to increase, it was hypothesized that small increases in the amount of mechanically (or spontaneously) dispersed clay particles, and subsequent deposition at inter-aggregate contact points could increase aggregate coalescence as measured by penetrometer resistance and tensile strength. An experiment was devised to manipulate the amount of spontaneously dispersed clay in coarse- and fine-textured soils of high and low organic matter content. The degree of|$|R
