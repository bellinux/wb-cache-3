5|$|In 2005, {{following}} the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation, and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. In 2012, the 50th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world. Benedict resigned due to advanced age in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly six hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Italy, {{being one}} of Catholicism's seminal nations, {{has a long history}} of music for the Roman Catholic Church. Until {{approximately}} 1800, it was possible to hear Gregorian Chant and Renaissance polyphony, such as the music of Palestrina, Lassus, Anerio, and others. Approximately 1800 to approximately 1900 was a century during which a more popular, operatic, and entertaining type of church music was heard, to the exclusion of the aforementioned chant and polyphony. In the late 19th century, the Cecilian Movement was started by musicians who fought to restore this music. This movement gained impetus not in Italy but in Germany, particularly in Regensburg. The movement reached its apex around 1900 with the ascent of Don Lorenzo Perosi and his supporter (and future saint), Pope Pius X. The advent <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> however, nearly obliterated all Latin-language music from the Church, once again substituting it with a more popular style.|$|E

In March 1987 he went further than Paul VI in extending the Catholic views on Mary beyond Vatican II by issuing the encyclical Redemptoris Mater. Rather than being just a new presentation of the Marian views <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II,</b> Redemptoris Mater was in many aspects a re-reading, re-interpretation and further extension of the teachings <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II’s</b> handling <b>of</b> {{the theme of}} obedience, conducted {{from the standpoint of}} systematic theology. It is not a study of the development of ideas about obedience {{during the course of the}} Council; it treats Vatican Il 1 s documents as a finished corpus, using earlier magisterial statements as historical background against which to discern shifted emphases in the theology presented by the Council. In Chapter I we establish obedience as a pivotal idea in relation to which the co-ordination <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II's</b> ecclesiology, anthropology, and doctrine of God may be examined. Chapters II-V consider the place of obedience in the Council's ecclesiology; we find obedience correlated with a view of authority rooted in the concept of the ‘invitatory sign'. This view modifies the formerly predominantly jurisdictional emphasis in the Catholic perception of authority, by integrating jurisdiction more closely with kerygma and sacrament. However, although the jurisdictional element of authority is thus modified and relativised, it remains important. We find that <b>Vatican</b> <b>II's</b> ideal <b>of</b> obedience is generally logically consistent with its view of authority, but is not necessarily socially plausible. In matters of doctrine, issues are made more complex still by the Council's shift in epistemology. This, together with the fresh kerygmatic and sacramental perspectives, made it inevitable that infallible teaching should prove contentious after the Council. Chapter VI forms a bridge: The implications <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II’s</b> concept <b>of</b> ecclesiastical obedience for anthropology and the doctrine of God are drawn out. In Chapter VII we test hitherto unexamined passages from the documents against these implications. Generally, we find broad theoretical consistency throughout <b>Vatican</b> <b>II’s</b> presentation <b>of</b> the divine-human relationship in all its 'moments', of which obedient Church membership is one. The extent of this consistency, together with remaining tensions, are summarised in the Postscript...|$|R

25|$|The {{works of}} Asín Palacios are widely admired, {{notwithstanding}} criticism that his view point {{was of a}} Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies.

25|$|In the {{succeeding}} decades, {{some parts of}} the 1917 Code were retouched, especially under Pope Pius XII. In 1959, Pope John XXIII announced, together with his intention to call the Second Vatican Council a Synod of the Diocese of Rome, that the 1917 Code would be completely revised. In 1963, the commission appointed to undertake the task decided to delay the project until the Council had been concluded. After the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican (Vatican II) closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II.</b> When work finally began, almost two decades of study and discussion on drafts of the various sections were needed before Pope John Paul II could promulgate the revised edition, which came into force on 27 November 1983, having been promulgated via the apostolic constitution Sacrae Disciplinae Leges of 25 January 1983. Containing 1752 canons, it is the law currently binding on the Latin Church.|$|E

[...] In the analysis of John Allen, Pope Francis' strong dislike for clericalism, which he calls [...] "one of the worst evils" [...] in the Church is a key factor for [...] "what Francis admires about Opus Dei, since Escrivá’s emphasis on {{the dignity of the}} laity was a challenge to the ultra-clerical ethos of Spanish Catholicism in the late 1920s." [...] He has a devotion to St. Josemaria, and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes, when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome. Francis beatified Alvaro del Portillo, the successor of Escriva. What Bergoglio most liked about Opus Dei was the work done for the poor by one of its schools in Buenos Aires. He thanks Opus Dei for its work to further the holiness of priests in the Roman Curia.|$|E

[...] This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons {{to believe that the}} ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation <b>of</b> <b>Vatican</b> <b>II.</b> However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Declaration on Masonic Associations, which states: [...] "...the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enrol in Masonic associations {{are in a state of}} grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion." [...] For its part, Freemasonry has never objected to Catholics joining their fraternity. Those Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE deny the Church's claims. The UGLE now states that [...] "Freemasonry does not seek to replace a Mason's religion or provide a substitute for it." ...|$|E
