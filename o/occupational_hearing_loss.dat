The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate {{the prevalence}} and risk factors of <b>occupational</b> noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in drivers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 4300 long-distance drivers age ≥ 20 years taken out of a total of 10, 000 estimated professionals in the city of Isfahan, Iran, from February 2006 through March 2007. The drivers were interviewed and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric data, and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated booths. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 40. 8 (11. 0) years with a mean (SD) duration of professional driving of 14. 7 (9. 6) years. Results: The prevalence of bilateral noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was 18. 1 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 17. 0 ~ 19. 3]. The prevalence rates were higher in the left ear only 6. 5 % (95 % CI: 5. 8 ~ 7. 3) than the right ear only 3. 0 % (95 % CI: 2. 5 ~ 3. 9). Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model for the right and left ear only and for both ears separately, age was a significant independent predictor of bilateral noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and for the left or right ear only.

Methodology: All staff working in the selected plywood industry excluding the ones with chronic otitis media were included. Relevant history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using prestructured questionnaire based proforma. All of them underwent pure tone audiometry. Results: Of 111 workers who were exposed to noise, 51. 85 % had NIHL, the average ambient noise being 80. 5 dB. The most common complaints in workers with NIHL was <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (52. 6 %), difficulty in hearing in noisy surroundings (43. 9 %), and difficulty in telephonic conversations (38. 6 %).
