40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are the causative agnets of many human and animal diseases. Over the past decade the {{complete}} sequencing of many staphylococcal and streptococcal genomes has promoted a significant advance in our knowledge of these important pathogens. The pathogenicity of these bacteria {{is due to the}} expression of a large variety of virulence factors. Such determinants, which are cell wall-associated and secreted proteins, include adhesins that confer to the pathogen the ability to attach to extracellular matrix/plasma and host cell surfaces, proteins that contribute to host cell invasion and intracellular survival and soluble factors that decrease phagocytosis and modulate the immune response. Furthermore, these Gram-positive cocci in many natural environments (heart valve, lung, <b>oral</b> cavity, <b>throat)</b> <b>and</b> <b>infections</b> on implanted devices live in matrix-encased groups known as biofilms. Biofilms are specialized bacterial communities with high order organization analogous to that of a tissue in multicellular organism that adhere to abiotic or biological substrata and produce an exopolymeric matrix composed of polysaccarides, proteins, DNA or combination thereof. Bacteria within a biofilm persist in adverse conditions, show resistance to killing by antibiotics and to host immune defences and are difficult to eradicate and treat clinically. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of biofilm development will allow us to effectively combat staphylococcal/streptococcal biofilm-based infections. This Research Topic will focus on the molecular components involved in biofilm formation by staphylococci and streptococci, the role they play in the development, maturation and dispersal of biofilm and on the regulatory aspects of such complex processes. The implication for the pathogenesis of infective diseases and potential therapeutic strategies against biofilm-based infections will be also discussed. The articles will highlight both the recent advances and future challenges inherent in this rapidly evolving area...|$|R
30|$|Worldwide, the {{frequency}} of edentulism over 65  years of age fluctuates considerably between countries (26 % in the USA, 19 % in Italy, and 46 % in the United Kingdom, to name but a few) (Petersen and Yamamoto 2005). In France, the prevalence of edentulism continues to increase in the population, from 16.3 % in 1995 to 23.8 % in 2004 (Haute Autorité de Santé 2006), {{and it is a}} phenomenon that can be partially explained by population ageing. No data is available on the proportion of partially edentate persons, which would further increase the previous percentage if taken into account. Prosthetic treatment with removable dentures (RD) represents one of the therapeutic treatments available against tooth loss, and it is also that used most frequently. Esthetics <b>and</b> <b>oral</b> functions such as phonation and mastication should be restored (Roumanas 2009) following RD placement and patients should recover “good” oral health. The definition of oral health {{is not limited to the}} absence of pathology. Just as the World Health Organization’s states that “health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (World Health Organisation 1948), oral health is defined as a “state of being free from mouth <b>and</b> facial pain, <b>oral</b> <b>and</b> <b>throat</b> cancer, <b>oral</b> <b>infection</b> <b>and</b> sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual’s capacity for biting, chewing, smiling and speaking, and their psychosocial well-being” (World Health Organisation 2012). In the case of tooth loss, rehabilitation of oral health by wearing an RD does not allow patients to return to a state of oral health as defined above. Indeed, the literature showed that oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) measured using the “Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index” (GOHAI) (Atchison et al. 1998) remained deteriorated in the presence of RD (Locker and Miller 1994; McGrath and Bedi 2001; John et al. 2004). Similar results were shown using the shortened version of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14) and OHIP-edent questionnaires (Pistorius et al. 2013; Peršić and Čelebić 2015; Yen et al. 2015). RD renewal is often suggested to solve patients’ discomfort and grievances, and/or denture wear. However, few data are available on the impact of RD renewal on patients’ OHRQoL and their RD-related satisfaction, and existing data mainly focus on bi-maxillary complete RD (Veyrune et al. 2005). Moreover, in France, the evaluation of practice has recently become a key objective within university hospitals and private practices, in order to improve the quality of health care. In this context, the evaluation of RD renewal would undoubtedly contribute to improving the quality of oral health care. Such evaluation remains difficult, especially for prosthetics rehabilitation, because of the wide variety of existing processes. It has therefore been decided to focus on patient-centered outcomes, as done by Donabedian (2005).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{determine}} cost {{of therapy}} to patients of Ear Nose <b>and</b> <b>Throat</b> <b>infections</b> in a Nigerian teaching hospital. A retrospective drug utilization evaluation {{in conjunction with}} Cost of Illness Analysis was used. One hundred and twenty two (122) randomly selected case notes containing 182 prescriptions of patients with Ear, Nose <b>and</b> <b>Throat</b> <b>infections</b> over one year period between year 2005 and 2006 were examined. Relevant data including demographics, diagnosis, prescribed drugs, and dosages were extracted and the associated costs; direct and indirect were evaluated. Disease occurrence was significantly higher among children of age group 0 - 10 years (59. 3 %). Otitis media was the most prevalent and occurred among 82 (45. 0 %) patients followed by bronchopneumonia which occurred among 70 (38. 5 %) patients. The overall average antibacterial cost of ENT infections per patient (n= 122) was NGN 2940. 49 (US$ 22. 62). Bronchopneumonia and otitis media; the most frequent had average antibacterial costs per patient of NGN 3675. 41 (US$ 28. 27) and NGN 823. 27 (US$ 6. 33) respectively. Antibacterial cost for bronchopneumonia represents 71. 7 % of the total antibacterial cost. Bronchopneumonia has the highest overall average cost of therapy of NGN 5028. 88 ± 1393. 50 (US$ 36. 68). Antibacterial cost constitute the highest cost component (64. 37 %) followed by indirect cost (loss productivity) of (18. 50 %).

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} of severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in many Western countries. In Hong Kong, a similar increase has also been observed in recent years. One hundred seven GAS isolates collected from 1995 to 1998 from individuals with necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, meningitis, or other type of bacteremic sepsis (invasive group, n = 24) as well as from individuals with minor skin <b>and</b> <b>throat</b> <b>infections</b> (noninvasive group, n = 83) were characterized through serologic and/or emm sequence typing. Thirty-two M protein gene sequence types were identified. Types M 1, M 4, and M 12 were the most prevalent in both the invasive group and the noninvasive group; together they accounted for 70. 8 and 37. 3 % of the isolates, respectively. No clear pattern of skin <b>and</b> <b>throat</b> <b>infection</b> M types was observed. Type M 1 was overrepresented in the invasive and pharyngeal isolates. The same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern was shared by most invasive and all pharyngeal M 1 isolates. Overall, resistance to erythromycin (32 %) and tetracycline (53 %) was high, but M 1 isolates were significantly less likely to have resistance to either antimicrobial agent than non-M 1 isolates. One novel emm sequence type, stHK, was identified in an isolate from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis. Minor emm gene sequence alterations were noted for 31 isolates, and for 13 of these isolates, deletion, insertion, or point mutations were seen in the hypervariable 50 N-terminal residues. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Background. People with {{a history}} of rheumatic fever (RF) are at high risk of {{recurrent}} attacks and of developing rheumatic heart disease following a streptococcal <b>throat</b> <b>infection.</b> Giving penicillin to these people can prevent recurrent attacks of RF and subsequent rheumatic heart disease. However, there is no agreement on the most effective method of giving penicillin. Objectives. To assess the effects of different penicillin regimens and formulations for preventing streptococcal infection and RF recurrence. Search strategy. We searched the Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2001), Medline (January 1966 - July 2000), Embase (January 1985 - July 2000), reference lists of articles, and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria. Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing: (i) oral with intramuscular penicillin; and (ii) 2 - or 3 -weekly with 4 -weekly intramuscular penicillin in patients with previous RF. Data collection and analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results. Six studies were included (1 707 patients). Data were not pooled because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the trials. Four trials (1 098 patients) compared intramuscular with <b>oral</b> penicillin <b>and</b> all showed that intramuscular penicillin was more effective in reducing RF recurrence <b>and</b> streptococcal <b>throat</b> <b>infections</b> than <b>oral</b> penicillin. One trial (360 patients) compared 2 -weekly with 4 -weekly intramuscular penicillin. Penicillin given every 2 weeks was better at reducing RF recurrence (relative risk (RR) 0. 52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 33 - 0. 83) <b>and</b> streptococcal <b>throat</b> <b>infections</b> (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI: 0. 42 - 0. 85).
