5|$|Damage to the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> (III) {{can cause}} double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E

5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve,</b> which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases.

Rarer symptoms are double vision (<b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve,</b> trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. Prospective surveys show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E

40|$|Congenital {{fibrosis}} of extraocular muscles (CFEOM) is a {{group of}} neurologic maldevelopmental disorders that primarily involve the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerves</b> and nuclei or the trochlear nerves and nuclei or both with secondary abnormal-ities in the correspondingly innervated muscles [1]. CFEOM can be clinically classified into four major categories and several respective subtypes according to its genetic compo-nents. Of these, CFEOM type 1 (CFEOM 1; MIM 135700) and CFEOM type 3 (CFEOM 3; MIM 600638; MIM 609384) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The diagnosis of CFEOM is usually supported by clinical and genetic findings. CFEOM 1, known as the classic form of CFEOM, is typified by congenital non-progressive bilateral external ophthalmoplegia manifesting restricted vertical and horizontal ocular motility and ptosis leading to droopy eyelids and the chin-up position of the head [2]. These phenotypes were generally believed to be the consequences of dysplasia of the <b>oculomotor</b> nucleus and <b>nerve</b> and its innervated muscles (superior, medial, and inferior rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris) [3]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a routine means of clearly showing the functional anatomy of associated cranial nerves and nuclei and extraocular muscles (EOMs) in the orbits of patients with CFEOM [4]. For patients with CFEOM 1, the atrophic levator palpebrae superioris and other EOMs as well as the hypoplastic <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerves</b> can be detected with MRI...|$|R

500|$|The cell {{bodies of}} many of the neurons of most of the cranial nerves are {{contained}} in one or more nuclei in the brainstem. [...] These nuclei are important relative to cranial nerve dysfunction because damage to these nuclei such as from a stroke or trauma can mimic damage to one or more branches of a cranial nerve. [...] In terms of specific cranial nerve nuclei, the midbrain of the brainstem has the nuclei of the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and the medulla has the nuclei of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII).

This palsy presents as deviation of the eye to a [...] "down and out" [...] position due to loss of innervation to all ocular motility muscles except for the lateral rectus (innervated by abducens nerve (a.k.a.

2500|$|Duane {{syndrome}} is most probably a miswiring {{of the eye}} muscles, causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldn't and other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Alexandrakis and Saunders found that {{in most cases the}} abducens nucleus and nerve are absent or hypoplastic, and the lateral rectus muscle is innervated by a branch of the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve.</b> This view is supported by the earlier work of Hotchkiss et al. who reported on the autopsy findings of two patients with Duane's syndrome. In both cases the sixth cranial nerve nucleus and nerve was absent, and the lateral rectus muscle was innervated by the inferior division of the third or <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve.</b> This misdirection of nerve fibres results in opposing muscles being innervated by the same nerve. Thus, on attempted abduction, stimulation of the lateral rectus via the <b>oculomotor</b> <b>nerve</b> will be accompanied by stimulation of the opposing medial rectus via the same nerve; a muscle which works to adduct the eye. Thus, co-contraction of the muscles takes place, limiting the amount of movement achievable and also resulting in retraction of the eye into the socket. They also noticed mechanical factors and considered them secondary to loss of innervation: During corrective surgery fibrous attachments have been found connecting the horizontal recti and the orbital walls and fibrosis of the lateral rectus has been confirmed by biopsy. This fibrosis can result in the lateral rectus being 'tight' and acting as a tether or leash. [...] Co-contraction of the medial and lateral recti allows the globe to slip up or down under the tight lateral rectus producing the up and down shoots characteristic of the condition.|$|E
