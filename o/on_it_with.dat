5|$|The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Hall of Fame is an American {{professional}} wrestling {{hall of fame}} {{maintained by}} the NWA. It was established in 2005 to honor select wrestling personalities, mostly alumni of the NWA. Inductees receive commemorative medals that have their names inscribed <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the logo of the NWA.|$|E
5|$|Absolute {{structured}} {{the song}} using doo-wop records as a template. The format was for Emma Bunton {{to sing the}} high part, Melanie Brown, Victoria Beckham, and Halliwell singing the lower and middle parts, and Chisholm adding the ad-libs. The song was recorded in a caravan {{in the middle of}} mayhem. Wilson and Watkins doggedly worked <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> whichever of the group's members were available from the filming set at any given point. A considerable amount of production work was required afterward before the track reached its final form.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{strictly}} a missing serial, {{production of the}} 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician's strike partway through recording. To prevent the half-finished material from being junked, incoming Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner placed a preservation order <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> an intention to later finish the production. Although repeated attempts to remount the serial failed, a clip from Episode 1 was later used in the 1983 story The Five Doctors after Tom Baker declined to reprise his role.|$|E

5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above the other at {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening {{in the form of}} a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{intensified}} after Essad's exile. In {{order to}} gain support from the 1,000 Mirdita Catholic paid volunteers from the northern mountains, Prince of Wied appointed their leader, Prênk Bibë Doda, as foreign minister. Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, also joined the International Gendarmerie to fight the rebels. Dutch gendarmes together with the Mirdita attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged on May23, they were surrounded and captured, along with another expedition from Durrës which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Captain Sar {{did not know that}} the northern Catholic tribes refused to fight the rebels because General Besa was agreed when the Prince of Wied took over the throne. Rebels attacked Durrës, firing <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> light weapons. The people in Durrës panicked, and the Prince took his family to shelter in an Italian ship anchored in the bay.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs {{a hole in the}} ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the {{entrance}} to the hole, while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E

Most of the songs were romantic ballads, though he sang pop, gospel, and country songs as well.|$|E
25|$|John and Dino Elefante formed {{their own}} record label, Pakaderm. Most {{of the music}} they {{produced}} on in the next 10 years was released <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> major distribution through Word Records and A Records, Pakaderm became {{an important element in}} the brothers' success. Their label afforded them and their artists significant creative control, while still benefiting from major label resources.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous prefer thick {{branches}} {{on which}} to roost as they do not clutch the branch with their toes, but rest <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> folded legs. They will reuse the same locations and avoid defecating nearby to avoid advertising the roost site to predators. The smaller forest species, along with the steppe tinamous, will roost on the ground, sometimes in the shelter of a bush. They will also use the same location repeatedly; known examples are the elegant crested and ornate tinamous.|$|E

25|$|The {{idealized}} ruler, {{known as}} a straightedge, {{is assumed to be}} infinite in length, and has no markings <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> only one edge. The compass is assumed to collapse when lifted from the page, so may not be directly used to transfer distances. (This is an unimportant restriction since, using a multi-step procedure, a distance can be transferred even with collapsing compass; see compass equivalence theorem.) More formally, the only permissible constructions are those granted by Euclid's first three postulates.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{parliamentary}} procedure, {{the usual}} practice {{is having a}} proposal first, then discussion on this proposal with any modifications to it, and finally a vote <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> majority vote deciding the issue {{if there are any}} disagreements. An alternative to this process is consensus decision-making. In this alternative, discussion of potential proposals is held first, followed by the framing of a proposal, and then modifying it until the group reaches a consensus, when {{there is no longer any}} disagreement.|$|E
25|$|In South Korea, barber's poles {{are used}} both for actual barbershops and for brothels. Brothels {{disguised}} as barbershops, {{referred to as}} 이발소 (ibalso) or 미용실 (miyongsil), {{are more likely to}} use two poles next to each other, often spinning in opposite directions, though the use of a single pole for the same reason is also quite common. Actual barbershops, or 미용실 (miyongsil), {{are more likely to be}} hair salons; to avoid confusion, they will usually use a pole that shows a picture of a woman with flowing hair <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the words hair salon written on the pole.|$|E

25|$|In a {{graphical}} user interface, {{the appearance}} of a mouse cursor may change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the user activates the link (e.g. by clicking <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the mouse) the browser will display the target of the link. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another program may be activated to open the file.|$|E

He renamed it Montresor's Island and lived <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his wife until the Revolutionary War {{forced him to}} deploy. During the Revolutionary War, both islands hosted military posts for the British military. The British used his island to launch amphibious attacks on Manhattan, and Montresor's house there was burned in 1777. He resigned his commission and returned to England in 1778, but retained ownership of the island until the British evacuated the city in 1783 and it was confiscated.|$|E
