A prototype of Cloud Distributed Intrusion Detection System (CDIDS) is discussed with some basic experiments. The summation of security alerts has been applied which helps to detect distributed attacks while keeping the false positive at the minimum. Using the summation of security alerts mechanism the attacks that have slow iteration rate are detected at an early stage. The objective of our work is to propose a Security Management System (SMS) that can detect malicious activities {{as early as possible}} and camouflaging of attacks under the conditions when <b>other</b> <b>security</b> <b>management</b> systems become unstable due to intense events of attacks...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSecurity pattern-based {{system and}} {{software}} engineering (PBSE) approaches aim at building secure software and systems by capturing and reusing artifacts that encapsulate security expert's knowledge called security patterns. In this context, security patterns are selected by developers based on security requirements. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> is an iterative approach that consists of: (1) {{a risk assessment}} activity for identifying, analyzing and evaluating security risks and (2) a risk treatment activity to mitigate these risks which result in issuing security requirements. Hence, risk <b>management</b> and <b>security</b> PBSE can be used together. In this context, this paper aims at guiding the selection of security patterns in security PBSE based on <b>security</b> risk <b>management</b> results and pattern classification.

Approach: The study was restricted to Large, Medium and Small scale industries located in Tamilnadu, Kerala, Pondycherry, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh states of India. The data have been randomly collected from 45 samples each from Large, Medium and Small scale industries. This study has taken into the account of 6 major elements namely management commitment, documentation, facilities, promotion, procedure and training and each major elements having 6 sub elements thus consisting of 36 sub elements of safety management systems and 36 sub elements of <b>security</b> <b>management</b> systems. The sub-elements are prepared such as to reflect the availability of the safety and <b>security</b> <b>management</b> system in industries. Results: Major accident hazard industries require more attention towards safety and <b>security</b> <b>management</b> systems. The safety management system has gained more prevalence than <b>security</b> <b>management</b> system in large scale industries than the medium and small scale industries. The safety management system has considerable prevalence than <b>security</b> <b>management</b> system in medium scale industries than the small scale industries.

40|$|In recent years, the {{researchers}} have emphasized on positive effect of information system on supply chain performance such as organizational processes integration, information sharing, information technology, etc. In <b>other</b> hand, information <b>security</b> <b>management</b> system {{is one of the}} subjects that researches considered its effects on increase accuracy and effective information exchange, access to accurate and timely information and reduce errors of information system. Since, any research has not been done on this ground (the importance of ISMS on supply chain performance). Therefore, it was felt that a research should have done on these approaches on supply chain. In this respect, current research was seeking that how ISMS had impact on supply chain performance in automotive industry and this was the innovative aspect of this paper. So first of all, after the review of the information <b>security</b> <b>management</b> system literature, supply chain performance was considered by the balanced scorecard approach then the most important factors of these two subjects was extracted by correlation analysis. In this way, it was considered that how ISMS had impact on supply chain performance by correlation analysis. The results showed that different dimensions of ISMS (information uniformity, prevent the human and machine mistake, information be accuracy, and rectitude and instruction for users) had impact on four dimensions of supply chain performance (customers, financial, internal processes and learning and growth) in three levels (strategic, technical, and operational) in supply chain. At the end, it was showed that ISMS lays the ground for increase supply chain performance...|$|R

To do so, we analyze the processes of security awareness and <b>security</b> <b>management</b> using a process analysis framework and we explore their interactions.
