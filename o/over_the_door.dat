5|$|Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a {{horseshoe}} to the Devil's foot when he {{was asked}} to re-shoe the Devil's cloven hoof. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.|$|E
5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple {{is one of}} the Parashurameshvara {{group of}} temples, {{considered}} to be the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar. Some historians believe Parashurameshvara Temple to have been built in the early 8th century CE., subsequent to the construction of the Satruguneswar, Bharateswar and Lakshmaneswar temples in the late 7th century, although K.C.Panigrahi places the date as 650 CE. Fergusson believed that the temple might have been initiated at around 500 CE. A mid-7th century date is agreed by most scholars based on style and the presence of the eight planets which appear <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the inner sanctum as the later temples portray nine.|$|E

5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E

25|$|Benjamin Disraeli, {{who lived}} at nearby Hughenden Manor, was {{defeated}} as an independent candidate in 1832, but won election in 1868 and 1874-1880 as a Conservative.

25|$|The subject {{seems to}} first appear in art, unusually, in England, where a {{tympanum}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{of the church}} at Quenington in Gloucestershire of perhaps 1140 may be the earliest surviving depiction, and there is another in Reading, Berkshire. It was rapidly adopted and is prominent in the portals of French Gothic cathedrals such as Laon, Notre-Dame de Paris, Amiens and Reims, indeed most 13th century cathedrals in France.|$|E

25|$|The meeting {{hall was}} {{expanded}} and remodeled in 1845. At {{the beginning of}} 1859 that work was lost when it burned down. The current church was its replacement, although a marble commemorative plaque was not placed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> until 1872. A quarter-century later, in 1885, its original mahogany pulpit was replaced along with its white pews. The chapel was built the same year to accommodate smaller functions such as prayer gatherings and meetings {{of the board of}} trustees.|$|E
25|$|When {{the nearby}} village of Desertmartin held the county court of County Coleraine, all those {{condemned}} to die were executed or {{hung from a}} stone that projected out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the old Kilcronaghan parish church. This stone had a gutter cut to embrace the rope and prevent it from slipping from the stone during an execution. During the rebellion of 1641, in which Phelim O'Neill was engaged, and even in subsequent periods, the old Kilcronaghan parish church was still the scene of executions. The hanging stone was in 1806 built into the new church.|$|E

25|$|Haggs Castle is {{an altered}} L-plan tower, of 4 storeys. The main block {{measures}} around 17m by 7.2m. The vaulted basement contained two chambers and a {{kitchen with a}} large fireplace. The main stair {{led up to the}} first floor, where a private room was located behind the main hall. Smaller corbelled stairs led to the upper storeys, which included a square caphouse above the stair tower. Square and round gun loops were located around the tower. The most striking feature is the carved decoration, including cable-moulded string courses, moulded corbels, and the carving <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1171, {{the keep}} was {{constructed}} in the castle courtyard; {{during this period of}} the passive Reconquista, the keep served as the last defensive bastion, acting as the Lord lieutenants personal stronghold. At the conclusion of the project an inscription was carved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the keep, something promoted by D. Gualdim Pais in the medieval period, while in 1353, the castle and village were donated to the Order of Christ. The plaque was later removed and deposited in the Convent of Christ in Tomar Municipality, on request of Prince Henry the Navigator (between 1420 and 1460).|$|E

Between 25,000 and 55,000 people, {{at least half the}} population of Mantua, attended his funeral in a mile-long procession, with the coffin placed on a car chassis that was pushed by Alberto Ascari, Luigi Villoresi, and Juan Manuel Fangio. He is buried in the family tomb in the Cimitero Degli Angeli, on the road from Mantua to Cremona. The inscription <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> reads: 'Correrai Ancor Piu Veloce Per Le Vie Del Cielo’ (You will race faster still on the streets of heaven).|$|E
