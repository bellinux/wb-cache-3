25|$|Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal {{metabolite}} used experimentally {{to disrupt}} the secretion pathway {{as a method of}} testing Golgi function. BFA blocks the activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). ARFs are small GTPases which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding <b>of</b> <b>COPs</b> to endosomes and the Golgi. BFA inhibits the function of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs. Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} a standing posture during various activities, the center <b>of</b> pressure (<b>COP)</b> must be controlled {{in a specific}} area. This region {{was referred to as}} the movable area <b>of</b> <b>COP,</b> and was measured by shifting the center of gravity along the margin of the supporting area. The region was influenced by the supporting condition and the visual condition. Using a force platform we measured <b>COP</b> <b>of</b> 5 normal adults when stationary and the movable area <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> for 30 seconds under 6 conditions (supporting condition : legs 15 cm apart, closed legs together and one leg; visual condition : eyes open and eyes closed). The 3 -D histogram of the distribution of cumulated densities <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> was prepared and was compared with the movable area <b>of</b> <b>COP.</b> The results showed that under an easy standing condition, the movable area <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> was very large, COP was concentrated in the small area, and the densities <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> were high. As the standing condition became more difficult, the movable area <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> decreased, the scatter <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> widened, and the densities <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> decreased. Under very difficult standing conditions, the movable area <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> was almost as large as the area in which COP was scattered.

40|$|We {{compared}} postural {{control of}} expert gymnasts (G) {{to that of}} non-gymnasts (NG) during bipedal closed-eyes quiet standing using conventional and nonlinear dynamical measures of center <b>of</b> foot pressure (<b>COP)</b> trajectories. Earlier findings based on COP classical variables showed that gymnasts exhibited a better control of postural balance but only in demanding stances. We examined whether the effect of expertise in Gymnastic can be uncovered in less demanding stances, from {{the analysis of the}} dynamic patterns <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> trajectories. Three dependent variables were computed to describe the subject’s postural behavior: the variability <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> displacements (ACoP), the variability <b>of</b> the <b>COP</b> velocities (VCoP) and the sample entropy <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> (SEnCoP) to quantify COP regularity (i. e., predictability). Conventional analysis <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> trajectories showed that NG and G exhibited similar amount and control of postural sway, as indicated by similar ACoP and VCoP values observed in NG and G, respectively. These results suggest that the specialized balance training received by G may not transfer to less challenging balance conditions such as the bipedal eyes-closed stance condition used in the present experiment. Interestingly, nonlinear dynamical analysis <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> trajectories regarding COP regularity showed that G exhibited more irregular COP fluctuations relative to NG, as indicated by the higher SEnCoP values observed for the G than for the NG.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} gastrocnemius muscle fatigue on postural control ability in elderly people. Methods Twenty-four healthy elderly people participated in this study. The postural control ability of single leg standing was evaluated with Health Improvement & Management System (HIMS) posturography before and after fatiguing exercises. After evaluating initial postural control ability, the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of ankle plantarflexion was assessed using a surface electromyogram from the medial belly of the gastrocnemius muscle. After a 5 -minute resting period, subjects began submaximal isometric ankle plantarflexion (40 % MVC) until 40 % of MVC was dropped below 95 % for 5 seconds, or subject couldn’t continue working out due to muscle fatigue. And postural control ability was assessed after fatiguing exercise. The mean deviation of center <b>of</b> pressure (<b>COP),</b> length <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> movement, occupied area <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> were measured, and analyzed by paired t-test. Results Mediolateral deviation, length <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> movement, and area <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> occupied were increased after fatiguing exercise of the gastrocnemius muscle.

40|$|Arabidopsis COP 1 {{acts as a}} {{repressor}} of photomorphogenesis in darkness, {{and light}} stimuli abrogate the repressive ability and nuclear abundance <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1. COP 1 has three known structural modules: an N-terminal RING-finger, followed by a predicted coiled-coil and C-terminal WD- 40 repeats. A systematic study was undertaken to dissect the functional roles <b>of</b> these three <b>COP</b> 1 domains in light control of Arabidopsis seedling development. Our data suggest that COP 1 acts primarily as a homodimer, and probably dimerizes through the coiled-coil domain. The RING-finger and the coiled-coil domains can function independently as light-responsive modules mediating the light-controlled nucleocytoplasmic partitioning <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1. The C-terminal WD- 40 domain functions as an autonomous repressor module since the overexpression <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 mutant proteins with intact WD- 40 repeats are able to suppress photomorphogenic development.

40|$|In Arabidopsis thaliana, COP 1 is an {{essential}} element of light signal transduction acting downstream of photoreceptors and upstream of light-regulated gene expression. The COP 1 protein acts as part of an E 3 ligase complex to suppress photomorphogenic gene expression by ubiquitin-dependent degradation of light-regulated transcription factors. In dark-grown seedlings, the repression of photomorphogenesis involves the inhibition of hypocotyl growth, anthocyanin accumulation, expression of light-responsive genes, differentiation of etioplasts and prevention of apical hook formation. Loss <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 function leads to a pleiotropic phenotype comprising of constitutive photomorphogenesis in the dark and resulting in a post-germination growth arrest. The vegetative growth arrest <b>of</b> <b>cop</b> 1 mutants, a possible role <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 concerning the cell cycle and the molecular factors regulating the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 exemplify aspects <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 function and regulation that are poorly understood until now. This work aimed at the identification <b>of</b> regulators <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 -controlled morphogenesis to contribute to a better dissection of the latter. In yeast two hybrid screenings (YTH) 32 new interaction candidates for COP 1 were identified and a purpose oriented selection was performed. In order to select a putative regulator <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1, all COP 1 and additional DET 1 interaction candidates were integrated in a network of published interactors. Out of the network and the screening results PAP 2 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYAN PIGMENT) was identified and selected as a putative new target. MID (= MIDGET) was selected as a putative new regulator <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1, respectively. MID {{is a part of the}} topoisomerasis VI (TOPOVI) complex that is needed to complete more than two endocycles in plant cells. This work provides evidence for a physical interaction of MID and PAP 2 with COP 1. In addition, a new YTH-based domain mapping method was developed and used to identify so far unknown domains of PAP 2 for the interaction with COP 1 and for COP 1 for the interaction with MID and TOPOVI components. Similar to cop 1, mid and topoisomerase VI mutants exhibited all aspects of constitutive pohotomorphogenesis in the dark. Double mutant analysis indicated that MID is not a target <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1. In infiltrated leaves of Nicotiana benthamina, the presence of MID is needed for COP 1 to form a high number of subnuclear foci. MID and the TOPOVI were shown to be essential regulators <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 function probably by stabilising COP 1 and thereby adding a new cell-cycle related factor to the regulation <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 activity. The functional relevance of the MID-COP 1 interaction was proven by analysing phenotypes of the single mutants and genetic interaction. First evidence positioning MID in a SPA 1 and phyA-dependent complex or pathway were obtained by the verification of the SPA 1 -MID interaction via BiFC, co-purification of MID with phyA and analysis of the protein stability of MID depending on light quality. Finally it was found that mid and topoVI mutants phenocopy det 1 - 1 mutants and overexpressor lines of the C-termini of CRY 1 and CRY 2, possibly providing a new link to crosstalk between red and blue light mediated signaling...|$|R
40|$|FAR-RED INSENSITIVE 219 (FIN 219) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is {{involved}} in phytochrome A-mediated far-red (FR) light signaling. Previous genetic studies revealed that FIN 219 acts as an extragenic suppressor of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP 1). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the suppression <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 remains unknown. Here, we used a transgenic approach to study the regulation <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 by FIN 219. Transgenic seedlings containing ectopic expression of the FIN 219 amino (N) -terminal domain in wild-type Columbia (named NCox {{for the expression of}} the N-terminal coiled-coil domain and NTox for the N-terminal 300 -amino acid region) exhibited a dominant-negative long-hypocotyl phenotype under FR light, reflected as reduced photomorphogenic responses and altered levels <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY 5). Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that FIN 219 could interact with the WD- 40 domain <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 and with its N-terminal coiled-coil domain through its carboxyl-terminal domain. Further in vivo coimmunoprecipitation study confirms that FIN 219 interacts with COP 1 under continuous FR light. Studies of the double mutant fin 219 - 2 /cop 1 - 6 indicated that HY 5 stability requires FIN 219 under darkness and FR light. Moreover, FIN 219 levels positively regulated by phytochrome A can modulate the subcellular location <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 and are differentially regulated by various fluence rates of FR light. We conclude that the dominant-negative long-hypocotyl phenotype conferred by NCox and NTox in a wild-type background was caused by the misregulation <b>of</b> <b>COP</b> 1 binding with the carboxyl terminus of FIN 219. Our data provide a critical mechanism controlling the key repressor COP 1 in response to FR light...|$|R
