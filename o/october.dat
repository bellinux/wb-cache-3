5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea on <b>October</b> 8, and it persisted until <b>October</b> 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting {{in the development of a}} low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation's center late on <b>October</b> 12, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on <b>October</b> 13 off the north coast of Honduras. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on <b>October</b> 13, when it was assigned the name Irene. Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} organized into a tropical depression {{off the coast}} of Nicaragua on <b>October</b> 9. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm on <b>October</b> 10. Subsequent to crossing western Cuba, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late on <b>October</b> 12. It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary. Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early on <b>October</b> 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the frontal boundary on <b>October</b> 14.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} and an upper level trough interacted on <b>October</b> 10 {{to the south}} of Bermuda, and formed an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda on <b>October</b> 12, {{producing}} hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone on <b>October</b> 12 and a tropical cyclone on <b>October</b> 13. Karen strengthened to reach 80mph (130km/h) winds as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. It quickly became extratropical.|$|E

5|$|A deep low {{pressure}} system (with a pressure of 977mbar at its peak) {{moved across the}} Pacific Coast on <b>October</b> 15 and then crossed the Rockies during the following day and touched out some moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, major source for storm development and intensification. Not part of the main outbreak, 3 tornadoes were reported, during the overnight hours of <b>October</b> 16 towards <b>October</b> 17, across Randall County, Texas south of Amarillo on <b>October</b> 16 with 1 of them confirmed as a high EF1. That tornado caused damage to trees, fences, power poles, steel pipes, trailers and barns.|$|E
5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} <b>October</b> 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north. It gradually intensified and turned to the northeast, becoming a cyclonic storm on <b>October</b> 20. The storm became the second severe cyclonic storm of the season the following day, and turned onto a more northerly track towards the Ganges Delta. The storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of <b>October</b> 23. The storm then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on <b>October</b> 24.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on <b>October</b> 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on <b>October</b> 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on <b>October</b> 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on <b>October</b> 26.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly on {{the tail end of}} a cold front on <b>October</b> 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on <b>October</b> 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on <b>October</b> 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on <b>October</b> 17 as a tropical depression. No damage is known to have been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moving westward off the African coast on <b>October</b> 1, 2001 {{entered the}} tropical Atlantic. The wave's organization changed little until <b>October</b> 4 {{as it moved}} westward, when curved banding features began to increase. However, little improvement in the wave's organization occurred until <b>October</b> 6 after continuing to move westward for two days, when an {{area of low pressure}} was identified by the National Hurricane Center. Afterward, the cloudiness became more concentrated, and the system organized into a tropical depression by noon on <b>October</b> 6, shortly after the first advisory from the NHC was issued at 11 a.m. AST.|$|E

5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move west on <b>October</b> 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on <b>October</b> 10 as a Category 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on <b>October</b> 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on <b>October</b> 13 as a strong Category 1 hurricane on <b>October</b> 13, tracking north-northwestward.|$|E
