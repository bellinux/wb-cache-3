5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1884, {{the rivalry}} was played {{annually}} or bi-annually until 1889. All {{of the games}} were hosted at the Naval Academy. According to writers Taylor Baldwin Kiland and Jamie Howren, all games played during that time were hosted <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> parade or drill field was unused at the time at the Academy, instead of Navy having a specific football-dedicated area. The 1884 game, which was played entirely under the rules of rugby, was a rematch with Johns Hopkins. In the first half, Hopkins scored twice, on a touchdown from a Mr. Bonsall and on a two-point safety. Navy returned the favor {{in the second half}} of the game when halfback Julius Dashiell, brother of Hopkins' Paul Dashiell, kicked a five-point goal and rusher David W. Taylor scored a touchdown to secure a victory.|$|E

25|$|Although jumping spiders are {{generally}} carnivorous, many {{species have been}} known to include nectar in their diets, and one species, Bagheera kiplingi, feeds primarily on plant matter.

Logistics were a nightmare, relying <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> equipment was left over from World War I and could be captured. The Polish Army employed guns made in five countries, and rifles manufactured in six, each using different ammunition. Before the Battle of Warsaw the 1st Legions Infantry Division comprised three regiments, one of which was armed with German Mauser rifles, a second with French Lebel rifles (carbines), while the third used Russian Mosin–Nagant rifles. Each make of weapon took ammunition of a different caliber.|$|E
25|$|The main {{activity}} in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs {{to give each}} other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person {{in the role of}} counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.|$|E

25|$|Nanda {{was in a}} free fall. Over {{the next}} year, his power further {{deteriorated}} in the two remaining regions he still ruled: the Pegu province and the Irrawaddy delta. Most able bodied men had fled elsewhere. Minye Thihathu eyed Pegu for the city's enormous riches as well as access to maritime trade of Lower Burma. He entered into an alliance with King Raza II of Arakan. The allies agreed to a joint attack <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> remained of the empire, and share the spoils.

25|$|The {{music video}} for Manson's cover was {{a gateway to}} {{popularity}} for the band, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, and contains several clips of Manson and band members in {{what appears to be}} an old, decrepit asylum whilst wearing a variety of strange costumes. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: {{this was one of the}} first videos shot with director Dean Karr's initial vision intact, not based solely <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving dropping on his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing a cowboy hat whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song's climax.|$|E
25|$|The {{first nations}} guides turned for home {{as had been}} agreed, as did Wentzel, leaving Franklin with fifteen voyageurs and his four Britons. Franklin gave orders to those departing that caches of food were to be left on route and that most {{importantly}} Fort Enterprise be stocked with {{a large amount of}} dried meat. With the lateness of the season the latter point was crucial because Franklin now feared that if, as seemed likely, he failed to reach Repulse Bay, the sea would freeze and prevent him returning to the mouth of the Coppermine River. If so, he would be forced to make a direct return across the Barren Lands, where he and his men would be dependent <b>on</b> <b>whatever</b> food they could forage. There was therefore a real risk that they would be close to starvation {{by the time they reached}} Fort Enterprise; he frequently repeated that their survival would depend on the huts being well stocked.|$|E
