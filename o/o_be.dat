Malone refers to “Catastrophe … in the old sense … <b>o</b> <b>be</b> buried alive in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows what stuff he is made of.” The more obvious definition applies of course to the act of defiance itself; the effect {{is nothing less than}} catastrophic.|$|E

If some object <b>o</b> <b>is</b> faulty, <b>o</b> <b>is</b> rolled back to the checkpoint and ob- jects which have received messages from <b>o</b> <b>are</b> also required to be rolled back. In this paper, we define influential messages whose receivers are required to be rolled back if the senders are rolled back in the object-based computation model. By using the in- fluential messages, an object-based checkpoint (<b>O)</b> <b>is</b> defined to denote a semantically consistent global state of the system while being inconsistent with the traditional message-based definition. We show that less O-checkpoints are taken than the message-based ones. ...|$|R
