25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on <b>ocean</b> <b>freight</b> does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E

40|$|Competition {{conditions}} of shipping liners in marine container transport systems are gradually getting tough due to excessive fleet capacity supplied to the container shipping market. As {{a result of}} environmental regulative enforcement of international regulatory bodies and economy of scale requirements of cost-reductive operational strategies, spreading of ship size enlargement trends in shipping industry became a known fact. Thus, matching supply and demand in acceptable <b>ocean</b> <b>freights</b> became even more challenging. In this respect, container shipping liners considered significant changes on their strategic shipping alliances. For this they investigated the increase of mutual benefits among cooperative competitors in order {{to adapt to the}} dynamically changing system environment. More robust and wider shipping alliances are planned to share and reduce risks of owning oversupply, and increase quality of shipping services by aiming to meet demand expectations optimally. As a response of requirements for more robust and larger shipping alliances; three biggest ever shipping alliances in global marine container transport history have already been designed. In this paper, the authors aim to illustrate underlying competition dynamics of proposed new generation liner container shipping alliances. All other small alliances and standalone liner shipping services operating on the same network are disregarded. Deep sea liner container shipping market is treated as a triopoly supply market with heterogeneous players operating different fleet capacities. Game Theory methods are applied to analyse oligopolistic market competition dynamics in the marine container transport system. The actual developments on new generation shipping alliances and future strategies in the deep sea container shipping alliance game are addressed...|$|R

A growing number of surcharges are being imposed by the carriers on their customers, surcharges that are not only adding significant extra costs but are highly variable over time.

The paper compares the surcharges to the base rates and discusses some of the implications for shippers who face increasing uncertainty in planning supply chains. Some of the issues for academic research on freight rates is also examined {{and points to the}} need to clearly identify what is included in the freight rate data employed.

Communicating a weight value has called for the introduction of a new Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) communication protocol called VGM (Verified Gross Mass) or VERMAS (Verification of Mass), and involves cooperation between <b>ocean</b> carriers, <b>Freight</b> Forwarders/NVOCCs, EDI providers as well as exporters. The regulation states that exporters (shippers) are ultimately responsible to obtain a verified container weight.

5000|$|International <b>ocean</b> <b>freight</b> {{forwarders}} {{arranging for}} shipments {{to and from}} the US must be licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries. An Ocean Transportation Intermediary is either an <b>ocean</b> <b>freight</b> forwarder or a non-vessel-operating common carrier (NVOCC). An <b>ocean</b> <b>freight</b> forwarder is [...] "an individual or company in the United States that dispatches shipments from the United States via common carriers and books or otherwise arranges space for those shipments on behalf of shippers; <b>ocean</b> <b>freight</b> forwarders prepare and process documentation and perform related activities pertaining to shipments." [...] An NVOCC is [...] "a common carrier that holds itself out to the public to provide ocean transportation, issues its own bills of lading or equivalent documents, but does not operate the vessels that transport cargo"; or, [...] "a shipper in its relationship with the vessel-operating common carrier involved in the movement of cargo." [...] Companies may obtain both licenses and may act in both capacities. The U.S. legal distinction between the two is that a freight forwarder acts as the agent of a principal (typically a shipper or consignee) whereas the NVOCC is a transportation company (carrier) that is physically responsible for the carriage of goods and acts as its own principal. Companies acting strictly as an <b>Ocean</b> <b>Freight</b> Forwarder typically do not issue their own contract of carriage (bill of lading) and as agent are generally not liable for physical loss or damage to cargo except in cases of errors in judgment or paperwork or fiduciary responsibility. NVOCC s act as <b>ocean</b> <b>freight</b> carrier and issue their own bill of lading and are legally responsible for physical loss or damage in accordance with the terms and conditions of their bill of lading and tariff. Similar to other countries, freight forwarders that handle international air freight frequently obtain accreditation with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a cargo agent; however, they must obtain an Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) certification from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). If importing merchandise into the US for commercial purposes that are valued over $2,500, you will need to purchase a Customs Bond.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The fleet {{management}} problem, in its simplest form, involves managing fleets of equipment to meet customer requests as they evolve over time. The equipment might be containers which hold <b>freight</b> (<b>ocean</b> containers, truck trailers, boxcars), {{equipment such as}} locomotives, truck tractors, taxicabs or business jets (companies in the fractional jet ownership business may own up to 1, 000 jets). The equipment has to serve customers (people or freight) who typically want {{to move from one}} location to the next. We make the assumption throughout that a piece of equipment can serve one request at a time. One of the challenges of {{fleet management}} is that customer requests arrive randomly over time, often requiring service within a narrow interval.
