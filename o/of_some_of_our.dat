500|$|Michael Schumacher, who was {{involved}} in the first lap incident, believed that the race should have been stopped. However, he praised the work of the marshals who had assisted to recover the cars involved. He also believed that Zonta had [...] "over-estimated his ability" [...] and said he would have a [...] "quiet word" [...] with the latter. Zonta believed that the incident was not his fault and that Michael Schumacher braked harder than him, but apologised for his retirement from the race. Fisichella also agreed that the race should have been stopped, saying, [...] "Three of the protagonists are out and it was stupid not to red flag." [...] Benetton Technical Director Pat Symonds was highly critical of the driver's actions as he believed Benetton lost valuable points towards the Constructors' Championship. [...] "The driving antics <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> competitors at the first corner were appalling and ruined the race not only for many of the drivers but also for many of the spectators" [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|F-Zero GX and AX was {{the first}} {{significant}} video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. After Sega transited from first to third-party development in 2001, the two companies developed a close relationship and worked together on F-Zero GX and AX. Amusement Vision president, Toshihiro Nagoshi, was working on Super Monkey Ball for GameCube which opened up {{the opportunity for a}} collaboration between the two companies. Since Sega helped to develop Nintendo's Triforce arcade system, the company wanted to support it with software that would [...] "stand out and draw attention to Nintendo's platform." [...] Nagoshi was suggested to develop a driving game and agreed under the stipulation he could come up with something unique—which was working on the next installment in Nintendo's F-Zero series. During its development, Nagoshi focused on what he called the self-explanatory [...] "Interface" [...] of the game, and [...] "Rhythm"—to give the way the tracks are laid out a rhythmic feel. Miyamoto stated [...] " [...] have gained a lot of fans among current game developers, including famous producers like Mr. Nagoshi who grew up playing Nintendo games and are big fans <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> titles." [...] In 2002, Nagoshi claimed that 1991's F-Zero [...] "actually taught me what a game should be" [...] and that it served as an influence for him to create Daytona USA and other racing games. Before development started on F-Zero GX and AX, he mentioned abandoning the project due to personal pressures he faced to make a great impression on Nintendo and personal admiration of an established franchise. Still the announcement that Nintendo had handled development of one of its franchises to former competitor Sega came as a surprise to some critics.|$|E

His design work at this time moved away from private houses and consisted largely of unrealised designs for prefabricated mass housing in association with the Utrecht architect P. J. C. Klaarhamer. In 1919 he joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands and was active in arranging an exchange programme with artists in the Soviet Union, making his political stance clear in a letter to fellow communist Chris Beekman: [...] "I myself am convinced we will get a Soviet government, albeit that the transition will take a toll <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lives".|$|E

In May 1574 he joined Bishop Grindal, Sir Walter Mildmay, and Sir Thomas Smith {{in a letter}} to Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich, arguing in favour of the religious exercises known as [...] "prophesyings". But he was zealous in opposition to heresy, and in September 1581 he begged Burghley and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester to repress such [...] "anabaptisticall sectaries" [...] as members of the [...] "Family of Love", [...] "who do serve the turn of the papists". Writing to Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, 20 June 1584, he hotly condemned the archbishop's attempts to prosecute puritan preachers in the Court of High Commission as unjustly despotic, and treading [...] "the highway to the pope". He supported Cartwright with equal vehemence. On 24 May 1584 he sent to Burghley a bitter attack on [...] "the undermining ambition and covetousness <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> bishops", and on their persecutions of the puritans. Repeating his views in July 1586, he urged the banishment of all recusants and the exclusion from public offices of all who married recusants. In 1588 he charged Whitgift with endangering the queen's safety by his popish tyranny, and embodied his accusation {{in a series of articles}} which Whitgift characterised as a fond and scandalous syllogism.|$|E

Weakness and treachery caused a {{resumption}} {{of the war and}} the old English tactics of `divide and conquer' were exploited to the fullest extent. Partition was introduced, the country divided into two parts with two separate Parliaments subject to and controlled by the British Government. The armed forces of England still occupy six of our counties in the North and reserve the right `in time of war or strained relations' to reoccupy the ports which they have just evacuated {{in the southern part of}} Ireland. Ireland is still tied, as she has been for centuries past, to take part in England's wars. In the Six Counties, a large number of Republican soldiers are held prisoners by England. Further weakness on the part <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people, broken faith and make-believe, have postponed the enthronement of the living Republic, but the proclamation of Easter Week and the declaration of independence stand and must stand for ever. No man, no matter how far he has fallen away from his national faith, has dared to repudiate them. They constitute the rallying centre for the unbought manhood of Ireland in the fight that must be made to make them effective and to redeem the nation's self-respect that was abandoned by a section of our people in 1923." ...|$|E
