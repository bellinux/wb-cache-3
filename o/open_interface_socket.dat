30|$|In the mid 1990 s, the OpenSig approach[70] {{advocated}} {{both the}} separation of the data plane and the control plane for ATM networks and the usage of <b>open</b> <b>interfaces</b> for signalling between these two planes.

The OpenSig community actively worked on standardizing such an <b>open</b> <b>interface,</b> and a number of experimental networks set up in various research institutes explored these proposals. The Tempest framework[40], based on the OpenSig philosophy, allowed multiple control planes to simultaneously control a single network of ATM switches. The main reason of OpenSig approach could not quite become mainstream was the static nature of the interfaces it defined[14].|$|R
