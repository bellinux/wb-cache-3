5|$|Coming <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 {{campaign}} {{with the national}} team, Henry was ready {{to make an impact}} in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, {{by the fact that he}} had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{then lifted}} Laker for another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted {{for his ability}} to break {{partnerships}} with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by striking a four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the leg side with outfielders and bowled outside leg stump, challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg stump and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his bat onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at short fine leg.|$|E
5|$|Three hundred sixty {{five men}} and women served on Protecteur.

In 1988 the crew of the Protecteur was officially desegregated, allowing both {{men and women}} to serve on board her. Protecteur was equipped with a small dental clinic, which provided dental care for the Royal Canadian Navy when deployed.|$|E

[...] "$3.8 billion has been spent on reserve housing {{over the last decade}} and people think we're so privileged: living <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> everyone else in this country.  In my childhood, most of us were still hauling sewage out in pails." ...|$|R
5|$|The safety {{car pulled}} into the pit-lane {{at the end of}} the secondlap. Vettel {{retained}} his lead into the firstcorner, followed by Kovalainen, Webber, Rosberg and Massa. Kubica passed Heidfeld at the first chicane; Glock passed Alonso later in the lap. Vettel immediately opened a lead of twoseconds over Kovalainen; the McLaren driver experienced visibility problems as a result of the spray <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the Toro Rosso. Alonso regained seventh from Glock when he passed him at the first chicane on lapfour as the track began to dry. Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Coulthard on the same lap to take 12th and 13thpositions, respectively.

Emerging ahead of the Ferrari, he gave the place back, returning the advantage and avoiding a penalty. Glock spun on lapseven, losing oneplace to Kubica.|$|E

50|$|The {{eastern double-collared sunbird}} feeds {{alone or}} in pairs, or may join small flocks of mixed species, which are often led by the white-headed wood hoopoe (Phoeniculus bollei). It feeds on nectar, insects, spiders and small molluscs; the insects include flies, neuropterans and hymenopterans. Flying ants may be caught on the wing, prey {{invertebrates}} are picked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> leaves, and inflorescences are explored acrobatically to extract nectar.|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} been {{recorded}} foraging for insects flushed by grazing cattle and buffalo, {{in a manner similar}} cattle egrets, and has been observed fishing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> hippopotamuses. It has also been recorded feeding in association with banded mongooses; when a band of mongooses began hunting frogs in dried mud at the side of a pool of water a pair of hamerkops attended the feeding group, catching frogs that escaped the mongooses.|$|R

25|$|<b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> this heavy defeat, the New Zealanders {{produced}} one {{of their}} better performances, coming from a first-innings deficit to beat Gloucestershire by four wickets.

It is habituated to humans and its diet includes fruit, insects and nectar. It sometimes feeds on ectoparasites that it picks <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> animals and it sometimes visits bird tables for scraps.|$|R
25|$|When league {{football}} was resumed in 1946, United continued to struggle and finished that season 19th. However, thanks partly {{to the goals}} of their new striker Sammy Collins, the club broke the top ten barrier in 1949 {{for the very first}} time, finishing 9th and then 5th in 1950 <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Collin's goalscoring finesse.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} descent from the {{category}} 2 climb near the finish, the pace set by Française des Jeux and Lampre-Fondital {{at the front}} of the peloton, in an effort to catch Txurruka and Fédrigo, became so blisteringly fast that some riders willingly dropped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the peloton, knowing that by dropping off so close to the finish line they would not risk being disqualified.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} flew on a 150 {{degree course}} toward Benina Airfield. The craft radioed for a directional {{reading from the}} HF/DF station at Benina and received a reading of 330 degrees from Benina. The actions of the pilot in flying 440 miles into the desert, however, indicate the navigator probably took a reciprocal reading <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the radio directional loop antenna from a position beyond and south of Benina but 'on course'. The pilot flew into the desert, thinking he was still over the Mediterranean and {{on his way to}} Benina.|$|E
25|$|Rainbows are {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of internal reflection and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops. A single reflection <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.5° to 54° with violet on the outside. Because rainbows are seen with the sun 180° away from the centre of the rainbow, rainbows are more prominent the closer the sun is to the horizon.|$|R

South Africa arrived in England <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a successful winter which had seen them win series in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and draw one in India.

25|$|Half an hour {{into the}} final day, Warne finally turned the tide back in favour of the Australians and {{effectively}} sealed the victory.

Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling.
