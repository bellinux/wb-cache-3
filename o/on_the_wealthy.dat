5|$|Ralph Klein, {{the former}} mayor of Calgary, led the party into the 1993 election, {{promising}} a new era of debt reduction and fiscal accountability. He walked away with a slim majority. Ralph Klein's folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite low rates of taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him to pick a retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.|$|E

25|$|CBO {{reported}} that less progressive tax and transfer policies {{contributed to an}} increase in after-tax income inequality between 1979 and 2007. This indicates that more progressive income tax policies (e.g., higher income taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> and a higher earned-income tax credit) would reduce after-tax income inequality.|$|E
25|$|The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty {{recommend}} {{much higher}} top marginal tax rates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy,</b> up to 50 percent, or 70 percent or even 90 percent.

25|$|Progressive {{taxation}} {{based on}} decreasing marginal utility: The state should {{not try to}} offset all the inequalities of income and property by means of progressive taxation, but rather progressive taxation should be developed within the doctrine of diminishing marginal utility, i.e., every new tax adds a certain diminishing amount of utility. Thus, an unconscionable progressive tax, for example <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy,</b> would violate the spirit of privacy of Wieser's Social Economics.|$|E
25|$|Church stylings {{gradually}} {{show some}} difference between those where the landlords worshipped and their tenant counterparts. Early churches hosted both, with the oldest {{example in the}} district being the plain white frame Red Church along Route 9G in Red Hook, dating to {{the early years of}} the 19th century. Later <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> began building churches and chapels for their private or exclusive use, and these, such as the chapel on the Clarkson property on 9G, show more ornament than the older churches.|$|E

Heiress Victoria Lord and her extended family remained a prime focus until the series ended. Over the years many other families were introduced, {{most notably the}} Buchanan and the Cramer families, who intermarried with the Lords and also remained a fixture on One Life to Live until its end.|$|E

25|$|The People's Budget of 1909, {{championed by}} David Lloyd George and fellow liberal Winston Churchill, {{introduced}} unprecedented taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies. It {{was the first}} budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, incomes, and land, – taxation that disproportionately affected the rich – so that money could be made available for new welfare programmes {{as well as new}} battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his National Insurance Act, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his Unemployment Insurance Act.|$|E
25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on the {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.|$|E
25|$|Churchill also {{assisted}} in passing the People's Budget, becoming President of the Budget League, an organisation {{set up in}} response to the opposition's Budget Protest League. The budget included the introduction of new taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> to allow for the creation of new social welfare programmes. After the budget bill was passed by the Commons in 1909 it was vetoed by the House of Lords. The Liberals then fought and won two general elections in January and December 1910 to gain a mandate for their reforms. The budget was passed after the first election, and after the second election the Parliament Act 1911, for which Churchill also campaigned, was passed. In 1910, he was promoted to Home Secretary. His term was controversial after his responses to the Cambrian Colliery dispute, the Siege of Sidney Street and the suffragettes. The People's Budget attempted to introduce a heavy tax on land value, inspired by the economist and philosopher Henry George.|$|E
5|$|In August, Clinton {{signed the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts {{available}} to 90percent of small businesses, and raised taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthiest</b> 1.2percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated {{that the budget}} be balanced {{over a number of}} years through the implementation of spending restraints.|$|R

2500|$|Bennett was a {{supporter}} of a flat tax and also was a leading voice for {{the repeal of the}} inheritance tax, Alternative Minimum Tax and [...] "marriage penalty". He stated that it was unfair for the tax burden to fall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthiest</b> one percent of the population. Bennett voted against minimum wage increases and bills that would increase the ease in which workers could organize.|$|R
25|$|In the {{legislative}} session {{that ended in}} May 2013, Dayton pushed for and won a $2.1billion tax increase, mostly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> and cigarettes. He also signed a bill legalizing gay marriage in Minnesota, created free, statewide, all-day kindergarten and financed expansions of the Mayo Clinic, 3M and Mall of America. In the spring 2014 session, Dayton came under fire from supporters and foes alike for opposing the legalization of medical marijuana, which polls showed 65% of Minnesotans support. One supporter, {{the mother of a}} child with severe epilepsy, alleged Dayton told her in a meeting that he would not legalize the drug but she could buy the drug illegally instead. Dayton denied saying that. On April 2, Marijuana Policy Project began airing an ad across the state attacking Dayton's opposition to medical marijuana legalization, featuring a St. Paul mother and her child whose severe seizures could be cured by medical marijuana.|$|E
25|$|In 1252–59, Möngke {{conducted}} a census of the Mongol Empire, including Iran, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, Russia, Central Asia, and North China. While the census of China {{was completed in}} 1252, Novgorod in the far northwest was not counted until winter 1258–59. There was an uprising in Novgorod against Mongol rule in 1257, but Alexander Nevsky forced the city {{to submit to the}} Mongol census and taxation. The new census counted not only households but also the number of men aged 15–60 and the number of fields, livestock, vineyards, and orchards. Within the civilian register craftsmen were listed separately, while in the military registers auxiliary and regular households were distinguished. Clergy of the approved religions were separated and not counted. When the new register was completed, one copy was sent to Karakorum and one copy kept for the local administration. Möngke tried to create a fixed poll tax collected by imperial agents that could be forwarded to the needy units. Initially, the maximum rate was fixed at 10–11 gold dinars in the Middle East and 6–7 taels of silver in China. Protests from the landlord classes reduced this relatively low rate to 6–7 dinars and taels. Some officials raised the top rate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> of 500 dinars. While the reform did not lighten the tax burden, it made the payments more predictable. Even so, the census and the regressive taxation it facilitated sparked popular riots and resistance in the western districts.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set}} up that covered hollow ware making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and cotton embroidery, along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913 empowered local authorities to formulate tuberculosis schemes, while a Trade Union passed that same year clarified the legal position of trade unions while also restoring their political power, together with the financial position of the Labour Party. In 1914, Local Authorities received grants from the government to provide maternal and child welfare services. while the Criminal Justice Administration Act passed that same year compelled magistrates to allow for sufficient time to be made for paying fines. As noted by the historian C. P. Hill, this legislation was both merciful and economical, as it helped to reduce the prison population. The budget of 1914 brought greater progressivity into the taxation system by increasing levels of direct taxation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> while also investing more money in social services. The educational grant was increased, with money allocated towards the training of specialist teachers, schools for the deformed, grants for open-air schools for victims of tuberculosis, and further state provision for school-meal services. In addition, new provisions for maternity centres, sanitoria, and ancillary health services under the 1911 insurance bill were introduced, together with £4million in loans for local authority house-building.|$|E

500|$|After winning {{control of}} the state legislature, the DFL passed a $38 billion budget {{containing}} the tax hikes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> that Dayton had wanted in 2011. The shutdown still was a political issue in the 2014 elections, when gubernatorial candidates Zellers and Marty Seifert were among the candidates for statewide office who had been Republican legislators during the shutdown. Zellers claimed having [...] "balanced the budget without a tax increase" [...] during the shutdown was his signature accomplishment as speaker, but he was criticised by Republican rivals and DFL leaders alike for the shutdown and for the means by which the budget was balanced.|$|E
500|$|The tax cut {{extension}} for {{the remainder}} of the year was passed as the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 on February 17, 2012, by a vote of 293–132 in the House and 60–36 in the Senate. [...] The bill also contained a further extension of unemployment benefits and the Medicare reimbursement rates. [...] The cost of the tax cut was not offset by spending cuts, but the other provisions were offset by cuts in federal healthcare and pension programs. [...] Republican support for the bill was motivated by a desire to not oppose a tax cut in an election year. [...] Some Democrats criticized the bill for directing spending cuts at federal employees rather than generating funds by increasing taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> or closing tax loopholes.|$|E
