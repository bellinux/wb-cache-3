It {{allows the}} representation of multiple taxonomies over {{the same set of}} objects through viewpoints and provides tools for classification (identification) of objects and categorisation (classification) of classes from their descriptions. T-TREE is an extension of TROPES for the construction of taxonomies from objects. Data analysis algorithms consider TROPES objects for producing TROPES taxonomies.

40|$|AbstractGlobal Land Cover (GLC) {{information}} is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, {{and many other}} societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300 m and 1000 m, a 30 m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option {{for the next generation}} of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products. Over 10, 000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30 m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65 %) at global scale at 30 m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and <b>object-based</b> methods with <b>knowledge</b> (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i. e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80 % was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30 m resolution...|$|R

Separation of object definitions from rules that manipulate them in the knowledge base, and separation of the <b>object-based</b> <b>knowledge</b> base from the object-based inference engine that infers conditions, means that any changes made to any one of these components do not necessarily mean that changes to the other components have to be made, and also that each of these components is autonomous.

40|$|The {{notion of}} perspective, when {{supported}} in an <b>object-based</b> <b>knowledge</b> representation, can facilitate better abstractions of reality for modeling and simulation.

Additionally, the ability to record the progress of a process from start to finish is problematic. It is desirable to have a historic record of the entire process, not just the end result of the process.

Interface complexity is managed in a similar manner. Rather than have one generalized computer interface to access all information, the computer interface can be divided into interface elements. Interface elements can then be selected and arranged into a perspective-specific interface. This is done in a manner to facilitate completion of tasks contained in that perspective.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study how knowledge-based systems are applied in an industrial environment. This paper attempts to propose a system, <b>object-based</b> <b>knowledge</b> integration system (OBKIS) which supports the early stages of product development. Design/methodology/approach - This proposed system characterizes the "dynamic" information exchange capability through its distinct features to include executable tasks within product information script that is being utilized in various functional groups, thereby introducing the action items to be carried out in relevant areas. To achieve the "dynamic" information exchange capability, object technology, which is favorable to the creation of inter-related modularized data objects, is incorporated into the product information script to facilitate the active information interchange process. The universal extensible markup language (XML) is also adopted to facilitate data exchange between the database and the knowledge base in order to make real time data and knowledge available throughout the enterprise. Findings - Further research on developing the well-structured XML schema is needed in order to provide a well-understood syntax and self-defined mark-up language to suit particular needs of product data exchange. For verification and measurement, it is suggested that one should evaluate the system in terms of data reliability, transformation accuracy and effectiveness for improving product design process. Practical implications - The implications of these for information flows and management of product data during product development are discussed. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed system, a prototype is developed for a local company so as to provide linking between the system design concept and system implementation in a practical environment. Originality/value - The significance {{of this research is}} that a new product data schema for the initial phase of product development is formulated and the proposed system supports invoking various behaviors for the same message and overriding the pre-defined inherited operation such that a flexible correlation can be formulated in the iterative product design process.
