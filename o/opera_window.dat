25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an <b>opera</b> <b>window)</b> in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking <b>opera</b> <b>window.</b> Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{hatchback}} {{was dropped}} for 1980, {{as was the}} old three-speed manual transmission. Remaining Concord models were given a smoother appearance. The sedan versions of the D/L and Limited were given full vinyl roofs with nearly triangular opera windows embedded in the C-pillars; the coupe versions received squared off opera windows, and revised chrome <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> trim with vertical strakes occupying {{the space between the}} window itself and the outer piece of trim. Limited wagons received blackout paint and chrome trim surrounding their rear quarter windows. Base sedans and coupes retained the same rooflines and treatment seen on Hornets since 1970. Taillights were modified and given a wraparound treatment reminiscent of the old Hornet. All Concords received a new horizontal bar grille, with the Concord name in script to the driver's side, and a new, squared-off hood ornament bearing the AMC tri-color logo. That same year, options such as power windows and power seats were also made available.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in October 1977 in Australia, {{the first}} 200Bs were all fully {{imported}} in sedan, station wagon and coupe forms, the latter retaining the SSS badge. In January 1978 local assembly began for the sedan, followed shortly by the wagon. The sedan trim levels were GL and GX. While the coupe remained a hardtop, Datsun added an <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> {{in the rear}} pillar. The coupe was discontinued in Australia in 1979. The engine used is a larger version of the L series engine from the preceding 180B. Dubbed the L20B its capacity was increased to 1952cc, making it good for [...]|$|E
25|$|<b>Opera</b> <b>windows</b> {{had fallen}} into disuse by the mid-1980s, as {{changing}} automotive styles {{moved away from the}} upright notchback. Smaller, more aerodynamic cars made <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> appear gaudy or out of place. Contemporary examples of <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> are sometimes found on modified or customized automobiles.|$|R
2500|$|This {{design element}} was {{used during the}} {{classical}} era of automobile styling. For example, “...the Elcar in 1924 was good looking...and even a fabric top {{in the style of}} a brougham with oval <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> framed by landau bars.... <b>Opera</b> <b>windows</b> saw their demise in the 1930s. Perhaps the most notable return was the [...] "porthole" [...] in the 1956-57 Ford Thunderbird. It was provided as an option to improve rear-quarter visibility with the removable hardtop in place... <b>Opera</b> <b>windows</b> were once again reintroduced on the 1971 Cadillac Eldorado as a standard luxury feature.|$|R
25|$|Toyota Carina Van TA16V/19V (1975-1977) - {{perhaps the}} only wagon with <b>opera</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 Concord was [...] "the most luxurious {{of all the}} U.S. compacts". A new grille {{treatment}} was featured at the front. It consisted of chrome horizontal bars spaced further apart than in 1980, and added three vertical bars, one {{in the center and}} two outboard, dividing the two halves into quarters. Noryl wheel covers embodying a pseudo-starfish pattern were new to the options list. The <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> on two-door sedans was lightly redesigned as well. All AMCs were marketed as the [...] "Tough Americans" [...] in print and television advertisements, indicating the presence of fully galvanized steel bodies, aluminized exhausts, and the aforementioned of comprehensive Ziebart rust protection processes from the factory.|$|E
2500|$|All A-bodies, {{including}} the Grand Prix, were redesigned for 1973. This generation was larger and heavier, due partly to the federally mandated [...] crash bumpers. Although large V8s were still available, performance {{was on the}} decline due to another federal standard—a new emissions control system. The most notable styling feature of this generation was {{the appearance of the}} fixed <b>opera</b> <b>window,</b> replacing the previous disappearing rear side glass. This year's Grand Prix switched from pillarless hardtop design to a pillared [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop with frameless door glass as did all GM intermediates in response to proposed federal safety standards regarding roll-over protection that would have ultimately spelled the end of pillarless and convertible bodystyles, a mandate that never materialized.|$|E
2500|$|Detail {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} revised grilles and taillights along with new rear quarter windows for pillared and Holiday sedans – the latter's design similar to an <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> in September 1974. The same assortment of 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s were still offered {{along with a}} one-year-only (and seldom-ordered) option of a Pontiac-built 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and [...] rating. All engines were {{hooked up to a}} catalytic converter that not only mandated the use of unleaded gasoline but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems. 1975 was the final year for the Delta 88 Royale convertible, the last of which was built on June 11, 1975. Just under 7200 Delta 88 Royale convertibles were built in 1975 as Oldsmobile made a concerted effort to target the convertible buyer market at the time. The headline on a print ad for a 1975 Olds Delta 88 Royale convertible stated, [...] "Today a beautiful Olds convertible. Tomorrow, a collector's item". The featured car in the ad was a red Delta 88 Royale rag top.|$|E

25|$|The {{windows were}} {{intended}} to offset the significant blind spots created by the very wide C-pillars that were characteristic of American cars produced at this time. Even narrow <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> helped rear visibility. In an age of decreasing dimensions and increasingly common use of non-opening rear side windows on 2-door models, the small <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> helped rear passengers to be somewhat less claustrophobic.|$|R

25|$|New grilles and {{taillights}} {{along with}} a 5mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear <b>opera</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the {{committee}} {{agreed with the}} designers' recommendations: A design of compromise that included touches of both the old Town Car and Ford's new aerodynamic look. It would be rounder, but conservative touches, like rear <b>opera</b> <b>windows,</b> would be retained.|$|R
50|$|The <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> {{was mounted}} in this pillar and was {{surrounded}} by sheet metal, not touching either vinyl area. Three pieces of glass were mounted {{on each side of}} these cars; the Fairmont Futura had a very similar style, differing only in not using the center <b>opera</b> <b>window.</b> A comparable two-piece roof covering was available on the AMC Pacer that emphasized the bump in the roof that accommodated the roll bar over the passenger compartment.|$|E
50|$|Although Ford {{was unable}} to commit to a {{complete}} redesign, the 1975 Lincoln Continental saw a major restyling. Although the flat-sided fenders remained, the rear roofline was replaced with an upright design. Coupes were no longer hardtops, but pillared coupes with a square <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> in the C-pillar. In place of the Mercury-style pillared hardtop, four-door Continentals were given a roofline reminiscent of the Cadillac Sixty Special Brougham; Town Cars were given the oval <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> introduced on the Mark IV. Along with the styling upgrades, Lincoln made substantial upgrades to the braking system. Designed by Bendix, the Lincoln Continental {{became one of the}} first American cars equipped with a 4-wheel disc brake system (as an option). As catalytic converters are added, the 460 V8 no longer has leaded-fuel capability.|$|E
50|$|All Mark IVs were {{equipped}} with a vinyl roof. The Mark IV introduced the <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> to the Mark series, a feature that would be featured in the Mark through the discontinuation of the Mark VI after 1983. For 1972, it was an almost universally specified option, becoming standard for 1973.|$|E
50|$|The new Cougar paid {{homage to}} its smaller {{predecessor}} with a three-piece grille up front, {{topped by a}} new hood ornament which featured the Jaguar-like silhouette of a creeping Cougar. The car's Montego heritage was fairly evident from the sides on back. The Cougar acquired {{the sine qua non}} of the personal luxury car in the 1970s: <b>opera</b> <b>windows.</b> The <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> were rectangular shaped glass mounted in the C-pillars and accompanied by a standard partial rear section vinyl roof. This body ran unchanged for three years, and during this period all Cougars were XR-7s.The base model and convertible were dropped this year, but the XR-7 moniker soldiered on as the only model in the Cougar lineup.|$|R
2500|$|As all Matadors now {{received}} {{standard equipment}} that was formerly optional (e.g. power steering, automatic transmission), the [...] "Brougham" [...] package was dropped. Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with <b>opera</b> <b>windows,</b> and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.|$|R
50|$|New grilles and {{taillights}} {{along with}} a 5 mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear <b>opera</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1991 on, 99 {{units of}} the Touring Limousine with 24 in {{wheelbase}} extension were produced. The car was lengthened at the C-pillar with an <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> added, in a style reminiscent of Rolls-Royce's Phantom V and Phantom VI models. Like these earlier models, most of the cars had fold-down occasional seats in the rear passenger area.|$|E
50|$|The 1976 {{model year}} {{mid-size}} B-body 1976 Plymouth Fury saw very few appearance changes {{from the previous}} year other than the availability of a dual <b>opera</b> <b>window</b> roof on Sport Fury two-door models. Engine/transmission offerings were also unchanged except that the 360 two-barrel V8 was now the standard engine on station wagons along with the TorqueFlite automatic transmission, both items of which were optional on other models.|$|E
50|$|The Carroll Six {{was offered}} in both a two-door {{roadster}} model {{and as a}} four-door open touring sedan. The four-door had a distinctive black leather over steel California top, which was a non-folding hardtop with an <b>Opera</b> <b>window</b> in the C-pillar. The car was also unusual in that the radiator was placed ahead of the front axle. Two paint colors were available, Carroll Green and Carroll Red, each in two-tone finishes.|$|E
5000|$|As all Matadors now {{received}} {{standard equipment}} that was formerly optional (e.g. power steering, automatic transmission), the [...] "Brougham" [...] package was dropped. Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with <b>opera</b> <b>windows,</b> and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.|$|R
2500|$|Styling/engineering {{highlights}} {{through the}} years included disc brakes with audible wear indicators for 1972, a federally mandated [...] front bumper along with new vertical taillights in 1973, a stand-up hood ornament, 5mph rear bumper and optional fixed rear side <b>opera</b> <b>windows</b> in 1974 and rectangular headlights in 1975.|$|R
25|$|<b>Opera</b> <b>windows</b> {{are small}} {{porthole}} sized side {{windows in the}} C-pillar of some cars. Typically offered in unison with a vinyl roof, they were a very common design feature of American automobiles during the 1970s. The design {{would prove to be}} very popular, indicated by its imitation by almost every domestic manufacturer.|$|R
