5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances <b>of</b> <b>answering</b> each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley.|$|E

Since extension-based argumentation semantics were formalized in terms of relationships between atomic arguments, {{it has been shown that}} extension-based argumentation semantics based on admissi-ble sets such as stable semantics can be characterized in terms <b>of</b> <b>answer</b> sets. In this paper, we present an approach for characterizing SCC-recursive semantics in terms <b>of</b> <b>answer</b> set models. In particular, we will show a characterization of CF 2 in terms <b>of</b> <b>answer</b> set models. This result suggests that not only extension-based argumentation semantics based on admissible sets can be characterized in terms <b>of</b> <b>answer</b> sets; but also extension-based argumentation semantics based on Strongly Connected Components can be characterized in terms <b>of</b> <b>answer</b> sets...|$|R

25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead <b>of</b> <b>answering</b> {{questions}} in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the episode}} was {{promoted}} {{with the promise}} <b>of</b> <b>answering</b> questions, it caused increased media speculation.

40|$|International audienceConceptual graphs are a {{good choice}} for {{constructing}} and exploiting a knowledge base. In several of our projects (semantic portal for e-tourism, exploitation of digital object corpus, etc.), we have to query such bases. So it is natural to consider queries and bases as simple graphs and to compute the set of all projections from a query to a base. However, there is a problem of the return of this set of projections to the user. More generally, the main issue is about the definition of the notion <b>of</b> <b>answers</b> in an query-answering system made of knowledge bases formalized by graphs (Conceptual Graphs, RDF (Resource Description Framework), Topic Maps, etc.). In this paper, we study several notions <b>of</b> <b>answers</b> and some <b>of</b> their characterizations. We distinguish between notions <b>of</b> <b>answers</b> by subgraphs <b>of</b> the base and <b>answers</b> by creation <b>of</b> result graphs. For the last type <b>of</b> <b>answers,</b> we define completeness, non-redundancy and minimality criteria <b>of</b> the <b>answer</b> sets and propose several notions <b>of</b> <b>answers</b> w. r. t these criteria...|$|R

Even if the number <b>of</b> <b>answers</b> is manageable, distinct answers often have common submappings and if answers are enumerated, these structural dependencies are not made transparent.

[...] He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder.
