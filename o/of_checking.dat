5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> that his figures were correct. In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the market for}} checks using the monopoly problem as an approximation. The need for such an analysis arises due to the following policy proposal : the Turkish government considers increasing the lump-sum amount that drawee banks are legally responsible to pay per bad check. We show that banks will tend to restrict the quantity <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> {{as a response to}} such a policy action. We report that a percentage increase in banks' obligation per bad check could lead up to a 1. 7 % decline in the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> on the margin. We establish that the extent of the monopoly distortion depends on three main factors : (i) the elasticity <b>of</b> demand for <b>checks,</b> (ii) how fast the fraction <b>of</b> bad <b>checks</b> increase with the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks,</b> and (iii) the degree <b>of</b> preference heterogeneity. <b>Checks,</b> regulation, monopoly power, preference heterogeneity. ...|$|R

40|$|This study overturns the {{conclusion}} of a 1990 study by David Humphrey and Allen Berger, which found that check float is responsible for the popularity <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> despite their high resource cost compared to electronic payment instruments. The new study examines recent data on the costs <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> and automated clearinghouse (ACH) payments. It finds that the value <b>of</b> <b>check</b> float has decreased significantly since the 1990 study and is no longer large enough to make checks more attractive than ACH payments. The study also questions whether the idea that float could be responsible for the persistent use <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> is reasonable given standard assumptions about the behavior of economic agents. The study ends by speculating on why checks are used more than less-costly alternatives and by encouraging policymakers to wait for researchers to adequately answer that question before intervening in the market for payment instruments.

25|$|The {{money supply}} {{of a country}} is usually held to be {{the total amount of}} {{currency}} in circulation plus the total value <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> and savings deposits in the commercial banks in the country. In modern economies, relatively little of the money supply is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.|$|E

After the muster the recruits swore to obey the articles of war. They then received their weapons (and in later years also their uniforms) for which they had to reimburse their captains by a deduction of their wages.|$|E

25|$|Free Cell DNA can be run {{on certain}} antigens. Blood {{is taken from}} the mother, and using PCR, can detect the K, C, c, D, and E alleles of fetal DNA. This blood test is {{non-invasive}} to the fetus and is an easy way <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> antigen status and risk of HDN. Testing has proven very accurate and is routinely done in the UK at the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol. Sanequin laboratory in Amsterdam, Netherlands also performs this test. For US patients, blood may be sent to either of the labs. In the US, Sensigene is done by Sequenome to determine fetal D status. Sequenome does not accept insurance in the US, but US and Canadian patients have had insurance cover the testing done overseas.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{there are}} many {{families}} of graphs that are close enough analogues of formal languages {{that the concept of}} a calculus is quite easily and naturally extended to them. Indeed, many species of graphs arise as parse graphs in the syntactic analysis of the corresponding families of text structures. The exigencies of practical computation on formal languages frequently demand that text strings be converted into pointer structure renditions of parse graphs, simply as a matter <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> whether strings are well-formed formulas or not. Once this is done, {{there are many}} advantages to be gained from developing the graphical analogue of the calculus on strings. The mapping from strings to parse graphs is called parsing and the inverse mapping from parse graphs to strings is achieved by an operation that is called traversing the graph.|$|E
