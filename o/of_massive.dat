40|$|The {{central regions}} of galaxies show the {{presence}} <b>of</b> super <b>massive</b> black holes and/or very dense stellar clusters.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the propagation of}} very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays in the radiation field <b>of</b> the <b>massive</b> star <b>of</b> binary system Cen X- 3. VHE gammarays or electrons, injected by the compact object {{close to the surface}} <b>of</b> a <b>massive</b> companion, develop inverse Compton e ± pair (ICS) cascades. Based on the Monte Carlo simulations, we obtain the fraction of secondary cascade photons which collide with the surface <b>of</b> the <b>massive</b> companion in Cen X- 3 system. The distribution of photons falling on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>massive</b> star is investigated. These photons interact with the atmosphere of the star and should excite different γ-ray lines (nuclear, e ± annihilation line). We estimate that these γ-ray lines can be likely detected by the INTEGRAL telescopes. Key words: gamma-rays; propagation; massive binaries: Cen X- 3. 1...|$|R

5|$|Vesta, the next-most-massive {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after Ceres, is roughly spherical, deviating mainly because <b>of</b> <b>massive</b> impacts that formed Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater after it solidified.

5|$|During {{a tumultuous}} pioneer period {{characterized}} by its centrality in {{proximity to the}} Western United States, transportation in Omaha demanded the construction <b>of</b> <b>massive</b> warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with.

Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore.|$|E

Early in his presidency, Marcos initiated numerous infrastructure projects but was accused <b>of</b> <b>massive</b> corruption and embezzling {{billions of dollars in}} public funds. Nearing the end of his term, Marcos declared Martial Law on September 21, 1972. This period of his rule was characterized by political repression, censorship, and human rights violations but the US were steadfast in their support.|$|E

This gave rise to the growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13thcenturies, exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.|$|E
