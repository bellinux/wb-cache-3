Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best {{a few days before}} their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to a condom in their living quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had cut <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to their room).|$|E
5|$|While moving little near Puerto Rico, Emily brought {{prolonged}} {{tropical storm}} conditions to {{many parts of}} the island. The heaviest rainfall occurred in southern regions; Caguas recorded a total of 8.22in (209mm) of rain during the storm. High winds damaged an electrical grid, cutting <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to about 18,500customers; roughly 6,000people were left without drinking water during the storm. Dozens of residents evacuated to shelters, in particular those living near risk zones. Torrential rains of up to 10inches (250mm) overflowed three rivers, which resulted in the flooding and subsequent closure of the PR-31 highway and PRI-3 intersection. Throughout the island, multiple other roads were made impassable by landslides and fallen objects; infrastructural damage surmounted $5million, according to preliminary estimates. The two-day suspension of about 280,000employeesabout 30percent of the territory's workforceaffected the local economy significantly, with capital losses estimated at $55million.|$|E
5|$|A maximum {{wind gust}} of 158km/h (98mph) was {{recorded}} on Cairn Gorm, Scotland as Katia impacted the region, with a peak gust of 130km/h (81mph) observed at a non-mountain station in Capel Curig, Wales; these observations marked the strongest impact from a tropical cyclone since Hurricane Lili in 1996. Waves up to 15meters (49ft) battered the western coastline of Ireland, and fallen power lines temporarily disrupted DART services. Approximately 4,000 households were left without power across the country. A catering marquee was blown {{into the air}} on a set for the television series Game of Thrones, causing one injury. In County Durham, United Kingdom, a man was killed after a tree fell on the minivan he was driving; the passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A second driver was indirectly killed on the M54 motorway after hazardous weather caused a multi-car accident. Farther south in Bradford, an 11-year-old boy was injured after {{he was hit by}} a portion of a roof blown off a garage. Downed power poles set several fields on fire. The second stage of the Tour of Britain was forcefully canceled after strong winds littered the cycle route with debris. Following the storm, damage estimates in the United Kingdom alone topped £100m ($157 million 2011 USD). The remnants of Katia produced damage as far east as Russia. In St. Petersburg, wind gusts up to 45mph (75km/h) damaged buildings and left roughly 1,500 residents without power. In Estonia, the storm cut <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to approximately 940 households, particularly affecting the island of Hiiumaa and Harju County, with strong winds in coastal areas gusting up to 90km/h (55mph).|$|E

25|$|At {{the moment}} the {{stabilizer}} separated from the aircraft, the plane pitched downwards, headed straight for Belle Harbor.

The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a battery backup, cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground.

25|$|Floods from Mindulle's heavy {{rainfall}} submerged a tunnel along the Chūō Expressway in Tokyo. Portions of Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Yokota Air Base, and Camp Zama were flooded, with runways submerged. At Yokota Air Base, the floods cut <b>off</b> <b>power</b> to five housing towers, forcing the occupants to evacuate. Floodwaters covered roads and damaged homes in Hokkaido, {{and a man}} drowned in Kitami, days after floods from Kompasu also killed a man on Hokkaido. A woman in Sagamihara outside Tokyo also drowned during the storm. Nationwide, Mindulle's effects injured 61people. Across southeastern Honshu, 15rivers flooded, and a train line was washed out in western Tokyo, forcing a train of commuters to evacuate. High winds knocked a tree onto a central Tokyo train station, which suspended service on the Tokyo Loop Line. Fallen power lines left over 100,000people without power, mostly in Chiba Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|The {{floods and}} {{landslides}} heavily damaged roads in mountainous and isolated areas of Veracruz and Puebla states, forcing 1,700families {{to leave their}} homes to shelters. In Veracruz, the storm and the resultant landslides damaged 6,300homes and 26roadways, affecting 32,500people and killing 13. Floods isolated 18villages in the southern and central portion of the state. Sixty-six schools sustained varying degrees of damage. Landslides in northern Puebla killed at least 41people after several homes were covered. At least 10people were reported missing in the state. In Chicahuaxtla, landslides damaged 350homes and blocked roads to the village, cutting <b>off</b> <b>power</b> and water supply. The municipality of Huauchinango was hardest-hit after a month's worth of rain fell in approximately 24hours. At least 13peopled died in Huauchinango, including 7children. A landslide in Xaltepec killed 11people, and three fatalities occurred in Tlaola. Damage in Huauchinango exceeded 100million pesos (US$5.5million). The storm wrecked two bridges and damaged several highways in Puebla. In Hidalgo, one death also occurred, although {{the cause of death was}} not conclusively linked to Earl. At least ten homes were destroyed in the state. Total damage in Mexico is estimated to be at least US$132million.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the neutral section, the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the neutral section and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the neutral section to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut <b>off</b> <b>power</b> and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E
