5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> in the red crystalline mineral crocoite (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4).

50|$|The Berlin Conference is {{an example}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>world's</b> view on imperialism. The conference {{essential}} was <b>the</b> division <b>of</b> Africa among <b>Western</b> countries. <b>The</b> participating countries included Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, and others. Their goal was to address the struggle and competition for Africa. As if the continent was free property, Africa was divided up among <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1879, English law {{began to}} {{distinguish}} between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and {{by the middle of}} the 20th century, suicide had become legal in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>world.</b> The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>World,</b> led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E

5|$|Though Khrushchev's {{strategy}} {{failed to}} achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>world</b> to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.|$|E
5|$|With legal appeals, {{petitions}} from {{subjects and}} judicial queries of magistrates and governors, the emperors were careful {{to consult with}} the jurists (iuris consulti), who were usually secretaries drafted from the equestrian order. From the reign of Augustus (27BC–AD14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial edicts (constitutiones), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship {{gave rise to the}} earliest law school system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world,</b> aimed specifically at training professional jurists.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known coins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world</b> were minted in {{the kingdom}} of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the Indian rupee {{from the time of the}} Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges through the pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>World</b> newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who {{was found to be}} receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E

5000|$|Tomlinson {{points that}} the book offers an [...] "oppositional reading" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Disney comics, in order to reveal the ideological {{assumptions}} which inform the stories in question. The writers argued that the stories naturalized and normalized <b>the</b> social relations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>world's</b> capitalism. In summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book's thesis, the Disney comics served as an effort by American capitalism to persuade people that <b>the</b> American way <b>of</b> life was desirable, and that American superiority was both natural and in everyone's best interest.|$|R
