5|$|Harper was {{member of}} the House of Commons for the riding of Calgary Southwest in Alberta from 2002 to 2015 (and for Calgary Heritage till 2016). Earlier, from 1993 to 1997, he was the MP for Calgary West, {{representing}} the Reform Party of Canada. He {{was one of the}} founding members of the Reform Party, but did not seek re-election in the 1997 federal election. Harper instead joined and later led the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative lobbyist group. In 2002, he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance, the successor to the Reform Party and returned to parliament as Leader of the Opposition. In 2003, he reached an agreement with Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay for the merger <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada. He was elected as the party's first leader, in March 2004. Harper stepped down as MP on August 26, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Hermética was a thrash metal band, drawing {{influences}} from Motörhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their {{music was}} composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a counterpoint between the singing styles <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were high pitched, while Iorio had a raucous style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety. Iorio thought that his singing style in Hermética was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs {{had not been}} composed specifically for him. The success of Hermética's second studio album Ácido Argentino allowed the band to increase the budget {{for the production of}} its follow-up, Víctimas del Vaciamiento. Iorio proposed re-recording the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana {{was largely}} a yotsu-sumo wrestler, favouring {{techniques}} which involved grabbing his opponent's mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, a simple force out, which accounted for 52 percent of his victories. He also regularly employed uwatenage, or overarm throw, {{and this was the}} technique he used to defeat Asashōryū in the second <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> meetings, in September 2002.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine government's alarm {{continued}} under de Oca's successor, Estanislao Zeballos. In June 1908, Zeballos {{presented a}} plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: {{if they did not}} comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.|$|E

5|$|The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was {{deployed}} {{with its}} right flank at Huningue, its {{center on the}} Queich River and its left flank at Saarbrücken. The Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne, while the 22,000 men of its left wing under Jean-Baptiste Kléber held Düsseldorf. The French grand strategy designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> armies to turn the Austrian flanks. The strategic plan called for Jourdan to start by advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals. First, {{it was hoped that}} this would cause the Austrians to abandon {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. Second, the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau's army a better chance to cross the Rhine in the south.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Frenchman’s Creek {{took place}} during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States {{in the early hours of}} November 28, 1812, in the Crown Colony of Upper Canada, near the Niagara River. The {{operation}} was conceived as a raid to prepare the ground for a larger American invasion. The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing at both of their points of attack. They achieved one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off, rendering useless what had been accomplished. The engagement was named, “the Battle of Frenchman’s Creek” by the Canadians, after the location of some of the severest fighting. To contemporary Americans, it was known as, “the Affair opposite Black Rock”.|$|E

5|$|The Pilots' first Opening Day {{starting}} pitcher was Marty Pattin, {{who received the}} win in a 43 victory against the California Angels. After the team's move to Milwaukee in 1970, Lew Krausse Jr. was charged with the loss in a game at Milwaukee County Stadium vs. the Angels. Ben Sheets holds the club record for most Opening Day starts with six, from 2002 through 2005 and again in both 2007 and 2008. Sheets has a 30 record as a starter on Opening Day, the franchise's best record. Marty Pattin and Mike Caldwell also have perfect records; both won each <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> starts. The Brewers' 17 Opening Day losses by starters are distributed among 16 different pitchers, each having lost one game, excluding Yovani Gallardo, who has lost two.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act's chief {{objective}} was {{the reduction of}} the number of nomination boroughs. There were 203 boroughs in England before the Act. The 56 smallest of these, as measured by their housing stock and tax assessments, were completely abolished. The next 30 smallest boroughs each lost one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> MPs. In addition Weymouth and Melcombe Regis's four members were reduced to two. Thus in total the Act abolished 143 borough seats in England (one of the boroughs to be completely abolished, Higham Ferrers, had only a single representative).|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{reorganisation}} and training followed as the battalion {{was prepared for}} the rigours of jungle warfare. The battalion concentrated at the Nagambie Road Camp in central Victoria initially, but in late September moved to Greta in New South Wales. In October, {{after a period of}} intense training, the 2/6th was moved to Brisbane from where, on 13 October 1942, they embarked on the Dutch merchant ship Bontekoe, bound for Milne Bay for the first <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> campaigns there against the Japanese. After arriving at Milne Bay, where the 17th Brigade was held in reserve, on 19 October they remained there until January 1943, when the battalion embarked upon the MV Pulganbar and several smaller coastal vessels and moved to Port Moresby. From Moresby, they were airlifted to Wau on 14 January. During the battalion's time around Milne Bay, they had suffered heavily from malaria and over 300 men were in hospital at the time the battalion deployed to Wau; consequently, it was severely understrength by the time it went into battle. Nevertheless, throughout late January 1943, the battalion was heavily involved in the Battle of Wau, then afterwards took part in the advance on Salamaua, during which it fought several key actions, including the fighting around Lababia Ridge in late June, before supporting the landing at Nassau Bay and the Battle of Mubo in July and then taking part in the fighting around Mount Tambu and Komiatum Ridge in August. During the fighting the battalion sustained casualties of 59 dead and 133 wounded.|$|E
5|$|For Brazil, {{the result}} became one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> worst losses, equalling a 6–0 defeat to Uruguay in 1920, and was their worst-ever defeat at home; their {{previous}} worst defeat {{at home was}} a 5–1 defeat by Argentina in Rio de Janeiro in 1939. The loss broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches, dating back to their 1–3 loss to Peru in the 1975 Copa América; this match was also played at Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte. The last time Brazil had lost a World Cup semi-final was in 1938, in a dramatic game against Italy in Marseille, and had emerged victorious from this stage the previous six times they had reached it, since the loss in 1974 against Netherlands was not formally a semi-final. Brazil had never before conceded seven goals at home, although they once conceded eight goals in a 4–8 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934; {{the last time they}} conceded at least five was in a 6–5 win in the 1938 World Cup versus Poland; at least four was in a 2–4 defeat at the 1954 World Cup against Hungary. Brazil's previous largest losing deficit at the World Cup prior to the match was three goals, which came in the 0–3 defeat to France in the 1998 final. The game's outcome also marked Brazil's worst result against Germany, passing a 0–2 defeat in a 1986 friendly.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating a through route from Aylesbury to Oxford. If built, the line {{would have been the}} shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by the costly tunnelling proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed, in which the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid tunnelling. In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010–11 NHL season, Crosby had a 25-game point streak, {{which began}} November 5, 2010, against the Anaheim Ducks, and ended December 28, 2010, against the New York Islanders. During this streak he had 27 goals (including three hat-tricks), 24 assists, and 51 points. This streak was tied for 11th longest point streak in NHL history, {{and he was}} named First Star of the Month in both November and December. On January 3, 2011, Crosby was {{selected}} as a 2011 All-Star, along with teammates Evgeni Malkin, Marc-André Fleury, and Kris Letang. However, neither Crosby nor Malkin were available {{to play in the}} All-Star Game due to injuries and rookie Jeff Skinner along with Paul Stastny were named as replacements. In consecutive games — the 2011 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2011 against the Washington Capitals, and then January 5 against the Tampa Bay Lightning — Crosby suffered hits to his head from Dave Steckel and Victor Hedman, respectively. After experiencing several concussion symptoms, Crosby did not return {{for the rest of the}} regular season, and he missed the 2010–11 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Penguins were further crippled when Evgeni Malkin suffered a torn ACL and MCL, taking him out for the rest of the season. This left the Penguins without the services <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> highest scoring players. Despite Crosby's injury and subsequent absence for the final 41 games of the season, he finished as the Penguins' leading scorer. His 66 points in 41 games were 16 points ahead of the second highest team scorer, defenceman Kris Letang. In doing this, Crosby set an NHL record for fewest games played by an NHL team's points leader.|$|E
5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>two</b> chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E
