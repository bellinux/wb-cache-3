5|$|By tradition, {{the winner}} of the {{previous}} year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner {{at the end of the}} tournament.

5|$|St. Elmo is a 1914 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Balboa Amusement Producing Company and distributed by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company. It was the first feature-length film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. The story follows {{the life of the}} title character (played by William Jossey), who kills his cousin (Francis McDonald) over the love of Agnes (Madeline Pardee), falls from grace, and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna (Gypsy Abbott). It is disputed who directed the film; many sources credit Bertram Bracken, while others list St. Elmo as J. Gordon Edwards's directorial debut.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationships}} between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His {{mother and grandmother}} became the first women to be allowed into the Senate, and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of Clarissima, and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus ("Mother of the army camp and of the Senate"). They held the title <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> as well, suggesting {{that they may have}} been the power behind the throne. Indeed, they exercised great influence over the young emperor throughout his reign, and can be found on many coins and inscriptions—a rare honor for Roman women.|$|E
5|$|At the {{approach}} {{to the west of}} the important city <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry. In the ensuing battle Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious. Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312AD, when he moved on to Brixia (Brescia).|$|E
5|$|For two {{or three}} days, Rome {{remained}} without an emperor. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor and assumed all of the imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as emperor and the Senate, so far away, was powerless to intervene. Macrinus never returned to Rome as emperor and remained based in Antioch {{for the duration of}} his reign. Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command. At the time of Diadumenian's accession he was eight years old.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E
5|$|The western county <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> in Virginia {{could no}} longer {{serve the needs of}} the far flung pioneers along the New River, and so in 1769, the county of Botetourt was created. Trigg was one of several {{appointed}} as its first justices of the peace, which was a judge presiding over misdemeanors and other civil cases. From 1770 to 1771, he served as magistrate, Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, which was a criminal court. When the town of Fincastle, Virginia was forming in 1770, Trigg was instrumental in its development, helping to sell lots and build the town's prison along with a courthouse with his father-in-law, Israel Christian.|$|E
5|$|Under pretence of {{siding with}} Vespasian, Civilis of Batavia {{had taken up}} arms and induced the {{inhabitants}} of his native country to rebel. The rebelling Batavians were immediately joined by several neighbouring German tribes including the Frisii. These forces drove out the Roman garrisons near the Rhine and defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Castra Vetera, after which many Roman troops along the Rhine and in Gaul defected to the Batavian cause. However, disputes soon broke out amongst the different tribes, rendering co-operation impossible; Vespasian, having successfully ended the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on his refusal his legions met him in force, defeating him in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> Treverorum.|$|E

5|$|After his {{education}} was completed, Beverley returned to Virginia {{and began a}} career in public service. He was the Clerk of Court for Essex County for 29 years (1716–1745), when the first Essex County courthouse was on Beverley's Blandfield estate. Beverley was also an Essex County judge from 1720 to 1740. He {{was a member of}} the Virginia House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, elected to represent Orange (1736–1738) and Essex Counties (1742–1749). During his first term as Orange County burgess, Beverley served with Robert Green. He represented Essex County with James Ganett until 1747, after which he served with William Daingerfield until 1749. Beverley's appointment as county lieutenant and commander-in-chief of the militias <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> and Orange Counties in 1741 was confirmed in the Orange County Court on November 3, 1741. In 1750 he was appointed to the Virginia Governor's Council, the upper house of Virginia's colonial legislature, replacing John Custis IV (father-in-law of Martha Dandridge Custis). Beverley's appointment to the Governor's Council fulfilled an ambition which his father was unable to achieve.|$|E
5|$|In 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is {{not known}} what the boy's name was, but he died in {{childhood}} in 83. Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title <b>of</b> <b>Augusta</b> upon Domitia, while their son was deified, appearing as such on the reverse of coin types from this period. Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly exiled Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia. Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir. By 84, Domitia {{had returned to the}} palace, where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident. Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the amphitheatre, while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks of benefits he received from her. It {{is not known}} whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again. Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce, the marriage appears to have been happy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of McKinley's {{election}} in 1896, African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche K. Bruce, an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster <b>of</b> <b>Augusta,</b> Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.|$|E
