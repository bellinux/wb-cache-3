5|$|It {{is worth}} remembering that {{conducting}} detritylation {{for an extended}} time or with stronger than recommended solutions of acids leads to depurination of solid support-bound oligonucleotide and thus reduces the yield <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> full-length product.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> behavior.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E

The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> output waveform which typically is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed {{to reduce the amount}} of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages in place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Pierre Frugoli and Lucien Mattei opened on 30 November 1987 in Pau, France. Mattei, {{who had been}} {{previously}} been released after serving one year of a 20-year sentence for armed assault, retracted his previous confession. Frugoli, however, acknowledged that he had set out to kill ETA members. He stated {{that he had been}} recruited by members of the Spanish secret services, codenamed Francis and Miguel, in La Samaritaine bar in Marseilles port. With Mattei, he made several trips to San Sebastián to receive instructions for the attack, the last in the city's Orly Hotel three days before the attack. He claimed that Francis had offered him 100,000 francs for carrying out the attack and 50,000 more for each person killed. Francis then met them in Bayonne, supplying them with the weapons used in the attack and the identities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> signal.|$|E
