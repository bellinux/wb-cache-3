40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{genetic and}} environmental influences in multiple sclerosis (MS) by comparing age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> in 99 sibling pairs concordant for the disease. We used three methods of analysis: (1) comparison of mean differences in age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and year <b>of</b> <b>onset,</b> (2) linear regression {{of differences in}} age or year <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> vs difference in ages, and (3) intraclass correlation <b>of</b> age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> which is also used for monozygotic twins concordant for MS. Comparison of the mean differences in age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> or year <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> {{is found to be}} inappropriate and potentially misleading. No significant results were found in linear regression of the age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> or year <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> vs differences in ages, although a trend towards onset at the same age is present.

A stronger intraclass correlation in age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> in concordant monozygotic twins vs concordant sibling pairs further suggests that age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> is partly under genetic control, assuming common exposure to an environmental agent.

40|$|Cochlear implant (CI) {{recipients}} {{suffer from}} the inability to understand speech in adverse listening conditions like reverberant rooms or noisy environments but achieve good speech intelligibility (SI) performance in quiet environments. One approach to increase SI in CI patients is to enhance signal by applying noise reduction techniques or distorting the speech envelope {{in a way to}} improve SI. We follow the latter approach by enhancing the <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> the speech envelope to improve the access of CI users to this acoustical landmarks that were shown to be important for speech understanding in normal – hearing listeners. Therefore, an onset envelope enhancement strategy was developed that amplifies the <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> the speech signal in each frequency band. In this feasibility study, we investigated the influence <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> enhancement by comparing the EE with the reference advanced combined encoder (ACE) strategy with 6 CI users in stationary speech shaped noise (SSN) and in a competitive talker situation. The extraction <b>of</b> the <b>onsets</b> is done on the clean speech signal and the amplified onsets are than added to the noisy mixture of the signal. Hence, a priori knowledge is only used for the peak extraction. Additionally to the <b>onset</b> extraction <b>of</b> the target speaker signal, the <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> the competitive talker were also extracted from the clean interfering talker signal for the competitive talker task. Results of subjective listening tests with the Dutch LIST sentences showed an increase in speech intelligibility in comparison to the ACE strategy for all CI users in stationary SSN. An alaysis with a repeated measures ANOVA revealed that a significant effect of the factor strategy occurred. There were no other significant main or interaction effects obtained. The results of the competitive talker task, where a female speaker was used as a target speaker and a male as interfering speaker, showed an increase in the speech reception threshold for three different onset enhanced conditions: <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> the target speaker, <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> the target and interfering speaker,and <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> the noisy mixture enhanced. The increase in SI demonstrated the importance <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> cues for CI listeners on SI in adverse listening conditions. Due {{to the fact that the}} onset extraction was done on the clean speech signal, further research has to be done to extract the onset cues from the noisy mixture to make the algorithm applicable in noise. The competitive talker situation results suggest that there is a margin for errors in the onset extraction and enhancing the contrast to some extend between the target signal and the background is sufficient to increase SI. status: publishe...|$|R

DESIGN: This study uses data from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorder Study (CLPS), a prospective naturalistic study with reliable repeated measures over 7 years of follow-up. SETTING: Multiple clinical sites in four northeastern US cities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 175 patients with BPD and 396 patients with OPD (mean age 32. 5 years) were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months. MEASUREMENTS: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and the Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders were used at baseline, the Follow-Along version of the DIPD-IV and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation at the follow-up evaluations. Kaplan-Meier analyses were calculated to generate the time to new onsets. FINDINGS: BPD patients showed a shorter time to new <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> SUD. Thirteen per cent of BPD patients developed a new alcohol use disorder and 11 % developed a new drug use disorder, compared to rates of 6 % and 4 %, respectively, for OPD. Non-remitted BPD and remitted BPD patients did not differ significantly in rates <b>of</b> new <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> SUD. CONCLUSIONS: BPD patients have a high vulnerability for new <b>onsets</b> <b>of</b> SUDs even when their psychopathology improves. These findings indicate some shared etiological factors between BPD and SUD and underscore the clinical significance of treating SUD when it co-occurs in BPD patients...|$|R

40|$|Trabajo presentado a la 10 ª Reunión anual de la Sociedad Española de Investigación sobre Cannabinoides celebrada en Santander del 26 al 28 de noviembre de 2009. Introduction: Age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and {{duration}} <b>of</b> untreated Psychosis (DUP) {{have been proposed}} as key factors in the prognosis of psychosis. Whereas gender differences in age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> have been established {{and there is an}} emerging evidence of the association between cannabis use and an earlier age <b>of</b> <b>onset,</b> the role <b>of</b> other variables remains unclear. The Val 158 Met polymorphism of Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) has shown differences in clinical variables between genotypes and a possible association with an earlier age <b>of</b> <b>onset.</b> Additionally, an interaction between COMT genotype and cannabis has been previously found in the modulation of risk of psychosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of COMT genotype, cannabis and their interaction in the age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and DUP in a representative group of first episode psychosis patients. Methods: Aged <b>of</b> <b>onset,</b> DUP and cannabis consumption (regular user vs. sporadic or non-user) were assessed in 169 caucasian drug-naïve patients with a first-episode of non-affective psychosis. COMT polymorphism was typed using PCR of the relevant region followed by digestion with NlaIII and electrophoresis. A multivariate ANCOVA was performed with DUP and Age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> as dependent variables, cannabis and COMT genotype as fixed factors and gender as a covariate. Results: The MANCOVA was significant for age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and DUP. Cannabis users had a significant earlier age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> (F= 16. 887; p< 0. 001). Age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> was later in the Met homozygote group (non significant, F= 2. 348; p= 0. 099). The cannabis-COMT interaction showed a significant effect in both DUP and age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> (F= 3. 816; p= 0. 024). Post hoc analyses showed that differences between genotypes were only present in the non-cannabis users group. Conclusions: Cannabis users had an earlier age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and shorter DUPs. Val carriers had an earlier age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and longer DUPs, but only in the non-cannabis user group. Cannabis seems to modulate the age <b>of</b> <b>onset</b> and DUP in first episode psychosis independently of gender and to moderate the effect of COMT Val 158 Met polymorphism. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
