5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public had never heard of Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion at all about him. In contrast, 0% of the public had never heard <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E

Clinton {{was confirmed by}} a vote of 94-2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her senate seat, effective immediately. This began a two-month search process to fill her vacant Senate seat. Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 {{for the remainder of the}} full term, which ended in January 2013.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton,</b> the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} of March 2008, rumors that Obama was born in Kenya before being flown to Hawaii were spread on {{conservative}} websites, with the suggestion that this would disqualify Obama from the presidency. In April of that year, anonymous e-mails from supporters <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> repeated the same rumor, including a Clinton Iowa campaign worker, who was fired for sending the e-mail. These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama's origin, religion, and birth certificate.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Donald Trump as the 45th. President of the United States of America caught European polity completely off-guard {{with the majority}} of the political, financial & bureaucratic elite having openly come out in support <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> and making disparaging statements about Donald Trump during the US Presidential Campaign period. Brussels has listed the US as posing an existential threat to the EU. Immigration, trade and geopolitical policies unveiled by the Trump administration have provoked reactions ranging from anger to dismay amongst longstanding US allies. Donald Trump has stated that the United Nations and NATO are obsolete in their current form and has threatened to withhold US Government funding and review obligations unless both institutions are revamped to alleviate the financial burden on US-taxpayers and modernize themselves to represent the geopolitical realities of the 21st.century. Statements from Presidential advisors and senior administration officials indicate that President Trump is indifferent {{to the future of the}} European Union and the Euro currency.|$|E

500|$|Reed came to {{national}} attention for {{his support of}} the candidacy <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> for the U.S. Democratic Party nomination for president. [...] A column published under his name on CNN.com saying that Bernie Sanders was [...] "out of step" [...] with Democrats was written by Tharon Johnson, a lobbyist for [...] the UnitedHealth Group, Honda, MGM Resorts International and other corporate clients. [...] It was then edited by Correct the Record, a Clinton-supporting Super PAC, before publication.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bill Powers, {{chair of the}} New York Republican State Committee, said the report [...] "once again makes us question" [...] the believability of Clinton, and Congressman Rick Lazio, her Republican {{opponent}} in the Senate election, said [...] "We believe that character counts in public service." [...] New York Times columnist Safire updated his description <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> to [...] "habitual prevaricator", saying [...] "the evidence {{that she has been}} lying all along is damning" [...] and comparing her dark side to that of Richard Nixon, in whose White House he had once worked.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Independent Counsel Robert Ray filed {{his final}} reports {{regarding}} the long-running Whitewater, [...] "Travelgate", and [...] "Filegate" [...] {{investigations of the}} White House, each of which included specific investigations <b>of</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Clinton</b> actions. [...] The reports exonerated her on the files matter, said there was insufficient evidence regarding her role in Whitewater, {{and said that she}} had made factually false statements regarding the Travel Office firings but there was insufficient evidence to prosecute her. [...] Although The New York Times editorialized that the release of the reports seemed possibly timed to coincide with the Senate election, in practice the findings were not seen as likely to sway many voters' opinions.|$|E
