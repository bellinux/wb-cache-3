40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} and comparative study of four commentators on the later Wittgenstein’s rule following considerations. As such its primary aim is exegetical, and ultimately the thesis seeks to arrive at an enriched understanding of Wittgenstein’s work through the distillation of the four commentators into what, it is hoped, {{can be said to}} approach a definitive interpretation, freed of their individual frailties. The thesis commences by explicating the position of Kripke’s Wittgenstein. He draws our attention to the ‘sceptical problem’ of how we are to resolve the apparently paradoxical situation that whilst we seem to use language meaningfully, there is no fact about us that constitutes our meaning one thing as opposed to something else, and consequently the possibility of our actually meaning anything seems to evaporate. Kripke interprets Wittgenstein as accepting the validity of the sceptical problem, but seeking to establish that the force of the problem is radically diminished because the justification which it has shown to be unobtainable is actually unnecessary for rule following to take place. McDowell tries to show that Kripke is mistaken when he views Wittgenstein as endorsing scepticism in this way, because he sees Kripke as failing to appreciate a section of Philosophical Investigations which suggests that one ought to reject the sceptical paradox by correcting the misunderstanding which gives rise to it. McDowell reads Wittgenstein’s claim as being that we mistakenly think we are caught in a dilemma which requires us either to endorse the sceptical paradox <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> a mythological picture of rule following; whereas, so the thought goes, we must reject the entire dilemma. Although McDowell’s criticism of Kripke is essentially correct, he is motivated to that criticism by an incorrect reading of Wittgenstein. Central to this misinterpretation is his failure to note Wittgenstein’s belief that universal scepticism is nonsensical. Winch does much to flesh out the nature of Wittgenstein’s claim here, although he makes the mistake of attributing to Kripke that position which the latter finds in Philosophical Investigations. Despite inheriting this error from Winch, Diamond nonetheless improves on his attempt to characterize the shortcomings of Kripke’s reading as an interpretation of Wittgenstein, enabling the thesis to reach a conclusion about Wittgenstein’s understanding of rule following...|$|E

40|$|From Lukács to Bourdieu, many {{significant}} intellectual {{developments have}} taken place and, in fact, one may gain {{the impression that the}} critical tradition continues to be based on one key assumption: individuals (workers, social actors, etc.) unconsciously reproduce the social structures of capitalism whilst being alienated by them. They accept the conditions enforced on them and no longer seek to rebel against a system which impoverishes not only their work and culture, but also their [soul]problematic? and creativity. The situation may be even more diree: they ensure the reproduction of the system by seeking to engage in mass consumption at any cost, or by glorifying the dominant values. 	In this chapter I would like to show that toay, no critical perspective has emerged out of a negative representation of the world such is likely to introduce ‘man’ living here and now as something other than a deeply bastardized being, corrupted, denatured, perverted, inflected, soiled by a civilizing process which owes its perversion to modernity (Rousseau) on the one hand, and to capitalism on the other. As we shall see, without making an exception, Honneth has rightly noted that all the authors of the tradition of what he calls ‘social philosophy’ have remained dependent on a form of disgust regarding the world as it is. 	Yet for me as a sociologist of social movements, it seems difficult to deal with such a [software]? of the new forms of social resistance to domination (Indignados, anonymous, alternative economy, movements of the ‘-less’ – see Frère and Jacquemain, 2013), even though it is precisely the same kind of diagnosis adopted by a significant number of theories dealing with cooperation and association. Some amongst them leave me sceptical, notably {{when it comes to the}} shared desire to [locate,]posit? for instance, an alternative and [solidary]? economy in the field of utopia, as opposed to a succinct and time-honoured representation of Marxism (Pessin, 2001; Pradès, 2012; Hély and Moulévrier, 2013), <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> the 'natural' reciprocity of human beings as they lived before the arrival of capitalist modernity,, thus before the ideology of growth perverted human imagination (Godbout, 2000). is this right? 	In my opinion, in order to be able to talk about contemporary reactions of resistance against diverse forms of alienation and domination authorized by contemporary [connectionist]? capitalism, a philosophical representation of the passive, unconscious human reified by this very same domination, which only a few holy utopian thinkers would avoid, remains ineffective. This is because, in the case of such a representation, the modern subject will be likely to react when criticism will have taken away that layer of impurity specific to the condition of alienated man in order to allow him to renew his deep nature, the one which was his in the context of the ‘good life’, as Habermas and Honneth would say. Yet abolishing the very possibility of transcendentalism and idealism which lies implicit in contemporary critical theories, whether French or German, opens the door to the possibility, in the incertitude of the social model that they may create, of an actual – but profane – criticism of capitalisme. Here, it is a matter of human relationships in the world that gives criticism its content, in all their insurmountable impurity, in all their contingency. Aiming at abolishing the transcendental anthropological foundations that criticism has always allowed itself, this gesture is currently silhouetted not in philosophy but, rather, in a sociology, that is, ‘pragmatic sociology’. Parallel to the classical Marxist tradition traversing Bourdieu’s critical sociology and the intellectual tradition of the Frankfurt School, it is a form of ‘critical materialism’ that I would like to exhume in this chapter, a notion inspired by the libertarian Marxism of Lefort and Castoriadis (see Frère, 2009), which is able to make the profane capacities of people’s emancipation emerge. I would like to do so on the basis of a reflection revolving around the pragmatic perspective which has recently been reinforced in France by Boltanski in his book De la critique (2009), but which stands – in my view – as the backdrop of all his works...|$|E
40|$|Suing actual infringers is passe in {{copyright}} law. In {{the digital}} environment, the real stakes lie in suing those who facilitate infringement by others. There {{is of course}} a good reason copyright owners are filing such suits. They see themselves as under threat from a flood of cheap, easy copies and {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of people who can make those copies. The high volume of illegal uses, and the low return to suing any individual, make it more cost-effective to aim as far up the chain as possible. From the perspective of the movie industry, it's easier and more effective to shut down Napster than to sue the millions of people who traded files illegally on Napster. So far, the courts have been willing to go along, shutting down a number of innovative services in the digital music realm. In this article, we argue that unrestricted liability for anyone who is in any way involved with copyright infringement is a bad idea. Indirect liability is a continuum, in which acts most closely related to infringement and with the fewest affirmative benefits are the easiest to condemn. Going after makers of technology for the uses to which their technologies may be put threatens to stifle innovation. The fundamental difficulty is that while courts can make decisions about direct infringement on a case-by-case basis, lawsuits based on indirect liability necessarily sweep together both socially beneficial and socially harmful uses of a program or service, either permitting both uses or condemning both. Optimal digital copyright policy would do two things: stop deterring innovators, and permit cost-effective enforcement of copyright in the digital environment. In this paper, we suggest at least two possible alternatives that might provide ways out of the digital copyright morass. Both alternatives stem from the basic economics of copyright enforcement. It is not currently cost-effective for copyright owners to sue individual infringers, because there are tens of millions of them, because lawsuits are expensive, and because each infringer would be liable only for minimal damages. They are happy to sue facilitators instead, because there are fewer of them and both damages and the benefits of injunctive relief are substantial. Copyright owners have no incentive to permit optimal innovation by facilitators, because they do not benefit from that innovation except indirectly. Individual infringers in turn have no incentive to change their behavior <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> fee-based services, because they suffer none of the costs of infringement. One solution is to change the incentives of individuals. Because individual users of peer-to-peer (p 2 p) networks know that it is extremely unlikely they will be sued, economic theory suggests that the only way to effectively deter infringement is to increase the effective sanction substantially for those who are caught. Were the government to begin criminally prosecuting selected users of peer-to-peer services - or were the RIAA to sue end users in earnest - it could have a substantial deterrent effect on many illegal users. Selective prosecution has other advantages as well - the government could target the relatively few keystone providers of illegal files on p 2 p sites, and those are precisely the users who are least likely to be engaged in fair use. While particular prosecutions won't stop illegal file trading altogether, copyright owners have never been able to prevent all piracy. All they need to do is reduce piracy enough that they can make a return on their investment. Another solution is to change the incentives of copyright owners to sue individual infringers by reducing the cost of such a suit. One such approach would be a levy system. Levies on equipment or services have the virtue of permitting automatic collection of royalties, reducing the enforcement cost dramatically, but at the cost of taxing legal as well as illegal uses. A levy solves the enforcement problem at the front end, but it is similar in many ways to the current approach of suing facilitators. The main difference is that under a levy system the copyright owner is protected by a compulsory license rather than a property rule. An alternative proposal to reduce the cost of enforcement is to create some sort of quick, cheap arbitration system that enables copyright owners to get some limited relief against abusers of p 2 p systems. The existing domain name trademark arbitration system is a model in some respects - its speed and low cost - but a cautionary tale in others - its lack of process protections. Such a system would permit low-cost enforcement of copyright infringement against direct infringers, reducing the need for content owners to sue facilitators. Relative to levies, an arbitration system would trade off some increase in cost for accuracy, targeting only those making illegal uses rather than all users of computers or p 2 p networks. It would be fairer than selective criminal prosecution, because the burden would fall more evenly on each wrongdoer, rather than imposing stark punishment on a few in order to serve society's interest in deterring the rest. The system could also be designed to improve accuracy relative to the binary choice the courts face in indirect infringement cases today. We could design the system so that it is limited to clear cases. We could also build in a defense for arguable fair uses, so that a user who could prove they were space-shifting CDs they already own would have a defens...|$|E

Construction of buildings, or portions thereof, used predominantly for general conduct of government (e. g. city halls, courthouses, jails, police stations, etc.) 2. General government expenses. 3. Costs of operating and maintaining public facilities and services (e. g. mowing parks and replacing street light bulbs). 4. Servicing or refinancing existing debt. Under the CDAP Economic Development component funds {{may be used to}} assist for profit and not-for-profit firms to carry out economic development projects. Generally, CDAP grant funds will be provided by the unit of local government <b>to</b> the profit <b>or</b> not-for-profit business under a financial assistance agreement at agreed upon terms. "Financial assistance" means the provision of funds to an eligible economic development project through the purchase of any note, stock, convertible security, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, preorganization certificate of subscription, transferable share, investment contract, certificate of deposit for a security, certificate of interest or participation in a patent or application therefor, or in royalty or other payments under such a patent or application, or in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a "security" or any certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or option, warrant <b>or</b> right <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> purchase any of the foregoing, but not including any instrument which contains voting rights in the possession of the Grantee, or other means whereby financial aid is made <b>to</b> <b>or</b> on behalf of an Illinois company as appropriate to the form of agreement, for working capital, the purchase or lease of machinery and equipment, or the lease or purchase of real estate, but does not include refinancing debt. Loans, investments and lines of credit may be extended in participation with other financial institutions. By providing expanded application for CDAP funds, the unit of local government will have enhanced capacity to pool public and private resources in support of a community project. The business may use the funds for land acquisition, construction, reconstruction, installation or rehabilitation of commercial or industrial buildings, structures and other real property; equipment and improvements and working capital expenses. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program was established by the federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (Act). Administered nationally by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Act combined eight existing categorical programs into a single block grant program. In 1981, Congress amended the Act to allow states to directly administer the block grant for small cities.

40|$|In four puzzling {{areas of}} {{information}} in politics, simple intuition and simple theory seem to conflict, muddling policy choices. This thesis elaborates theory to help resolve these conflicts. The puzzle of product bans is why regulators don't instead offer the equivalent information, for example through a "would have banned" label. Regulators can want to lie with labels, however, either due <b>to</b> regulatory capture <b>or</b> <b>to</b> correct for market imperfections. Knowing this, consumers discount regulator warnings, and so regulators can prefer bans over the choices of skeptical consumers. But all sides can prefer regulators {{who are unable to}} ban products, since then regulator warnings will be taken more seriously. The puzzle of voter information is why voters are not even more poorly informed; press coverage of politics seems out of proportion to its entertainment value. Voters can, however, want to commit to becoming informed, either by learning about issues <b>or</b> by <b>subscribing</b> <b>to</b> sources, to convince candidates to take favorable positions. Voters can also prefer to be in large groups, and to be ignorant in certain ways. This complicates the evaluation of institutions, like voting pools, which reduce ignorance. The puzzle of group insurance as a cure for adverse selection is why this should be less a problem for groups than individuals. The usual argument about reduced variance of types for groups doesn't work in separating equilibria; what matters is the range, not variance, of types. Democratic group choice can, however, narrow the group type range by failing to represent part of the electorate. Furthermore, random juries can completely eliminate adverse selection losses. The puzzle of persistent political disagreement is that for ideal Bayesians with common priors, the mere fact of a factual disagreement is enough of a clue to induce agreement. But what about agents like humans with severe computational limitations? If such agents agree that they are savvy in being aware of these limitations, then any factual disagreement implies disagreement about their average biases. Yet average bias can in principle be computed without any private information. Thus disagreements seem to be fundamentally about priors or computation, rather than information. ...|$|R
