5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates <b>of</b> <b>grease</b> and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E

5|$|In March 1979, when Gaven {{was twenty}} years old, {{she served as}} the {{replacement}} actress for the character Betty Rizzo in the original Broadway production <b>of</b> <b>Grease.</b> This was her Broadway debut. In late 1980, she was cast in the lead role of Janet in the musical The Rocky Horror Show that ran for six nights at Warner Theatre. It {{tells the story of}} a couple, Brad and Janet, who find themselves lost one night and end up in the laboratory of an alien doctor. The cast, including Gaven, was praised by critics. In 1984, she played a Londoner in the revival of Oliver! at Broadway and was the understudy for the major role of Nancy. That same year, in the Broadway revival of Zorba, Gaven played the role of The Widow who is eventually stoned to death by the townspeople after being held responsible for the suicide of a young boy who fell in love with her. She then portrayed the character Luisa, the wife of an Italian film director, in a production of Nine at An Evening Dinner Theater in 1985.|$|E

On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off Misfits, a late-night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and The Second Coming, a series that depicted the Second Coming of Christ in contemporary Manchester. Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The Second Coming was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of The Second Coming, he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{the effect of}} base oil {{viscosity}} and fume silica concentration on properties <b>of</b> formulated <b>greases</b> has been investigated. Mixture <b>of</b> <b>greases</b> is formulated using poly-methylsiloxane (with viscosity 500, 1000 and 2000 cS at 25 °C) as base oil and thickened with 5 - 13 % wt. fume silica. The results of testing have been done on formulated grease (penetration test, oil separation test, drop point test, corrosive substance, stability of the consistency at high temperature test) show {{that the increase in}} the fume silica concentration at same base oil viscosity increases the consistency <b>of</b> formulated <b>grease,</b> while the oil separation rapidly decreases by increasing the fume silica concentration at same oil viscosity. After 10 % wt. addition of fume silica, oil separation becomes approximately unchanged. The result of the study of the effect of the base oil viscosity on the oil separation and consistency <b>of</b> formulated <b>grease</b> using 10 % addition of fume silica shows that oil separation decreases and consistency increase with viscosity. No drop point <b>of</b> formulated <b>greases</b> was discovered (340 °C +) and this means that the structure <b>of</b> formulated <b>grease</b> remains stable...|$|R

He received Jimmie's Fender Broadcaster, which he later traded for an Epiphone Riviera. When Jimmie left home at age sixteen, Vaughan's apparent obsession with the instrument caused a lack of support from his parents.

25|$|On May 29, 1814 Governor Macdonell sent John Spencer, the colony’s sheriff, {{to seize}} {{provisions}} {{located at the}} NWC's Rivière la Souris post. He confiscated 500 bags of pemmican, 96 kegs <b>of</b> <b>grease</b> and 9 bales of dried meat.(p.28) He also confiscated two chests of NWC-owned guns {{to prevent them from}} being sold to the Métis and thus preventing them from hunting buffalo. Part of the confiscated provisions were taken across the river to Brandon House, while the rest was taken to Fort Douglas under an armed escort. Next, Macdonell’s men confiscated 200 bags of pemmican from a HBC trader named Stett who was transporting 300 bags to York Factory. Shortly afterward, the NWC’s Duncan Cameron took an armed party of voyageurs to locate and arrest an HBC trader named House who had helped break into the Rivière la Souris post. Governor Macdonell next built a battery on the Assiniboine River to more effectively command the river and another on the Red River near Fort Douglas. The Red River blockade soon captured two NWC light canoes with 2 clerks, 20 men and 2 chests of arms. The voyageurs were paroled, but the clerks and the chests of arms were sent to Fort Douglas.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application <b>of</b> <b>grease</b> during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E

40|$|The {{friction}} torque and the operating temperatures in a {{thrust ball bearing}} were measured for seven different types <b>of</b> <b>greases,</b> including three biodegradable greases having low toxicity.

Bleed oils were extracted from the greases and the dynamic viscosities were measured. In order to compare the performance <b>of</b> the lubricant <b>greases</b> in terms <b>of</b> friction, the <b>grease</b> characteristics were related to experimental results, showing that the interaction between thickener and base oil have strong influences in the bearing friction torque...|$|R
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount <b>of</b> <b>grease</b> to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
