The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks. They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop a rock and a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a log of wood. The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E

50|$|In some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> an Elvis Presley sound alike version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1965 Roger Miller song King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road {{was used}} as {{background}} music. Another set <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series <b>of</b> <b>commercials</b> featured a generic Elvis Presley sound alike title as background song. In some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spots the Elvis impersonator was offered a ride in a silver colored Audi sedan.

5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this {{cross-sectional}} {{study was to}} enumerate and describe violent and risky behaviors {{as well as other}} general health behaviors exhibited in the advertisements during the National Football League (NFL) Super Bowl 2015. Methods: <b>Commercials</b> during <b>the</b> NFL Super Bowl 2015 were assessed for violent and risky behaviors. Additional health behaviors were indicated such as <b>the</b> advertisement <b>of</b> unhealthy food, promotion of physical activity, and sexual content. Results: A total of 110 commercials were documented, accounting for 64 minutes of broadcast time. Commercials promoting automobiles, television shows, food, and movies were the most prevalent, representing just over half (53. 7 %) <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advertisements featured. Depictions of unsafe driving were found in 10. 9 % (n = 12) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials.</b> All 12 commercials contained some sort of risky or wild driving behavior, and speeding was observed in 11 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 <b>commercials.</b> A total of 32 (29. 1 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> were coded as including violent content. Physical activity behavior was present in 3 (2. 7 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials.</b> Conversely, substance use was observed in 3 (2. 7 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials,</b> none <b>of</b> which included health promotion messaging. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 110 <b>commercials</b> aired during <b>the</b> 2015 Super Bowl, 12. 7 % (n = 14) included sexual content. Conclusion: Parents should consider the possibility that their children may observe acts of violence or conflicting safety messages during commercial breaks...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{based on the idea that}} TV genres are built and {{interpreted}} according to three worlds which are interpretants in a peircian sense: the real world, the fictitious world and the ludic world. In accordance with a pragmatic approach, we claim that <b>the</b> statute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> varies according to strategies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emitter and <b>the</b> believing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewer in advertisement: it may be linked to the three worlds. It is what it is shown from <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first and <b>the</b> second season <b>of</b> Loft Story, of Nice People and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> that are inserted in these programmes. The relationship between the programmes and <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> helps to define what reality and game mean for television. If <b>the</b> programme authenticates <b>commercials</b> in certain occurrences, inversely, commercials give meaning to the programmes, suggesting to viewers reading grids or some interpretations of programmes.

5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which marked the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples.
