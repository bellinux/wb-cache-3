50|$|Ethanimine is an <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> {{classified}} as an imine. It {{is not well}} known terrestrially, but has been detected in abundance towards Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), a dense interstellar cloud in between stars towards the galactic center of the Milky Way. The distance between the Sgr B2 cloud and center of galaxy is 100 pc (1 pc=3.26l y). Ethanimine is mainly found in hot cores of ISM clouds; in case of Sgr B2, the region would be the Sgr B2 N and Sgr B2 M. The radio telescopes such as the Green Bank Telescope and NRAO (measures radio frequency light lambda ranging from 1-300 GHz) are able to detect organic molecules such as ethanimines because its internal energy transition, more specifically the rotational transition is within the radio frequency of 14085 MHz=140.8 GHz.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{studies on}} the {{catabolism}} of <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> have accelerated due to the recognition that these compounds are widespread and significant environmentally. Nitrogen {{is the second most}} abundant macronutrient in cellu-lar organisms, where it is found in major macromolecules (pro-teins and nucleic acids), primary metabolites (ATP and NADH), and secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics. Well over 50, 000 <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> are biosynthesized by plants and microbes (27). Many of these compounds are N-heterocycles, ring structures containing one or more nitrogen atoms in the rings. A significant fraction of anthropogenic compounds, commodity chemicals and pharmaceuticals, are N-heterocycles. One class of industrial N-heterocycles, also known as s-triazines, contain the 1, 3, 5 -triazine ring. Humans introduced s-triazine herbicides, such as atrazine (Fig. 1), into the environment one-half century ago. Commer-cial s-triazines characteristically contain ring carbon atoms that contain substituents other than hydrogen (Fig. 1, upper left). This fundamental ring structure resembles the 1, 3 -diazenes, or pyrimidines, and as such, their metabolic transformation by microbes should be reasonably facile. However, s-triazine com-pounds were initially found to be poorly biodegradable.

Asphaltene was separated by Soxhlet extraction with methylbenzene and then divided into three parts by distillation. Gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) to separate and characterize organic nitrogen species in the distillates of asphaltene at molecular level. Molecular mass of compounds was mainly distributed from 150 to 600  μ. Number of rings plus double bonds (rdb) and synchronous fluorescence spectra indicated that most of the <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> (NPAC) contained heterocyclic aromatic rings, including pyridines, anilines, quinolins, pyrroles, carbazoles and indoles plus various alkyl groups. Constant-wavelength synchronous fluorescence spectrometry (CWSFS) indicated NPAC with 2 – 3 rings were the main structures of <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and the corresponding structural information was proposed. Some organic nitrogen isomers were separated and identified by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) GC-Q-TOF MS and electrospray ionization (ESI) HPLC-Q-TOF MS.

Identifying molecular structures provides a foundation to understand all aspects of coal-derived asphaltene, enabling a first-principles approach to optimize resource utilization.|$|R
40|$|As a {{class of}} brown carbon, <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> {{originating}} from the heterogeneous uptake of NH 3 by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) have received significant attention recently. In the current work, particulate organonitrogen formation during the ozonolysis of alpha-pinene and the OH oxidation of m-xylene {{in the presence of}} ammonia (34 - 125 ppb) was studied in a smog chamber equipped with a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer and a quantum cascade laser instrument. A large diversity of nitrogen-containing organic (NOC) fragments was observed which were consistent with the reactions between ammonia and carbonyl-containing SOA. Ammonia uptake coefficients onto SOA which led to <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> were reported for the first time, and were in the range of similar to 10 (- 3) - 10 (- 2), decreasing significantly to < 10 (- 5) after 6 h of reaction. At the end of experiments (similar to 6 h) the NOC mass contributed 8. 9 +/- 1. 7 and 31. 5 +/- 4. 4 wt% to the total alpha-pineneand m-xylene-derived SOA, respectively, and 4 - 15 wt% of the total nitrogen in the system. Uptake coefficients were also found to be positively correlated with particle acidity and negatively correlated with NH 3 concentration, indicating that heterogeneous reactions were responsible for the observed NOC mass, possibly limited by liquid phase diffusion. Under these conditions, the data also indicate that the formation of NOC can compete kinetically with inorganic acid neutralization. The formation of NOC in this study suggests that {{a significant portion of the}} ambient particle associated N may be derived from NH 3 heterogeneous reactions with SOA. NOC from such a mechanism may be an important and unaccounted for source of PM associated nitrogen. This mechanism may also contribute to the medium or long-range transport and wet/dry deposition of atmospheric nitrogen...|$|R

Complexation of 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) and other selected organonitrogens with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The magnitude of 1 H NMR chemical shift change upon SWCNT:organonitrogen complex formation represents {{the strength of the}} association. Magnitudes of changes in NMR signals of different protons in the organonitrogen reveal which protons are in close proximity to SWCNTs.

Spectral data of the optical properties, however, are scarce. The present study obtained the continuous spectra of the real and imaginary refractive indices (m = n-i k) in the ultraviolet (UV) -to-visible region using spectroscopic ellipsometry for n and UV–visible spectrometry for k. Several different types of SOM were produced in an oxidation flow reactor by photooxidation of toluene and m -xylene for variable concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO x). The {{results show that the}} k values of the anthropogenically derived material were at least 10 times greater than those of the biogenically derived material.

In an attempt to extend the addition of hydride reagents E-H (where E = BR 2, AlR 2, and SiR 3) to the dinitrogen complex ([NPN]Ta) 2 (μ-H) 2 (μ-η 1 :η 2 -N 2) [1; where NPN = (PhNSiMe 2 CH 2) 2 PPh], the reaction with zirconocene chlorohydride, [Cp 2 Zr(Cl) H]x, was examined. The crystalline product formed in 35 % yield was determined to be ([NP(N) N]Ta) (μ-H) 2 (μ-N) (Ta[NPN]) (ZrCp 2) (2) in which the coordinated N 2 has been cleaved to form a phosphinimide bridging between Ta and Zr and a triply bridging nitride. The mechanism of this reaction was examined to determine the fate of the chloride and hydride ligands attached to Zr in the starting zirconocene reagent. Using the zirconocene dihydride dimer ([Cp 2 ZrH 2] 2), a higher yield of 2 was obtained (76 %), and H 2 was also observed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. To probe the origin of the eliminated H 2, the dideuterated dinitrogen complex ([NPN]Ta) 2 (μ-D) 2 (μ-η 1 :η 2 -N 2) (d 2 - 1) was allowed to react with ([Cp 2 ZrH 2] 2), which resulted in the formation of ([NP(N) N]Ta) (μ-D) 2 (μ-N) (Ta[NPN]) (ZrCp 2), (d 2 - 2), with no evidence of hydrogen for deuterium scrambling between the starting zirconocene dihydride and the ditantalum dinitrogen complex.

40|$|Pollution is {{of concern}} for {{human health and the}} environment. Authorities have set {{concentration}} frames for many pollutants. Therefore, monitoring is required in industrial and farming activities, for example. Methods based on gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry are mainly utilized in the study of trace pollutants in the environmental samples. The main reason for that being versatility and robustness of the technique, which is capable of analysis of numerous compound groups covering all the main pollutants. This thesis focuses on recent gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry method development in environmental analysis. Samples of air particulate matter and from aqueous environment are covered. Optimization of tandem mass spectrometry parameters, such as excitation energies, the choice of precursor ions and product ions are shown. Tandem mass spectrometry techniques increase sensitivity and selectivity of the analysis by reducing baseline due to specific fragmentation. For the reason of comparison, conventional one dimensional mass spectrometric applications are shown and advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are discussed. Research papers published during past decade were reviewed. Studied material included research results of gas chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry applications for determination of organic compounds, such as endocrine disruptive compounds, organometals, illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, brominated and chlorinated organic compounds, some volatile organic <b>compounds,</b> <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in environmental samples. Sample collection and preparation techniques utilized in applications are reviewed as well. In the experimental part of this study, gas chromatography - mass spectrometry method for the determination of carboxylic acids, phenols and sugars in aerosol particles was developed. The experimental part covers also the study of fatty acids, which are analyzed utilizing the same method. Fatty acids are qualitative trace markers for agriculture based pollution in air. Result of the practical application of fatty acids as trace marker is presented as well. Developed method for determining fatty acids was utilized in field campaign in Bologna, Italy. C 18 /C 16 –ratio is trace marker of agricultural based emission. Campaign results of C 18 /C 16 –ratio and is presented in this thesis. Day-of-week trend of fatty acid emission is covered as well. The utilization of tandem mass spectrometry will reduce common matrix effects of gas chromatography - mass spectrometry and in this way will make analysis more sensitive. Tandem mass spectrometry methods will complete to the requirements of environment monitoring and thus are highly recommended in environmental analysis. Vain tiivistelmä.

Aspects of the coordination chemistry of acrylonitrile CH(_ 2) : CHC : N and its methyl derivatives, CH(_ 2) : CMe C : N and MeCH : CH C : N have also been studied {{as well as their}} reactions with ether/SnCℓ(_ 2) /HCℓ systems. The main feature studied in the imine work was the tendency of compounds (4 -XC(_ 6) H(_ 4)) (_ 2) C = NSbCℓ(_n) (X = H or Me, n = 2 or 4) to undergo cyclometallation reaction forming a new type of antimony ring compound; 2 - SbCℓ(_n) – 4 – XC(_ 6) H(_ 3) C(4 – XC(_ 6) H(_ 4)) – NH. Related cyclometallation reactions are surveyed in chapter 1. During attempts to prepare other diarylketimino antimony tetrachlorides such as o-tolyl, ph C = NSbCℓ(_ 4); m-tolyl, ph C = NSbCℓ(_ 4) and (4 – FC(_ 6) H(_ 4)) (_ 2) C = NSbCℓ(_ 4), no analogous cyclometallated products were obtained. Instead two different products were isolated: Aryℓ(_ 2) CNH(^+) (_ 2) SbCℓ(^-) (_ 4) and Aryℓ(_ 2) CNH(^+) (_ 2) SbCℓ(^-) (_ 6). Attempts to prepare t-butyl derivatives of general formula Ar, Bu(^t) C = NSbCℓ(_ 4) (Ar = o-tolyl, p-tolyl; m-tolyl) afforded arylnitrile, HCℓ and SbCℓ(_ 3), probably by elimination of Me(_ 2) C = CH(_ 2). Chloroform solutions of diphenylketimine and antimony penta- or tri- chloride deposited ph(_ 2) CNH(^+) (_ 2) SbCℓ(^-) (_ 6) or (ph(_ 2) CNH(^+) (_ 2)) (_ 2) SbCℓ(_ 5) (^ 2 -) respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the project is to develop biochemical pathways for the selective cleavage of C-N bonds in molecules found in petroleum. The initial phase {{of the project was}} focused on the isolation or development of an enzyme capable of cleaving the C-N bond in aromatic amides, specifically 2 -aminobiphenyl. The {{objective of}} {{the second phase of the}} research will be to construct a biochemical pathway for the selective removal of nitrogen from carbazole by combining the carA genes from Sphingomonas sp. GTIN 11 with the gene(s) encoding an appropriate deaminase. The {{objective of the}} final phase of the project will be to develop derivative C-N bond cleaving enzymes that have broader substrate ranges and to demonstrate the use of such strains to selectively remove nitrogen from petroleum. During the first year of the project (October, 2002 -September, 2003) enrichment culture experiments resulted in the isolation of microbial cultures that utilize aromatic amides as sole nitrogen sources, several amidase genes were cloned and were included in directed evolution experiments to obtain derivatives that can cleave C-N bonds in aromatic amides, and the carA genes from Sphingomonas sp. GTIN 11, and Pseudomonas resinovorans CA 10 were cloned in vectors capable of replicating in Escherichia coli. During the second year of the project (October, 2003 -September, 2004) enrichment culture experiments succeeded in isolating a mixed bacterial culture that can utilize 2 -aminobiphenyl as a sole nitrogen source, directed evolution experiments were focused on the aniline dioxygenase enzyme that is capable of deaminating aniline, and expression vectors were constructed to enable the expression of genes encoding C-N bond cleaving enzymes in Rhodococcus hosts. The construction of a new metabolic pathway to selectively remove nitrogen from carbazole and other molecules typically found in petroleum should lead to the development of a process to improve oil refinery efficiency by reducing the poisoning, by nitrogen, of catalysts used in the hydrotreating and catalytic cracking of petroleum. Aromatic compounds such as carbazole are representative of the difficult-to-treat <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> most commonly encountered in petroleum. There are two C-N bonds in carbazole and the construction of a metabolic pathway for the removal of nitrogen from carbazole will require enzymes capable cleaving both C-N bonds. A multi-component enzyme, carbazole dioxygenase, which can selectively cleave the first C-N bond has been identified and the genes that encode this enzyme have been cloned, sequenced, and are being expressed in Rhodococcus erythropolis, a bacterial culture that tolerates exposure to petroleum. An enzyme capable of selectively cleaving the second C-N bond in carbazole has not yet been identified, but enrichment culture experiments have recently succeeded in isolating a bacterial culture that is a likely candidate and may possess a suitable enzyme. Research in the near future will verify if a suitable enzyme for the cleavage of the second C-N bond in carbazole has indeed been found, then the genes encoding a suitable enzyme will be identified, cloned, and sequenced. Ultimately genes encoding enzymes for selective cleavage of both C-N bonds in carbazole will be assembled into a new metabolic pathway and the ability of the resulting bacterial culture to remove nitrogen from petroleum will be determined...|$|R

PMF analysis successfull extracted 11 factors from mass spectra of about 700 000 particles as a complement to information on particle types (from K-mean cluster analysis).

40|$|A set of zeolite {{synthesis}} experiments {{is described}} where lattice substitution is varied {{in the context}} of the structure of particular structure-directing organocations (at times referred to as templates). In this particular series, the organocations are constructed as members of a fused bicyclo <b>organonitrogen</b> class of <b>compounds,</b> described as having ring construction [l. m. n], where n = 0.

Often their use in zeolite synthesis led to different products. There is a high correlation for the space-filling details of the guest organocations and the type of crystalline host lattice developed in the synthesis. In one instance involving isomers of a decahydroquinoline derivative, a new zeolite, SSZ- 48, is discovered and contains only one of the isomers. Characterization of the isomers and their use in the zeolites is followed by 13 C MAS NMR analyses.

40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} can be divided in to parts, one {{is based on the}} Pd/Ag alloy {{membranes}} and the other is about the model systems. It is well known that, Pd is a potential candidate membrane material, due to both its high solubility and permeability to hydrogen. Alloying of Pd with 23 wt% Ag {{has been found to be}} an optimum composition for high hydrogen permeability. Thin Pd/Ag 23 wt% free standing films of thicknesses in the range 1. 3 - 10 μm were prepared by magnetron sputtering. The influence of thermal treatments in different gases on the hydrogen permeation behaviour of the selected membranes and the surface properties were investigated through a combination of hydrogen flow measurements and surface characterization. After thermal treatment in air at 300 °C, we observed enhanced hydrogen permeation for ~ 1. 3 to 5 μm membranes. Topography studies by atomic force microscopy showed that the increase in permeance correlated with increase in surface roughness and surface area. A similar behaviour in improvement of hydrogen flux was observed for an alternative treatment namely heat treatment in N 2 /Ar at 400 °C for 1. 5 μm membranes. The topography investigations showed increase in surface roughness and area also after this treatment. To shed more light on the effect of the N 2 /Ar thermal treatments, we performed thermal treatments in this presumed inert atmosphere at three different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C and 450 °C) for three different film thicknesses, 2 μm, 5 μm and 10 μm. For comparison we performed thermal treatment in air at 300 °C for all selected films. After all treatments the hydrogen flux was found to be increase compared to before treatment for the 2 μm membranes, more strongly for the higher temperatures. In contrast for the thicker films the flux was decreasing after the treatments except for the 5 μm membranes thermally treated in N 2 /Ar at 450 °C. On the other hand improvement in flux was obtained for all samples after air treatment at 300 °C. Increase in surface roughness and surface area were accompanying the increased flux for the 2 μm membranes. No significant changes in surface roughness, at the initially rougher membrane surface, were observed for the membranes with decreasing flux. Summarizing all results from our group indicates bulk limited hydrogen permeation for the membranes of thickness down to 1. 5 - 2 μm thermally treated in air at 300 °C. Chemical composition analysis revealed Ag segregation to the surface for all N 2 /Ar thermal treated membranes and reverse segregation behaviour for air-treated on 1. 5 μm and 5 μm membranes. Long term stability of a 2. 6 μm Pd- 23 %Ag/stainless steel composite membrane was examined in H 2 /N 2 mixture as a function of both temperature and feed pressure. During continuous operation, the membrane showed good stability at 400 °C while the N 2 leakage increased very slowly at a temperature of 450 °C (P feed = 10 bar). After 100 days of operation (P feed = 5 - 20 bar, T= 350 - 450 °C), the N 2 permeance was 7. 0 x 10 - 9 mol m- 2 s- 1 Pa - 1, which indicates that the H 2 /N 2 permselectivity still lies around 500. Surface topography observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed small changes in surface area after the long term stability measurements. Possible surface defects were also detected. In addition, segregation of Ag to the membrane surfaces was found from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). To address specific issues related to Pd based membrane systems, two selected Pd based model systems were studies as part of this thesis work. Molecular adsorption of methanol and its decomposition pathway on clean Pd(110) and an alloy Ag/Pd(110) surface were investigated. Multilayer methanol molecules adsorption on the surface was found at 100 K. The methanol behaviour of these two surfaces was quite similar. Upon heating to 170 K, two methanol species were identified. CO was formed on the surfaces at 250 K and was desorbed at 500 K. These studies show that silver at the amount deposited in the present work does not influence the methanol decomposition as compared to clean Pd(110). As a model system for addressing interactions of adsorbed <b>organonitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> on Pd(110) we have studied the methylamine molecular adsorption behaviour on this surface. Decomposition of adsorbed CH 3 NH 2 to CN occurs mainly in the temperature range from 300 K to 350 K. The intermediate species CN remained at the surface even after annealing to 800 K. Density function theory shows that methylamine is found to bind to Pd(110) surface via a lone pair state on the N atom. PhD i fysikkPhD in Physic...|$|R
