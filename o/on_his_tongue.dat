5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
500|$|Following {{confirmation}} {{from the}} group that 2010's The Final Frontier would not be their last album, Bruce Dickinson revealed plans for a sixteenth studio record in July 2013, with a potential release date in 2015. In February 2015, drummer Nicko McBrain revealed that a new album had been completed, although the release {{has been put on}} hold while Dickinson recovers from treatment for a cancerous tumour found <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue.</b> On 15 May, after Dickinson had been given the all-clear, manager Rod Smallwood confirmed that the album would be released in 2015, although the band will not tour until 2016 to allow Dickinson to recuperate. [...] On 18 June 2015, the band's website announced its title, The Book of Souls, and confirmed a release date of 4 September 2015. A critical and commercial success, it received positive reviews and became the band's fifth UK No. 1 album.|$|E
500|$|Korn {{begins with}} [...] "Blind", {{starting}} with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis' first line is [...] "Are you ready?!", which {{is now one of}} the band's trademarks. [...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how he would feel scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out. It's a really heavy sound." [...] "Ball Tongue" [...] is about a man had to work with Korn on a T-shirt design. He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> and he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses'). Then there's 'Little Red Riding Hood'—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her." ...|$|E

500|$|For the {{convenience}} of other witnesses the commission moved to Hereford, where it resumed on 18 August 1307. The other six testifying to Cragh's execution included the hanged man himself, despite William de Briouze's stated belief that he had {{died of natural causes}} about two years earlier. The official language of the proceedings was ecclesiastical Latin, but Cragh spoke only Welsh, therefore two Franciscan friars from Hereford– John Young and Maurice of Pencoyd– were recruited as translators. Cragh is identified in the commission's records by his Welsh name, William ap Rhys, [...] "of the parish of Swansea in the diocese of Saint Davids". Of the eight other witnesses called, five testified in French and three in English. In his evidence Cragh stated that he believed himself to have been about 28 {{at the time of his}} hanging, and that his last conscious memory as he was dangling at the end of the rope was of the noise made by the crowd when Trahaern was hanged beside him. He denied his earlier story of having seen a vision of a white-clad bishop while he was hanging from the gallows, and instead claimed that the Virgin Mary had appeared to him on the morning of his execution, accompanied by [...] "a lordly figure" [...] she introduced as [...] "St Thomas", who she said would save him from the gallows. Under questioning Cragh said that he presumed the figure to be Cantilupe because he had been on pilgrimage to Cantilupe's shrine in Hereford, and because on the day of his imprisonment he had [...] "bent a penny ... to the honour of Saint Thomas so that he should liberate him". After hearing his testimony the commissioners physically examined Cragh, to confirm that he was indeed the man who had been hanged 18 years earlier. Although they found no marks around his neck they did discover some scarring <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue,</b> according to Cragh caused by him having bitten it while hanging.|$|E
2500|$|By {{careful and}} {{persistent}} experimentation, Esseintes learned to [...] "execute <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> {{a succession of}} voiceless melodies; noiseless funeral marches, solemn and stately; could hear in his mouth solos of crème de menthe, duets of vespertro and rum." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Gosch {{met with}} Bonacci and {{believed}} {{he was telling the}} truth. Noreen later met him and said he told her things [...] "he could know only from talking with her son." [...] He said that Johnny had a birthmark on his chest, a scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> and a burn scar on his lower leg; although a description of the birthmark had been widely circulated, information about the scars had not been made public. Bonacci also described a stammer that Johnny had when he was upset. The FBI and local police do not believe that Bonacci is a credible witness in the case and have not interviewed him.|$|E

He looked at me {{straight}}, and I looked straight at him; we remained that way for almost a minute. Then he decided not, on the whole, to risk it and took himself off.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Raven {{continued}} {{using such}} trickery to bring water and stamp people, animals {{and other features}} {{in the world with}} certain [...] characteristics. [...] Many versions of Raven's theft of water are told but all center on Raven's trickery against the owner of water. [...] In one version Raven leads its owner to believe he has soiled his bed in his sleep and threatens to shame him unless he shares his water with Raven. [...] In another version Raven puts ash <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> to fool the owner to believe his extreme thirst is unquenched. [...] Instead of drinking the water Raven collects it in a seal's bladder hidden under his clothes and flees with all of it.|$|E
2500|$|... "At NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (now renamed Johnson Space Center) {{we had a}} test subject accidentally {{exposed to}} a near vacuum (less than 1 psi) [...] in an {{incident}} involving a leaking space suit in a vacuum chamber back in '65. He remained conscious for about 14 seconds, {{which is about the}} time it takes for O2 deprived blood to go from the lungs to the brain. The suit probably did not reach a hard vacuum, and we began repressurizing the chamber within 15 seconds. The subject regained consciousness at around 15,000 feet [...] equivalent altitude. The subject later reported that he could feel and hear the air leaking out, and his last conscious memory was of the water <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>tongue</b> beginning to boil." ...|$|E
