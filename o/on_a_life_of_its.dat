5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E

While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.|$|E

25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket.

25|$|The {{argument}} {{was made in}} the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do with}} the composition. The evidence for this is in my view very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the {{argument was}} put forward, it took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.|$|E
25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville. In his {{capacity}} as papal legate, he {{handed over the}} inquiry to the Inquisitor of France, Jean Bréhal. On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8. This inquiry included most of the former tribunal members who were still living. Though Charles was keen to know the facts behind the case, he was not enamored of {{the thought of the}} Inquisition running a high-profile case in France outside of royal control. But through d'Estouteville's intervention, by December 1452 the case had taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, independent of Charles.|$|E

25|$|The term post-anarchism was {{originated}} by Saul Newman, {{and first}} received popular attention {{in his book}} From Bakunin to Lacan {{to refer to a}} theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own and a wide range of ideas including post-modernism, autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own. An automatic transmission is optional with the normally aspirated engine, but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the sources}} telling of the woes of tulip mania, such as the anti-speculative {{pamphlets}} that were later reported by Beckmann and Mackay, have been cited {{as evidence of the}} extent of the economic damage. These pamphlets, however, were not written by victims of a bubble, but were primarily religiously motivated. The upheaval was viewed as a perversion of the moral order—proof that [...] "concentration on the earthly, rather than the heavenly flower could have dire consequences".

In Explaining Hitler (1998), Rosenbaum called The Portage [...] "A Frankenstein story", referring to Steiner's fictive Hitler having taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own.

500|$|As German Romanticism got {{underway}} {{and writers}} started to seek authentic folklore, Jacob Grimm rejected Elf {{as a recent}} Anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form Elb (plural Elbe or Elben).

This in turn inspired Goethe's poem Der Erlkönig. Goethe's poem then took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking, which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.|$|E
