5000|$|... ==SPM and inflammation== The {{production}} {{and activities of}} the SPM suggest a new view of inflammation wherein the initial response to foreign organisms, tissue injury, or other insults involves numerous soluble cell signaling molecules that not only recruit various cell types to promote inflammation but concurrently cause these cells to produce SPM which feed back on their parent and other cells to dampen their pro-inflammatory activity and to promote repair. Resolution of an inflammatory response is thus an active rather than self-limiting process which is set into motion {{at least in part}} by the initiating pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin D2) which instruct relevant cells to produce SPM and to assume a more anti-inflammatory phenotype. Resolution of the normal inflammatory response, then, may involve switching production of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory PUFA metabolites. Excessive inflammatory responses to insult as well as many pathological inflammatory responses that contribute to diverse diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Inflammatory bowel disease, etc. (see Inflammation#Inflammatory disorders) may reflect, in part, a failure in this class switching. Diseases caused or worsened by non-adaptive inflammatory responses may by amenable to treatment with SPM or synthetic SPM which, unlike natural SPM, resist in vivo metabolic inactivation.

40|$|AbstractAn {{effective}} and well known technique for earlier completion of construction projects is to <b>overlap</b> the project <b>activities</b> or phases that normally would {{be performed in}} sequence. Overlapping, also called fast-tracking, is inherently risky because it increases uncertainties and can result in more changes and rework. In order to gain maximum advantages from early project completion, a tradeoff between benefits and losses of <b>activity</b> <b>overlapping</b> is required. Such a tradeoff {{is a type of}} time-cost tradeoff. Various time-cost tradeoffs have been extensively studied in the project management and construction management literature; however, limited research exists to address the <b>activity</b> <b>overlapping</b> time-cost tradeoff. In this research, the theoretical mechanism of overlapping has been identified through a literature review and interviews with planning and scheduling experts. Then, an objective function that reflects the overlapping time-cost tradeoff is developed. The paper explains the overlapping mechanism in detail, and introduces the suggested objective function. It also shows that the most important negative impact of <b>overlapping</b> design <b>activities</b> is the rework occurring due to incomplete information exchange between activities; such rework has both time and cost impacts on overlapping and should be considered a key parameter in the time-cost tradeoff. The results of this research can generate insights for further research to solve the overlapping time-cost tradeoff and determine the optimum <b>overlapping</b> degree between <b>activities</b> in construction projects...|$|R
40|$|Human self-consciousness {{relies on}} the ability to {{distinguish}} between oneself and others. We sought to explore the neural correlates involved in self-other representations by investigating two critical processes: perspective taking and agency. Although recent research has shed light on the neural processes underlying these phenomena, little is known about how they overlap or interact at the neural level. In a two-factorial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants played a ball-tossing game with two virtual characters ("avatars"). During an active/agency (ACT) task, subjects threw a ball to one of the avatars by pressing a button. During a passive/nonagency (PAS) task, they indicated which of the other avatars threw the ball. Both tasks were performed from a first-person perspective (1 PP), in which subjects interacted from their own perspective, and a third-person perspective (3 PP), in which subjects interacted from the perspective of an avatar with another location in space. fMRI analyses revealed <b>overlapping</b> <b>activity</b> in medial prefrontal regions associated with representations of one's own perspective and actions (1 PP and ACT), and <b>overlapping</b> <b>activity</b> in temporal-occipital, premotor, and inferior frontal, as well as posterior parietal regions associated with representation of others' perspectives and actions (3 PP and PAS). These findings provide evidence for distinct neural substrates underlying representations of the self and others and provide support for the idea that the medial prefrontal cortex crucially contributes to a neural basis of the self. The lack of a statistically significant interaction suggests that perspective taking and agency represent independent constituents of self-consciousness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTheoretically proper {{modeling}} of <b>overlapping</b> <b>activities</b> with traditional precedence relationships is impossible. This {{is due to}} the fact that traditional precedence relations create logic between the endpoints of activities. In contradiction, overlapping can be defined as a ‘continuous’ relation using time or location/production units between all the points of the predecessor and all the points of the successor activities. (E. g. at least 50 m safety distance is necessary between activity B and A during execution.) Recently developed point-to-point relations give a practically better solution, as they let planners form connections among as many internal points of the related activities as seemingly necessary, and all these points can be controlled during the execution phase. However, a theoretically proper solution is only available if an infinite number of point-to-point relations are used between two <b>overlapping</b> <b>activities,</b> but this is obviously impossible. The novelty of this paper is the definition of a new type of precedence relation for the Precedence Diagram Method (PDM), the so-called continuous relation. One continuous relation can be used instead of infinite point-to-point relations in order to perfectly model activity overlapping. Relation lags can be defined using either time or volume units. Another main advantage of this development is that continuous relations enable the definition of non-linear activities, while original PDM assumes continuous linear activities only...|$|E
