25|$|The Nord-Sud company {{lines were}} powered through <b>overhead</b> <b>cables,</b> whereas the third rail system was in {{use on the}} CMP's network.

To operate the ferry either the bridle cable is adjusted or a rudder is used, causing the ferry to be angled into the current, and the force of the current moves the ferry across the river.|$|R
