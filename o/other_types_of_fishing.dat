Non-flyfishing methods rely on a lure's weight to pull line from the reel during the forward motion of a cast.

According to Iaconelli, this moment sparked his interest in bass fishing. His love for bass fishing continued on into high school.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the willingness of}} saltwater anglers in Florida and Texas to substitute <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> {{for the type of}} fishing they most preferred. Anglers were asked if there was a suitable substitute for their most preferred species and, if so, what species would provide them with the same satisfaction and enjoyment as their most preferred species at the same cost. Most anglers (86 %) reported that other species would provide acceptable substitutes for their preferred species and were able to identify acceptable substitutes from a list of common saltwater species in Texas and Florida. Logistic regression was used {{to determine the effects of}} demographic and fishing participation variables on willingness to substitute. Willingness to substitute was positively related to years of education and negatively related to age and the importance placed on trophy-seeking experiences. Also, females were more willing to substitute than males. Results suggest that for some species substitution behavior in response to biologically or managerially imposed constraints on fishing activity could result in increased effort for other species in the saltwater fisheries of Texas and Florida...|$|E

40|$|As marine {{fisheries}} in Senegal are in serious decline due to overexploitation, {{the management of}} sustainable fisheries requires effective tactics based on scientific data. In order to characterize {{the current state of}} the artisanal fishery of the Kayar Marine Protected Area (MPA), a daily survey of fish landings was carried out between October 2013 and May 2015, and a database was created. Results showed that the landings are largely dominated by pelagic species in terms of weight. In total, 84 taxa were registered, including the species Sardinella aurita, which has been the most landed (30. 5 %), followed by Trichiurus lepturus (18. 9 %). These species are mainly captured by means of purse seine. The <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gear used in the area are the long line and the single line, which target particular species (e. g., Epinephelus aeneus). The temporal evolution of landings shows a period of abundance between May and June, while fishing effort is generally increasing. Regarding the spatial distribution, landings originate primarily from the MPA, where the landing per unit of effort was higher in the Angleterre area compared to other studied areas. These temporal and spatial variations seem to be related to the upwelling intensity which is highly seasonal, habitat features (i. e., presence of an underwater canyon in the MPA), the ecological behaviour of fish species and overexploitation. Our results confirm the need for detailed and extensive population monitoring across fish species. As a result of this study, we hope to provide the first essential information for the integrated management of {{fisheries in}} the Kayar MPA and its surrounding area...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{ecological}} {{importance of}} the red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the functioning of freshwater aquatic ecosystems is becoming more evident. It {{is important to know}} the limitations of sampling methods targeting this species, because accurate determination of population characteristics is required for predicting the ecological success of P. clarkii and its potential impacts on invaded ecosystems. In the current study, we addressed the question of trap efficiency by comparing population structure provided by eight trap devices (varying in number and position of entrances, mesh size, trap size and construction materials) in three habitats (a pond, a reed bed and a grassland) in a French marsh in spring 2010. Based on a large collection of P. clarkii (n = 2091, 272 and 213 respectively in the pond, reed bed and grassland habitats), we found that semicylindrical traps made from 5. 5 mm mesh galvanized steel wire (SCG) were the most efficient in terms of catch probability (96. 7 - 100 % compared to 15. 7 - 82. 8 % depending on trap types and habitats) and catchper-unit effort (CPUE: 15. 3, 6. 0 and 5. 1 crayfish*trap− 1 * 24 h− 1 compared to 0. 2 − 4. 4, 2. 9 and 1. 7 crayfish*trap− 1 * 24 h− 1 by the <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gear in the pond, reed bed and grassland respectively). The SCG trap was also the most effective for sampling all size classes, especially small individuals (carapace length <= 30 mm). Sex ratio was balanced in all cases. SCG could be considered as appropriate trapping gear to likely give more realistic information about P. clarkii population characteristics than many other trap types. Further investigation is needed to assess the catching effort required for ultimately proposing a standardised sampling method in a large range of habitats...|$|E
40|$|For many years, Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) has {{maintained}} an active portfolio of projects examining co-management and community-based management in fisheries and other resource systems. Since {{the publication of}} Managing Small-scale Fisheries (Berkes et al., 2001), {{there has been an}} increasing demand for guidance on what IDRC has learned about co-management, particularly across different geographical settings, socio-economic conditions, and histories of operation; and how it could apply to <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing,</b> link to other livelihoods, relate to other dynamic processes (such as the migration of fishermen), and respond to the seasonal nature of fish resources. This book attempts to respond to this demand by compiling recent experience from as wide a cross section of research as possible. During the development of this book, both IDRC and the authors wrestled with the concept of co-management. Given the evolving nature of this science, for example, what does co-management cover and how widely is the concept accepted? Importantly, there has been increasing acceptance of the idea that co-management is not an end point but rather a process [...] a process of adaptive learning. Recognizing the diversity of both local contexts (ecological and social) and factors depleting the fishery (such as overfishing and habitat destruction), however, would it even be possible to put together a book of lessons learned? As you will soon discover, IDRC and the authors felt that it was neither possible nor desirable to produce a blueprint for fishery co-management. Rather, we agreed that it would be more useful to document the co-management process, as undertaken by both IDRC partners and others, and to put this experience into a form that could be shared with anyone interested in learning more about co-management and what others have learned. This shared and adaptive approach to learning is what this book is all about. In the pages that follow, you will find a complete picture of the co-management process: strengths, weaknesses, methods, activities, checklists and so on...|$|E
