5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E

5|$|The last of {{the murders}} in the Whitechapel file was {{committed}} on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2:15am at Swallow Gardens, a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor wounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, {{from left to right}} and then back again. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5am. A man named James Sadler, who had been seen with Coles earlier, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts {{at the time of the}} previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, a {{case study}} of a woman with ulcers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> leg {{reported}} as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic pemphigus. This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of PNP. The article warned clinicians to be alert to the possibility that paraneoplastic pemphigus in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood pathogenesis of PNP.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

500|$|In 1870, aged eleven, Ellen {{began work}} as a nursemaid in nearby Marlow, but she began {{suffering}} periods of somnolence and her employment was terminated.

Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits {{that her mother was}} black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E

Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics.

First Lady press secretary Liz Carpenter heard the laugh and swore it was Jackson's, and Mary Todd Lincoln claimed to have heard the stomping and swearing of an invisible presence which she claimed was the uncouth Jackson. White House seamstress Lillian Rogers Parks said she was sewing in the Queen's Bedroom and felt a presence, cold air, and then a hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair. She quickly left the room, and for the rest of her time in the White House she refused to enter the room again without at least one other person accompanying her. The spirit of William Henry Harrison, it is claimed, haunts the attic, and President John Tyler allegedly haunts the Blue Room. First Lady Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was married to President Grover Cleveland in the White House's Blue Room in 1886, is widely claimed to haunt the room where she was married and was seen there after her death in 1947.|$|E
