5|$|Changes in the line-up of the band, due {{not only}} to its musical {{direction}} but also to external events, mark this album as {{a turning point in}} the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from What We Did <b>on</b> <b>Our</b> Holidays to Liege & Lief within twelve months represented a major development.|$|E
5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back and resume command over it. America should only be ruled by the natives when there is no longer a Spaniard there.

5|$|Unhalfbricking is {{the third}} album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their second album {{released}} in 1969.
