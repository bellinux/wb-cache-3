40|$|Background: Deep {{sedation}} {{or general}} anesthesia is usually required for Magnetic Resonance Imaging when patients cannot remain motionless in the suite. Various anesthetic devices {{have been used}} to maintain the airway and ventilate the lungs during this period. Some of them produce artifacts that pose difficulties in the interpretation of images. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the devices that produced artifacts during Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Methods: Twelve anesthetic devices were considered: <b>oro-pharyngeal</b> <b>airway,</b> naso-pharygeal airway, face mask with reservoir bag, nasal cannula, endotracheal tube...|$|E
40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is {{regarded}} as a potentially life threatening breathing disorder characterised by periodic cessation of air intake during sleep. Treatment modalities include conservative measures such as weight loss, change in sleep position and avoidance of alcohol: these may suffice in reducing airway obstruction. Pharmacotherapy has also been used with various grades of success. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) helps maintain airway patency during sleep by a continuous stream of air under light pressure. Tracheostomy, by its very nature, completely bypasses any pharyngeal obstruction but is associated {{with a high degree of}} morbidity. Other surgical procedures such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), orthognathic surgery, hyoid-myotomy suspension and tongue reduction have also been used. Mandibular advancement splints (MAS) are increasingly being recognised as a suitable management option for those subjects with mild to moderate OSA. A study was undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of using mandibular advancement splints in the treatment of OSA. Mandibular protrusion using a MAS is frequently, but not invariably, associated with improvement in velo- and <b>oro-pharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> dimensions in awake subjects...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{there is}} a {{relationship}} between the mode of breathing and antero-posterior jaw relation. Severe mandibular deficiency has been linked to reduced <b>oro-pharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> dimension (OAW). Dental literature reported many studies on functional appliances and their effects, but there are few published studies on their effects on the airway. Design: prospective analytical (comparative) study. Setting: orthodontic clinics at university of Khartoum and university of Science and Technology. Objectives: to investigate the immediate effect of the Twin block (TB) functional appliance in the airway on patients with class II division 1 (div 1) malocclusion and to measure the immediate changes in the position of the hyoid bone after insertion of the TB appliance. Materials and Methods: two lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken and analyzed one before and second after insertion of the TB appliance for the 19 patients with class II div 1 malocclusion. The age range was 10 - 14 years. Immediate change in the airway was performed by measuring the change in the vertical position of the hyoid bone relative to the mandibular plane (H 1) and to the (cv 3 -RGN) plane (H 2). The change in the airway can be measured by the change in the vertical position of the hyoid bone before and after insertion of TB appliance (H 1 +H 2).

The mean of the change was 11. 8 mm, with SD 2. 8 mm (p= 0. 0001) at 0. 01 % level. Conclusion: the vertical hyoid bone position was changed in amore superior position immediately after the insertion of the TB appliance on patients with class II div 1 malocclusion. Further, the TB has an immediate positive effect in the airwa...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Recent {{studies have}} {{utilised}} cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) {{for the assessment}} of the volume of the nasopharyngeal airway space (Guijarro-Martínez and Swennen, 2013, Lenza et al., 2010, Woodside and Linder-Aronson, 1979, Chang et al., 2013). Some of these investigations are based on the analysis of slice data obtained from three dimensional (3 D) radiographic images. The usage of a CBCT scan to measure the nasopharyngeal airway volume has drawbacks which include the effect of respiration and tongue position (Abbott et al., 2004), the impact of head posture, lordosis (cranio-cervical inclination) and mandibular morphology on the accuracy of measuring air <b>oro-pharyngeal</b> <b>airways.</b> In addition, published figures to date has not considered the detailed anatomical boundaries of the nasal cavity space, paranasal airway space and other pharyngeal sections collectively (Chang et al., 2013). Aims and objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the validity of the free access software package like ITK Snap in measuring the airways spaces, investigate, using CBCT, the three-dimensional effect of rapid maxillary expansion on the maxillary sinus, the lower part of the nasal cavity, the upper nasopharynx and the upper oropharynx (upper and lower retropalatal spaces), and to correlate the changes in these anatomical spaces with the measured RME appliance split, the dentoalveolar expansion and the gender of the subjects. Materials and methods: This study was carried out on seventeen patients (8 boys, 9 girls; mean age 12. 6 + 1. 8 years) who required maxillary expansion for the management of narrow upper dental arch. Sample size was calculated using the Researcher’s Toolkit calculator and this indicated that a sample size of 14 patients would produce an Alpha error level or confidence level at 95...|$|R
