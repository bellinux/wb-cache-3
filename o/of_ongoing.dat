Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders have both described him as being targeted by Bahraini authorities for his human rights activities. In a postal campaign targeting Rajab and his wife thousands of letters were allegedly distributed.|$|E

5|$|Flight 007 {{has been}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> {{controversy}} and has spawned a number of conspiracy theories. Many of these are based on the suppression of evidence such as the flight data recorders, unexplained details such as the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft, the untimely destruction of the U.S. Air Force's King Salmon radar data, or merely Cold War disinformation and propaganda.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that fundamental constants such asc {{have the same}} value throughout spacetime, meaning {{that they do not}} depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that the speed of light may have changed over time. No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> research.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether triple-alpha helium fusion has started {{at the core of}} Eta Carinae A. The {{elemental}} abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% hydrogen and 40% helium, with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.|$|E

5|$|Several {{risk factors}} have been {{proposed}} and are the subject <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> research.

5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements.

Cyrtostylis.|$|E
5|$|The Eskaya {{community}} has been the object <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> controversy, particularly with regards to its status as an indigenous group and the classification of the Eskayan language.

5|$|The Eskayan {{writing system}} {{takes the form}} of a syllabary of over 1,000 characters, all modeled on parts of the human body {{including}} internal organs. This unique script has been compared variously to Phoenician, Etruscan, Hebrew, and even the undeciphered script of the Butuan paleograph. While there are no mother-tongue speakers of Eskayan, it is taught to both adults and children in volunteer-run cultural schools. The Eskayan language and script has been the object <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction.

5|$|This purported weapon {{has been}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> debate about its {{credibility}} since the Renaissance.

5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause <b>of</b> <b>ongoing</b> friction between the British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
