5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an <b>offer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E

His four-year term was marred by a change of government {{in the state in}} 1963, and his final years saw a series of clashes with the new governor, Karl F.

5|$|Curie and {{her husband}} {{declined}} to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an <b>offer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> University of Geneva, which offered Pierre a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still {{did not have a}} proper laboratory. Upon Pierre's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL lockout, {{as well as}} rib {{and knee}} {{injuries}} sustained during the 2004 World Cup, Jovanovski was inactive during the 2004–05 season. When the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Jovanovski was on pace for a career year, but his season was interrupted by groin, foot and abdominal injuries. He finished with 33 points in 44 games for a career-high 0.75 points-per-game average. The Canucks suffered from Jovanovski missing the final 27 {{games of the season}} and did not qualify for the 2006 playoffs. Following the 2005–06 season, Jovanovski did not receive a contract <b>offer</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Canucks, subsequently becoming an unrestricted free agent. The decision to let him go was influenced by the re-signings of Daniel and Henrik Sedin, as well as the acquisition of goaltender Roberto Luongo, leaving no room on the team's salary cap to retain Jovanovski.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s, Khoo tried {{to pursue a}} Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from various universities, {{but all of them}} {{rejected}} his application as he did not possess a first degree for admission.

Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered the job as Director of Operations for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).|$|E
