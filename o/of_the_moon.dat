5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis {{is that it was}} formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E

5|$|Filling {{the void}} left by Barrett's {{departure}} in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote {{the lyrics to}} the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with The Dark Side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since The Dark Side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The Dark Side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> {{was one of the}} most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark Side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.|$|E

5|$|In Aristotle's (384–322BC) {{description}} of the universe, the Moon marked {{the boundary between the}} spheres of the mutable elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries. However, in the , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun. In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance. These figures were greatly improved by Ptolemy (90–168AD): his values of a mean distance of 59times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292Earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively. Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> and other objects in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking {{the limits of the}} Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> See Moon for more details.|$|E
