5|$|This bill {{establishes}} {{a weapon of}} violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far worse than the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or {{the violence of the}} Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, and, through officiates in our Government, dominate <b>our</b> <b>politics.</b>|$|E

500|$|The former {{governor}} was enraged when in March 1890, Hanna {{gave a speech}} in New York stating, [...] "Foraker is dead {{as a factor in}} <b>our</b> <b>politics</b> and Ohio is again as reliable a Republican state as it ever was." [...] Foraker determined to secure election to the Senate; although the Democratic-controlled legislature had elected Calvin S. Brice to the Senate in 1890, Sherman's seat would be up for election in January 1892. [...] McKinley was defeated for re-election to Congress in November 1890; his stature in Ohio politics was not diminished by the loss, as he was seen as a victim of gerrymandering. [...] When the former congressman ran for governor the following year, he asked Foraker to place his name in nomination, which he did. [...] Although some saw this as a rapprochement between the Sherman and Foraker factions, the {{former governor}}'s supporters, such as Kurtz and millionaire Springfield manufacturer Asa Bushnell, were already campaigning for Foraker for Senate.|$|E

[...] Obama had begun distancing himself from Wright when he called his pastor {{the night before the}} February 2007 announcement of Obama's presidential candidacy to withdraw his request that Wright deliver an invocation at the event. However, Wright did attend the announcement, prayed with Obama beforehand, and was named to the Obama campaign's African American Religious Leadership Committee.

2500|$|The {{radical change}} in her views of women's role {{which took place in}} her work after her {{marriage}} in 1780 {{has been the subject of}} much debate. In her poem [...] ("Advice to my dear daughter, if I had one") and '', she advice women to renounce intellectual aspirations and focus on shaping their character morally to that on an ideal wife and mother. She advice women to concentrate on domestic tasks rather than attempt to meddle in intellectual or political pursuits, because [...] "Our household is our Republic; <b>our</b> <b>politics</b> is our appearance". She herself officially discontinued her career after her marriage by only publishing her works under anonymous pseudonyms and refusing to admit to them. However, Anna Maria Lenngren is famed for her great love for irony, which has created uncertainty about whether she meant what she said literary or if she wished to prove her point by irony. Her poem Dröm, which was given as a response to the admiration from the Academy in 1797, and in which she describe herself as unworthy, has also been interpreted as ironic in this regard.|$|E

In an in-depth review Spanos stated [...] "The album is a startlingly direct statement from a black female pop star, one that many are not afforded the opportunity to express. In the media, black women are often cast as either jezebels or mammies – oversexed or undersexed with no choice as to how they are received. Rihanna's resistance to typecasting and her positive affirmation of her sexual agency made her the year's slyest rebel, a maverick living life as she pleases." [...] Taj Rani of Billboard stated [...] "Work" [...] has brought the genre of dancehall to the forefront of American music, as it became the first dancehall song to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Sean Paul's [...] "Temperature" [...] reached the feat in 2006.

6000|$|Somehow {{there always}} seems to be a {{peculiar}} interest about English political questions that we don't find elsewhere. At home in Canada <b>our</b> <b>politics</b> turn on such things as how much money the Canadian National Railways lose as compared with how much they could lose if they really tried; on whether the Grain Growers of Manitoba should be allowed to import ploughs without paying a duty or to pay a duty without importing the ploughs. Our members at Ottawa discuss such things as highway subsidies, dry farming, the Bank Act, and the tariff on hardware. These things leave me absolutely cold. To be quite candid there is something terribly plebeian about them. In short, <b>our</b> <b>politics</b> are what we call in French [...] "peuple." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} is a pity that our authors do not go into {{politics}} at least {{for the sake of the}} material it would yield them; but really they do not. <b>Our</b> <b>politics</b> are often vulgar, but they are very picturesque; yet, so far, our fiction has shunned them even more decidedly than it has shunned our good society--which is not picturesque or apparently anything but a tiresome adaptation of the sort of drama that goes on abroad under the same name. In nearly the degree that our authors have dealt with <b>our</b> <b>politics</b> as material, they have given the practical politicians only too much reason to doubt their insight and their capacity to understand the mere machinery, the simplest motives, of political life.|$|E
