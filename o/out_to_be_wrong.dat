25|$|In 1985, after {{experiencing}} severe {{fatigue and}} suffering from {{pain in her}} upper legs {{on the set of}} Haunted Honeymoon in the United Kingdom, Radner sought medical treatment.

25|$|Despite Thi's good {{relations}} with the Buddhists in his area, most notably the leading activist monk Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monk's support for Thi's removal. If Kỳ thought that Thích Trí Quang would not organize demonstrations against Thi's dismissal, he turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> as the monk used to crisis to highlight Buddhist calls for civilian rule. There were claims that Thích Trí Quang had always intended to challenge Kỳ, {{regardless of whether or not}} Thi had been cast aside.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, John Nuckolls {{outlined}} {{the idea of}} ignition. This is a fusion chain reaction. Hot helium made during fusion reheats the fuel and starts more reactions. John argued that ignition would require lasers of about 1kJ. This turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> Nuckolls's paper started a major development effort. Several laser systems were built at LLNL. These included the argus, the Cyclops, the Janus, the long path, the Shiva laser and the Nova in 1984. This prompted the UK to build the Central Laser Facility in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong),</b> but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E

It was applauded [...] "both as a history lesson and as a film". Tobias Kniebe of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as [...] "maybe not the masterpiece we might have dreamed of ... but not much less", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public-service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie [...] "neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century....

2500|$|In 1994 a [...] (PUA) (parliamentary {{commission}} of enquiry) was installed after {{the resignation of}} the State Minister for the Interior Werner Hackmann, because of several accusations of xenophobia, with assaults and alleged police brutality. The commission was in existence for over two years— the longest term in Hamburg's history to date. In 1996 the findings stated that right wing extremist events in the police were no individual cases. During the investigations, State Police Colonel Heinz Krappen resigned too, but some accusations turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> The whole incident is known as Hamburg police scandal, and a police complaints authority— to investigate independent and unprejudiced, and to break the [...] "wall of silence", which was often noticed during investigations within the police— was installed in 1998, but dissolved by Senator Ronald Schill in 2001.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, repeats were {{observed}} in the archaeal organisms of Haloferax and Haloarcula species, and their function was studied by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain. [...] Although his hypothesis turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> Mojica surmised {{at the time that}} the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in Haloferax volcanii. [...] Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time. [...] By 2000, Mojica's group had identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes. [...] In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who was searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.|$|E

50|$|Once a bold {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} mooted, Popper argues, scientists try {{to investigate and}} test how well the bold hypothesis {{can stand up to}} the known evidence, with the aim of finding counter-arguments which would refute or falsify the bold hypothesis.

Even if the bold hypothesis turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wrong,</b> testing it generates new knowledge about what can and cannot be the case.|$|R

Ιn The Washington Post, Erik Wemple wrote that the book's [...] "dynamic" [...] of [...] "Judy Miller against the world" [...] lends her book an aspect that is [...] "both depressing and desperate". A review in The Columbia Journalism Review called the book [...] "less a memoir than an apologia and an assault". In The Daily Beast, Lloyd Grove characterized Miller's work as [...] "self-pitying". Criticizing Miller's failure to fully {{take responsibility for the}} flaws in her reporting, Matt Taibbi wrote in Rolling Stone, [...] "Most of The Story is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller's homework.... Mostly, she just had a lot of rotten luck. Or at least, that's how it reads. It's a sweeping, epic non-apology.

In society he was constantly making mistakes, and setting people unintentionally by the ears together.
