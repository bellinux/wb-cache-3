5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, the situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> {{was similar to}} the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E

5|$|In September 1201 one of Coutances' suffragan bishops, Lisiard, the Bishop of Sées died. King John objected {{when the}} cathedral chapter {{attempted}} to elect {{one of their}} own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> of the Archdeacon of Sées, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees.|$|E
