5|$|The John Bull had {{remained}} on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance {{as one of}} the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.|$|E

The mass of a silicon atom could be determined using the Avogadro project and using Avogadro's number be linked directly to the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Chief makes {{contact with}} Infinity and helps repel the Didact's attack. Chief and Cortana {{recommend}} attacking the Didact {{while he is}} vulnerable, but Infinity captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so their ship can escape. In the process, Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian—the wife of the Didact, as well as ancient humanity's protector. She explains that the Forerunners were divided <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to combat the Flood. After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite, the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into mechanical Promethean Knights immune to infection. Requiring more soldiers, the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans, before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian. The Librarian, who has guided humanity's development, accelerates the Chief's evolution; this grants him immunity to the Composer.|$|E

Following their advice, Haakon has a wooden man (Old Norse trémaðr) built out of driftwood and endows it with a human heart.

5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to conceptualize and define the nature of language {{based on data from}} the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{may have}} {{expected}} Alexios to become their leader, {{but he had}} no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear fealty to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.|$|E

5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E
5|$|After the KCA raised {{sufficient}} funds, in February 1929 Kenyatta {{sailed to}} Britain from Mombasa. Grigg's administration could not legally prevent Kenyatta's journey but instructed London's Colonial Office not {{to meet with}} him. Arriving in London, Kenyatta initially stayed at the West African Students' Union premises in West London, where he met Ladipo Solanke. He then lodged with a prostitute; both this and Kenyatta's lavish spending brought concern {{from members of the}} Church Mission Society. His landlord subsequently impounded his belongings due to unpaid debt. In the city, Kenyatta met with W. McGregor Ross at the Royal Empire Society, with Ross briefing him <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to deal with the Colonial Office. Kenyatta became friends with Ross' family, and accompanied them to social events in Hampstead. He also contacted anti-imperialists active in Britain, including the League Against Imperialism, Fenner Brockway, and Kingsley Martin. Grigg was in London at the same time and, despite his opposition to Kenyatta's visit, agreed to meet with him at the Rhodes Trust headquarters in April. At the meeting, Kenyatta raised the land issue and the exile of Thuku, with the atmosphere between the two being friendly. However, following the meeting Grigg got Special Branch to begin monitoring Kenyatta.|$|E
5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Allied {{military}} representatives {{pushed to}} threaten the Ottoman government for the affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Kemal. The Allied Supreme Council, {{which at the time}} was working out the details to a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government, deliberated <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to respond. Some of the delegates present, including Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities, but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea. The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Kemal from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since the Ottoman government held no control over Kemal, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia. A decision was finally reached on 10 March. British, French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople, which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne's command on the morning of 16 March.|$|E
5|$|Purely natural {{sources were}} {{insufficient}} {{in some areas}} and additional steps taken to increase supplies. In New England, holes were drilled in the ice to promote the thickening of the surface. Alternatively, artificial lakes were created in some areas, and guidance was published <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to construct the dams that lay {{at the heart of}} these designs. Low-lying, boggy land was dammed and flooded in Maine {{towards the end of the}} century to meet surge demands, while pre-existing artificial mill ponds in Wisconsin turned out to be ideal for harvesting commercial ice. In Alaska, a large, shallow artificial lake covering around 40 acres (16 hectares) was produced in order to assist in ice production and harvesting; similar approaches were taken in the Aleutian islands; in Norway this was taken further, with a number of artificial lakes up to half a mile long built on farmland to increase supplies, including some built out into the sea to collect fresh water for ice.|$|E

5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>best</b> to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{specialised}} {{training was}} conducted from several schools. Anti-submarine training was provided from the Combined Anti-Submarine Training Centre at Maydown, beginning in May 1943. Air-Sea rescue schools {{were set up}} at Blackpool, equipped with Avro Ansons. Conversion units, such as No. 6 OTU, was detailed to provide conversion training for crews, who were to fly the Consolidated Liberator, Boeing Fortress and Handley Page Halifax. Training still remained below what was needed, owing to manpower requirements on the front line. It was not until October 1944, that it became widely accepted to give crews refresher training on new types of aircraft, that this practice became policy. Even so, one conversion course {{was all that was}} afforded to any crew. Increasing the training hours from 72 to 87 helped in some respects.
