5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle,</b> which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was sent}} back to Fresno on August 11 to make room for Brian Wilson on the roster. He {{returned}} in September, and he replaced Lowry (who was injured) in the rotation. He made four starts, but he lost three of them and had a 7.16 ERA in all four of them. After straining his left <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> in his fourth start, he was shut down {{for the rest of the}} season and replaced in the rotation by Travis Blackley. He finished the year 1–5 with a 5.88 ERA in thirty-three games (four starts).|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} number of myogenin-positive {{activated}} satellite cells in the inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the medial muscles of V-pattern exotropia with inferior oblique overaction, to further explore the possible etiological factors of V-pattern exotropia with inferior oblique overaction. METHODS: The inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the medial muscles were cut from V-pattern exotropia patients with inferior oblique overaction during strabismus operation treated as the strabismus group. Cross sections were stained immunohistochemically {{for the presence of}} activated satellite cells, as identified by myogenin immunoreactivity. The inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the medial muscles were obtained from the corneal transplant donors(six eyes of six cases), which treated as the control group. RESULTS: The frequency of myogenin-positive satellite cells of the inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> was(22. 7 ± 7. 03) % and(4. 2 ± 0. 75) % in the strabismus group and the control group. Significant differences existed in the expression of myogenin in two groups(P P CONCLUSION: It is first report that myogenin-positive satellite cells presents in extraocular muscles of V-pattern exotropia with inferior oblique overaction.

5|$|He {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list after he incurred a strained <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> during the third inning of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five-decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5–0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{strained}} an <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> in 2011 {{spring training}} {{and opened the}} season on the DL. He was activated from the DL on April 6. After posting a 3.75 ERA {{in his first two}} games, Wilson posted a 1.26 ERA in his next 35 outings. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for a second straight game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2006–07 season, {{he scored}} his first NHL goal on October 13, 2006, against Vesa Toskala {{in a loss}} to the San Jose Sharks. Bieksa rapidly {{developed}} {{into one of the}} Canucks' top blueliners and finished the season leading all team defencemen with 30 assists, 42 points and 134 penalty minutes, while also tallying a career-high 12 goals. Paired with stay-at-home defenceman Willie Mitchell, he was also regularly given a shutdown role against opposing teams' top forwards. At the end of his first full NHL season, he was awarded the Canucks' Babe Pratt Trophy as best defenceman and Fred J. Hume Award as the unsung hero. In Bieksa’s first NHL playoff game he had just over 55 mins of ice time in a quadruple Overtime victory against the Dallas Stars. Later in the series Bieksa suffered three stomach <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> tears in Game 6 sidelining him for five games, before the Canucks were eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in the second round.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} {{described}} TAP block, a blunt needle was introduced blindly through the external {{and the internal}} <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles,</b> guided by the double- pop technique. The local anesthetic was injected between the transverse abdominis and the internal <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> This method has resulted in some penetrative injuries, and sometimes, it fails to gain the proper anesthetic effect [5]. Recently, ultrasound-guided TAP block has increased the efficacy and safety of the procedure through visualization of the needle tip and the local anesthetic injection site [12]. But, the technique needs great skills also; minimal complications have been described [13].|$|R
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the amount of tension present after incision and undermining of the anterior rectus sheaths and the external <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> in 20 fresh adult cadavers. Resistance to traction of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths towards the midline was measured at three stages of dissection: before any aponeurotic undermining; after incision and undermining of the anterior rectus sheaths; and after incision and undermining of the external <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> associated with the previous dissection. Significance of differences was assessed using non-parametric tests. There was {{a significant reduction in}} tension in the anterior and posterior sheaths on both levels after each stage of dissection. the incision and undermining of the anterior rectus sheaths and the external <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> promoted a progressive reduction in tension at the aponeurotic edges of the abdominal wall.

40|$|Abstract. Abdominal hypaxial {{muscles of}} male anurans {{function}} in vocalization by causing forcible expulsion of pulmonary air through the larynx. The hypaxial muscles were {{studied in the}} leopard frog, Rana pipiens, to test whether functions of these muscles in males are reflected in sexual dimorphism and in androgen responsiveness. The combined abdominal <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> and the rectus abdominis showed significant sexual dimorphism in wet mass and dry mass. However, the abdominal <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles</b> were less concentrated in protein content in males than in females. In overwintering males, exogenous testosterone cypionate stimulated {{a significant increase in}} mass and protein content of the abdominal oblique and rectus abdominis muscles.

Belisario remained stuck in Venezuela indefinitely, missing the entire season. The Dodgers also made news {{on the first day}} of camp by naming Clayton Kershaw as the opening day starting pitcher. The Dodgers pitching depth took a major hit when Vicente Padilla underwent surgery to repair a radial nerve injury and Jon Garland suffered a strained <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle.</b> The spring training injury problems continued with both third baseman Casey Blake and catcher Dioner Navarro suffering injuries that would keep them off the opening day roster.|$|E
25|$|Roddick {{withdrew from}} the Legg Masson Tennis Classic, and Rogers Cup, after {{partially}} tearing his <b>oblique</b> <b>muscle</b> while practicing.

This loss made him drop out of the top 20 {{for the first time since}} August 2001. After suffering an early exit at Cincinnati, Roddick played at the Winston-Salem Open in North Carolina, where he was the top seed after the withdrawal of the top-ranked American Mardy Fish. Roddick lost in the semifinals to John Isner. Roddick was seeded 21st at the U.S. Open. He begun his campaign with a four-set win over fellow American Michael Russell. He then defeated another American Jack Sock in straight sets. In the third round, he defeated Julien Benneteau, also in straight sets. He then backed it up with a four-set win over David Ferrer to advance to his first Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 2010 Australian Open. He eventually fell to world No. 2 Rafael Nadal.|$|E

Dyslexics presented a low-level (always < 1  prism diopter) VH combined with torsion. This oculomotor feature clearly separates the dyslexic group from the normal readers group. It is independent of the type of dyslexia. The essential feature of this VH is a lability that appears during specific stimulation of sensory receptors involved in postural regulation. This lability is demonstrated using a vertical Maddox test conducted under very specific conditions in which postural sensors are successively stimulated in a predetermined order. A quantitative variation in this VH may be seen during the Bielchowsky Head Tilt Test, which reveals hypertonia of the lower or upper <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> Vertical orthophoria can be achieved by placing low-power prisms asymmetrically within the direction of action of the superior or inferior <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> The selection of power and axis is not only guided by elements of the eye examination but also from observation of postural muscle tone. All these elements suggest that the VH could be of postural origin and somehow related to the vertical action of the <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles.</b> VH and torsion are not harmful per se. There is no statistical relationship between their level and the various parameters used to assess the reading skills of dyslexic children. VH and torsion could be a clinical marker of global proprioceptive dysfunction responsible for high-level multisensory disturbances secondary to poor spatial localization of visual and auditory information. This dysfunction might also explain the motor disorders concomitant to dyslexia. Keywords: dyslexia, proprioception, ocular torsion, postural control, <b>oblique</b> <b>muscles,</b> pris...|$|R
