After a 3–0 loss on July 24 to Sporting Kansas City, in which the Sounders had only <b>one</b> <b>shot,</b> Schmid left the club on mutual terms.|$|E
5|$|However, Larson's {{streak of}} hitting his marks every time {{stretched}} {{the length of}} the episode well past the usual thirty minutes and the producers were unsure how to proceed. While the entire episode was recorded in <b>one</b> <b>shot,</b> the production staff decided that it would need to be split up for airing.|$|E
5|$|Prior to a 2006 {{match against}} Arminia Bielefeld in Munich, Michael Rensing {{peppered}} Kahn with practice shots. <b>One</b> <b>shot</b> hit Kahn {{squarely in the}} eye, causing enough swelling and discoloration {{to keep him from}} playing. With Rensing in goal, Bayern Munich won the match 2–0.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene where}} Saul Tigh has {{the vision of}} {{shooting}} William Adama was not filmed in <b>one</b> <b>shot,</b> but was edited {{in such a way}} that the cut would only become noticeable if one looks at the scene closely. Moore considered cutting the scene despite loving it, but eventually decided to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E

50|$|Two {{music videos}} were <b>shot.</b> The first <b>one</b> was <b>shot</b> with Angélica Rivera, {{while the second}} <b>one</b> was <b>shot</b> dancing in a bridge. The second one was {{included}} in Grandes Exitos Videos.|$|R

5|$|In <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> Guinness {{appears as}} seven of his {{characters}} at {{once in a}} single frame. This was accomplished by masking the lens. The film was re-exposed several times with Guinness in different positions over several days. Douglas Slocombe, the cinematographer {{in charge of the}} effect, recalled sleeping in the studio to make sure nobody touched the camera.|$|E
5|$|Lenalee {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{characters}} Hoshino created for the manga, most notably before the series' protagonist, Allen Walker. She originated in Hoshino's <b>one</b> <b>shot,</b> Zone, where she is depicted as a teenager who wants the Earl to revive her boyfriend. Hoshino's design changes across the D.Gray-man series led to arguments between Hoshino and her editor who argued how Lenalee's hairstyle should look.|$|E
5|$|On one occasion, the Cable Junction Island set, {{which was}} built on a barge, broke loose from its {{anchorage}} {{and had to be}} rescued. Szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards Cuba. Real hammerhead sharks circled the teen actors during the filming of <b>one</b> <b>shot.</b> Because the characters they were playing were meant to be in distress, the crew (filming from a distance) did not realize that the actors were genuinely calling for help.|$|E
50|$|The {{name was}} used to claim another two attacks on 20 August 2001. In <b>one,</b> <b>shots</b> were fired at a house in Cloughmills {{and in the other}} a pipe bomb was thrown at a Protestant home in Ballymena.|$|R

5|$|Other than Belushi's opening yell, {{the food}} fight was filmed in <b>one</b> <b>shot,</b> with the actors {{encouraged}} {{to fight for}} real. Flounder's groceries handling in the supermarket was another single shot; Furst deftly caught the many items Landis and Matheson threw at him, amazing the director. By filming the long courtroom scene in one day Landis won a bet with Reitman.|$|E
5|$|Salo {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman, capable of being matched up against {{opposing}} team's top players, while also contributing offensively. His offensive game is characterized by his powerful slapshot. He has won numerous hardest shot titles with the Canucks in the team's SuperSkills competitions, clocking <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> at 102.7 miles-per-hour (163.5 kph) in 2012. As a result, he is used frequently on the powerplay, being set up by teammates for shots from the point. A well-rounded defenceman, Salo also earns time on the penalty kill.|$|E
5|$|Swanigan {{chose to}} major in general education/educational studies. Swanigan chose the number 50 to honor his father who had died, as that was his age when he died. Swanigan started every game his {{freshman}} year. His highest scoring game was in a win against Wisconsin in Purdue's last regular season game, where he scored 27 points and missed only <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> from the field.

50|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to promote the}} single. During the filming of the video, one of the lead singers, Annikafiore managed to break her foot. Therefore, she was only shown in certain scenes of the music video (the <b>ones</b> <b>shot</b> before the injury).|$|R
5000|$|Though not {{directly}} related to Marvel Zombies, Marvel Apes was first suggested as a successor to Marvel Zombies by a fan during a convention Q&A session with Joe Quesada. [...] All of the following <b>one</b> <b>shots</b> are resolved with the aforementioned Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution.|$|R
5|$|The opening scene, which {{depicts the}} system driving {{reporter}} Jo Nakashima into the canal, was filmed at Cardiff's docks. The scene {{was the first}} time a car-cannon had been used since 2005, and was required to be completed in <b>one</b> <b>shot.</b> The car fired into the canal was removed immediately afterwards to clear the shipping route. Scenes at the Rattigan Academy were filmed at Margam Country Park, Port Talbot from 23 to 26 October 2007. The London skyline and gas were added in post-production by The Mill.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} Kirk and Scott {{approaching}} the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty-five different shots—averaging <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk {{to make its}} flight from the space office complex to the docking ring. Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of the pod traveling to the Enterprise, close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots lookalike puppets were used.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
25|$|Dark Horse {{published}} two Angel comic series, {{the first}} of which was halted after 17 issues while the second lasted only four issues. Since June 2005, IDW have published a 17-issue limited series, a spin-off ongoing series as well as several miniseries and <b>one</b> <b>shots</b> with Angel characters.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} {{music videos}} {{were made for}} the promotion of the song: <b>one</b> was <b>shot</b> in 2004 in the UK to promote it internationally; the other <b>one</b> was <b>shot</b> in New York in 2006 to promote the single in North America.

5|$|As with {{previous}} Star Trek films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though The Voyage Home required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from The Search for Spock, although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics—the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock {{footage of the}} destruction of the Enterprise and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge was a completely new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in The Wrath of Khan. After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted white for <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> that transitioned into a dream sequence during the time travel.|$|E
5|$|In May 1915, Hamilton {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} his {{resources in the}} Helles sector. Birdwood withdrew Colonel McCay's 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and they moved by sea to Cape Helles on 6 May. During the subsequent Second Battle of Krithia the two brigades suffered 1,827 casualties, including McCay, in an ill-advised daylight advance over open ground {{that could have been}} occupied after dark without loss. During May Turkish snipers were particularly active in Monash Valley. On 15 May, <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> and fatally wounded Major General Bridges. His body was returned to Australia and buried on the hill overlooking Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra. The Australian government sent Major General James Gordon Legge from Australia to replace him.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. <b>One</b> <b>shot</b> to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} [...] "Clone Sagas": the {{original}} storyline in the 1970s {{and the second}} saga which consumed all the regular Spider-Man series, several limited series and <b>one</b> <b>shots</b> between 1994 and 1997. Between the two, there were also two smaller storylines that dealt with elements from the original saga.|$|R
