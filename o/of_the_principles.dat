40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} into <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason. My original contribution is the claim that in David Hume 2 ̆ 7 s writing on causality we find an implicit treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason. While Hume does not explicitly accept or deny <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason, my claim is that in analyzing causality, Hume also provides us with an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason, since causality may be understood as <b>the</b> empirical manifestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason. I support my claim about Hume by presenting two opposed views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason, that of Leibniz and Schopenhauer. In my exegesis of Leibniz and Schopenhauer, I show how Leibniz 2 ̆ 7 s presentation treats <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> sufficient reason as legitimately metaphysical, and Schopenhauer in his dissertation, On <b>the</b> Fourfold Root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Sufficient Reason, treats <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> as a merely transcendental principle.

Although Gandhi wanted a total focus {{on the task of}} winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite Gandhi's opposition, Bose won a second term as Congress President, against Gandhi's nominee, Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya; but left the Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> introduced by Gandhi.

He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L.

5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from {{a small number of}} trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{processes}} <b>of</b> {{integration and}} harmonization of European contract law are the positive tendencies in <b>the</b> modern development <b>of</b> different national legal systems. <b>The</b> general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law should become <b>the</b> unifying elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern European contract law; one <b>of</b> those <b>principles</b> is <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith. Therefore, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this Master's Thesis was to research understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good {{faith in the}} European and international legislation and legal practices; the focus {{was made in the}} contract law and international trade.   <b>The</b> theory part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research, which performed after orientation to the subject and identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theoretical backgrounds, is based on literary research and overview of national legislation and legal practices of European countries. It presents <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> historical development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith, <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> in legal doctrine, and <b>the</b> overview <b>of</b> differences and similarities in the legislative consolidation and <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith among European counties. Eight European countries were analyzed; the countries were chosen from different legal families, due to specialties in <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith. In the practical part, <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith was researched in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European and international legal acts, <b>the</b> judgments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Human Rights, and preliminary rulings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Justice. About 60 cases of European courts and 13 legal acts were analyzed in the study to obtain sufficient amount <b>of</b> information. <b>The</b> judgments were grouped in accordance with <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith. Such grouping helped to detect <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> application and <b>the</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith.

It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981).

5|$|With the {{commencement}} of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire, {{it became clear that}} the three hospital ships currently serving Australia—Manunda, Wanganella, and Oranje—would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia, so a new hospital ship was required. Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a hospital ship, and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943. The conversion work began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian Hospital Ship on 1 March. During her conversion, Centaur was painted with the markings of a hospital ship as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ("Adaptation to Maritime War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Principles</b> of the Geneva Convention"); white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's status would be visible from both sea and air, and an identification number (for Centaur, 47) on her bows. At night, the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights. Data on the ship's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943, who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February. This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.|$|E
