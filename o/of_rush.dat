5|$|Machine Head's sixth studio album, titled The Blackening, was {{released}} in North America on March 27, 2007. It entered the Billboard 200 at number 53, the highest charting position for the band at that time, with first-week sales of 15,000. It also made the top 20 in several European countries. Robb Flynn stated during an interview that the band are fans <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> and received {{a great deal of}} influence from their album A Farewell to Kings while creating The Blackening.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} town <b>of</b> <b>Rush,</b> NY251 widens from two to four lanes and meets I-390 at exit11. Just east of the freeway, NY251 intersects NY15, which is also served by exit11 {{by way of a}} pair of short collector/distributor roads {{paralleling}} I-390 from NY251 to NY15. Past NY15, the route reverts to a two-lane highway and veers southeast to parallel Honeoye Creek into the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Rush.</b> Here, the route passes through a more populated area as it intersects NY15A {{in the center of the}} community, at which point it becomes Rush–Mendon Road. NY251 continues to follow Honeoye Creek through progressively less developed areas and into the town of Mendon, where the creek curves southward toward Honeoye Falls at Rochester Junction. The highway, however, turns northeastward to meet NY65 at a roundabout. The northeasterly routing of NY251 continues to Mendon Center, a small hamlet near the southern tip of Mendon Ponds Park, where it turns eastward once more.|$|E
5|$|The Magnificent Mile, {{sometimes}} referred to as The Mag Mile, is an upscale section of Chicago's Michigan Avenue, running from the Chicago River to Oak Street in the Near North Side. The district is located adjacent to downtown, and one block east <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> Street. The Magnificent Mile serves as the main thoroughfare between Chicago's Loop business district and its Gold Coast. It is generally the western boundary of the Streeterville neighborhood, to its east and River North to the west.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} incorporated city of Chicago in 1837, Rush Street is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares. Like Clark Street, parts <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> Street roughly follow the path of an Indian trail called Green Bay trail (later Green Bay Road) that ran to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Early Rush Street was commonly agreed to be desirable place of residence, and hosted the first house designed by an architect in Chicago (designed for the first Mayor of Chicago William Ogden by John M. Van Osdel). The house, bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, did not survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.|$|E
5|$|CMLL {{appeared}} to waver about the winner becoming the champion or just joining Stuka and Metro for a title match. CMLL's website indicated Delta won the championship, but Delta's team did not wear the championship belts {{prior to their}} first title match. Concurrent with the poll, CMLL started running an eight-team, three-week tournament to find new challengers for the new champions. Guadalajara regulars Palacio Negro, and Metal Blanco made their Mexico City debuts and qualified for the finals alongside Sagrado, but the team <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> and the two poll losers, Ángel de Oro and Diamante, won the tournament and {{would go on to}} win the championship.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built {{using a combination}} of cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after the construction of the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street Line side, the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a false ceiling was placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street Line side, the southern side. Finishing touches were only applied to the IND side of the station. The tracks on the closed-off BMT side were used only to store trains outside <b>of</b> <b>rush</b> hour.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the success}} <b>of</b> Moving Pictures, <b>Rush</b> {{released}} their second live recording, Exit...Stage Left, in 1981. More than anything else, the album delineates the apex <b>of</b> <b>Rush's</b> progressive period featuring live {{material from the}} band's Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures tours. As with their first live release, Exit...Stage Left identified the margin of yet another chapter <b>of</b> <b>Rush's</b> sound. The band underwent another radical stylistic transmutation {{with the release of}} Signals in 1982.|$|R

5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and claret jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> at the oars of an outrigger skiff. The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|NY251 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY383 {{in the center}} of the village of Scottsville, located within the town of Wheatland. It departs Scottsville to the south as River Road and crosses over Oatka Creek before meeting Quaker Road at a rural intersection just south of the village. While River Road continues southward as the unsigned NY940H, NY251 turns east to begin its east–west trek across the mostly undeveloped southern portion of Monroe County. After roughly , it crosses over the Genesee River and into the town <b>of</b> <b>Rush,</b> becoming Rush–Scottsville Road in the process. Just inside the town line, NY251 passes through the hamlet of Industry, a location centered around NY251's grade crossing with the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad and the adjacent Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum.|$|E

Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart <b>of</b> <b>Rush.</b> Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. John Allison of BB and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and John P. Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.|$|E

5|$|Readville is a {{passenger}} rail station located slightly northwest of Wolcott Square in the Readville {{section of the}} Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It serves multiple lines on the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) Commuter Rail system, {{with access to the}} Fairmount Line and Franklin Line on separate platforms. Readville is the terminus of the Fairmount Line, although a small number <b>of</b> <b>rush</b> hour trains continue through the station to and from the Franklin Line. The station has platforms in place on the Northeast Corridor, but they are not used by Providence/Stoughton Line trains except during service disruptions.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} allegations <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU {{argued that}} his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, Rush’s son, Huey, was murdered, leading Obama {{to put his}} {{campaign}} on hold. Governor George Ryan called the Illinois Legislature to a special session to re-enact a package of gun-safety bills, a pet issue <b>of</b> <b>Rush,</b> which had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Obama supported the package, but the session dragged on towards Christmas. Obama annually spent the Christmas vacation in Hawaii with his family visiting his grandmother, who raised him. Obama left Illinois, expecting the session would continue into January. However, a crucial vote took place earlier than expected, failing by five votes with Obama and others absent. Obama came under fire for missing the vote though {{he said he would}} have flown back sooner, but his 18-month-old daughter was sick. Meanwhile, Rush received an outpouring of sympathy that aided {{his campaign}}.|$|E

5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E
5|$|Progressive rock {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is {{at least in part}} due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements <b>of</b> <b>Rush,</b> the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie Dregs. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{arrived in}} Sydney in 1861 {{at the age}} of 16, an {{assisted}} immigrant brought to augment Australia's mostly agricultural workforce. Rush was a farm labourer, who knew nothing of boats or boating, but within ten years of his arrival in Australia, Rush was Champion Sculler of the Clarence River, as well as a selector, cattle-raiser and butcher. His interest in the sport of rowing dominated Rush's life, and hampered his prosperity. He repeatedly travelled from his Clarence River home to compete for large money prizes on Sydney's Parramatta River, neglecting his business affairs. Rush became Champion Sculler of Australia in 1873, and defended his championship several times, not always successfully. Rush succeeded on a few occasions in having the Championship venue moved from Sydney to the Clarence River, the first to shift the focus of sculling away from the capital city. From 1874, there was talk <b>of</b> <b>Rush</b> travelling to England to compete for the World Sculling Championship, but this did not eventuate. Instead, Edward Trickett won the World Championship on the Thames in 1876. Rush and Trickett in 1877 competed on the Parramatta River for the World Championship, but Rush lost this race.|$|E
