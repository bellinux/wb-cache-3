40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} to what extent leadership is valued by followers during a period of organisational change This research study will research various leadership frameworks gain the opinions of individuals regarding attributes that are widely considered essential for a leader to possess, and how 1. Establish to what extent classic leadership frameworks are relevant to contemporary leaders within NHS Lothian. 2. Establish the opinion of change from those working within the Adult Mental Health (AMH) service for NHS Lothian as it experiences a period of <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure.</b> Design/Methodology/Approach – Quantitative questionnaires were chosen as the appropriate research instrument for this research study, in order to gather opinions of participants involved. A pilot study was conducted to ensure the questionnaires would provide valid and reliable results. A total of 50 questionnaires were distributed with 31 returned and useable. SPSS, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word were all used to analyse and present the data. Findings – The main findings of the research established a set of eight attributes that the participants felt were essential for a leader to possess during a period of organisational change. The data collected also illustrated that participants within the AMH service accept that change within their derive is necessary, feel incentivised and motivated to implement changes that may come about as a result of the <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure.</b> However, unexpectedly, data was inconclusive when attempting to establish if those within the service consider themselves as leaders. Practical Implications – The results show that effective communication of proposed changes is imperative, in order for individuals expected to implement the changes to feel motivated. Research Limitations – This study gathered data from the AMH service within NHS Lothian, therefore, results are not applicable to other regions or services. Originality/ Value – This paper is thought to be the only paper to examine leadership during a period of organisational change within the AMH service of NHS Lothian...|$|R

Developed within an organisational climate of managerial and institutional change, the development of this VIS is innovative on two counts. Firstly for raising awareness and appreciation of the potential offered by thinking about design not simply as a provider of graphic elements but as a provider of strategic communication systems. Secondly its use of a participatory process that brought museum staff from all levels into the design studio to be not only involved in the design process but also encounter at first hand the nature of design practice and thinking. The paper demonstrates how this process ensured the successful implementation of the new VIS and with this, a fundamental change within the Museum's organisational culture together with a shift in attitude towards the potential usefulness of design...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} {{by now that}} most change initiatives are unsuccessful even though more organisations are experiencing change as they fight to retain and improve their competitiveness in the market place. It is against this background of change failure that researchers have looked for new strategies to improve change outcomes. Theoretical models conceptualising the dynamic change process advise on better change strategies, but little empirical evidence has demonstrated that these models are effective in improving change implementation outcomes. Theoretical models were also developed to counter change resistance, but little emphasis {{has been placed on}} employee change readiness. Some empirical research on employee change readiness explores employees' perception of organisational readiness, but no empirical research has explored employee readiness from a psychological perspective. That is, how to create change readiness in employees. This thesis has contributed to both the theoretical and empirical understanding of the change readiness model. Firstly, the theoretical readiness for change model Armenakis et al. 's (1993, 2002) was extended by the inclusion of the 'understanding of the change' driver. Secondly, this change readiness model was empirically tested on two distinct <b>organisational</b> changes: <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure</b> and IT change. The extended model is also examined for two change stages of the dynamic process to identify which readiness drivers should be prioritised by change agents. Two online questionnaires were administered eight months apart assessing the responses to three change stages (planning, implementation and post-implementation) of employees - supervisors and subordinates - of a flat structured organisation in the human resource industry. At the two measurement points 189 and 141 employees returned completed surveys. Six employee readiness drivers were operationalised and regressed against behavioural change intention. The quantitative findings using regression models across two change types and longitudinally did not identify a specific change pattern. However, all six readiness drivers including the 'understanding of the change' driver were influential on employees' behavioural change intention. Furthermore, statistical differences between supervisors and subordinates were identified in the <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure</b> change. The quantitative findings using a triangulation approach with qualitative date including data from two unstructured interviews and employee comments further validated the quantitative findings. The thematic analysis of the employee comments enhanced the findings and identified employee specific concerns including information dissemination of the changes and a level of uncertainty. The findings supported Armenakis et al. 's (1993, 2002) theoretical contribution that change readiness drivers {{are an important part of}} the organisational change process explaining why employee do and do not change. The empirical application of readiness change driver evaluation during the dynamic change is supported as it permits change agents to directly monitor employees' readiness perception of a specific change target. This valuable information finds practical utilisation for change agents in providing targeted guidance and support for employees thus facilitating a greater likelihood of a positive change outcome. Implications of these findings and future research opportunities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Strategies to {{implement}} evidence-based practice have highlighted the bidirectional relationship of organisational change on organisational culture. The present study examined changes in perceptions of organisational culture in two {{community mental health}} services implementing cognitive therapies into routine psychosis care over 30 years. During {{the time of the}} study there were a number of shared planned and unplanned changes that the mental health services had to accommodate. One service, Metro South, had the additional challenge of embarking on a major <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure.</b> Methods A survey of organisational culture was administered to clinical staff of each service at yearly intervals over the 30 years. Results At baseline assessment there was no significant difference between the two services in organisational culture. At the midpoint assessment, which was conducted at the time the Metro South restructure was operationalized, there were less positive ratings of organisational culture recorded in Metro South compared to the other service. Organisational culture returned to near-baseline levels at endpoint assessment. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the literature that organisational culture is relatively robust and resilient. It is also consistent with the literature that, at any one time, a service or organisation may have a finite capacity to absorb change. Consequently this limitation needs to be taken into account in the timing and planning of major service reform where possible. The results also extend the literature, insofar as external factors with a high impact on the operation of an organisation may impact upon organisational culture albeit temporarily...|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} the ULMA Group {{date back to the}} early sixties and the {{creation}} of two separate cooperatives. The first was created in 1961 by six young mechanics following several meetings with José María Arizmendiarrieta, the local priest in Mondragón (Gipuzkoa) and the driving force behind what is today known as the Mondragon Corporation. They decided to set up a cooperative called ULMA S.C.I. to provide ancillary services to the chocolate industry and later on entered the construction sector. At the same time and in the same region, four workers from the Forjas de Zubillaga (Zubillaga Forge) company decided to acquire a locksmith and accessories workshop. Both companies grew and established close ties during the late seventies and eighties and finally created the actual group in 1987 with the addition of Oinakar, a third cooperative that sold forklift trucks.

40|$|CSIRO has {{undergone}} a major <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure,</b> aligning staff in functional groups; this has included some significant role redefinition. One such group is CSIRO Library Services Information Specialists. This group consists of the organisation’s information specialists who have developed enterprise wide services {{in a range of}} areas previously managed on a local or divisional level. These services include, but are not limited to, current awareness provision, subject portals, and publications management. Reports and publications are key outcomes of research and one of the measures used in determining performance and impact for benchmarking CSIRO nationally and internationally. Currently, there are 20 divisional publications databases being managed, generally by library staff, across the organisation. These dispersed databases underpin a wide range of reporting requirements, both internal and external. For historical reasons, there is some duplication and, therefore, some redundancy. The organisation has been lacking a single point of truth for its publications for some years, and a number of models exist for publication approval. The Enterprise Publications Repository Project was initiated to address some of these concerns, and to develop a repository to more widely disseminate the research output of CSIRO.

40|$|Organisational change, {{including}} <b>organisational</b> <b>restructures,</b> {{impact on}} the culture of organisations, often negatively. Negative organisational cultures impact on organisational performance. There is a myriad of literature pertaining to organisational change and organisational culture, however there is a relative scarcity of studies on how organisations can ensure change is successful and sustainable without impacting negatively on the culture and performance of the organisation. This study explores the links between a) how cultural change is best achieved, b) who is best to lead the change and c) what method should be utilised. The exploration results in a framework which can be utilised to minimise {{the negative impact of}} organisational change on organisational culture and organisational performance (although this is not tested here), by utilising the middle manager’s understanding and replication of positive deviance behaviours as an intervention to influence organisational culture positively. A longitudinal mixed methodology was undertaken to ascertain if middle managers in a New South Wales Local Government Organisation, undergoing major organisational change, could influence the organisational culture positively. The intervention of understanding and replicating positive deviance by middle managers was introduced through an action research process. To verify if the intervention resulted in a positive organisational culture, baseline and post-test cultural analysis was undertaken utilising the Organisational Culture Index tool. The practical and theoretical outcomes of the study are significant for organisations. First, this study demonstrates to organisations that extensive change is possible while maintaining, or even improving organisational culture. These benefits are achieved through the use of positive deviance, the application of which is discussed in this thesis. Second, the paper provides a contribution to theory through the discovery of a potential Australian social effect which should be considered when developing a cultural change design.

The current body of knowledge is limited in studies which explore the social effect of tall poppies and their negative {{impact on the}} success of organisational culture change initiatives and organisational performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the impact of}} the New Public Management (NPM) {{paradigm}} on public sector reform in Thailand. The main objective of the thesis is to explore the question of whether Thai public sector reform belongs to the NPM paradigm, especially whether the intentions and contents of policy documents are actually realised in the implementation process. The study commences by reviewing the transformation of public administration to NPM and how this has affected developing countries. In theory, the traditional model of public administration, namely bureaucracy, has been considered as dysfunctional, no longer able to cope with changing circumstances and the new environment. NPM was introduced during the 1980 s and 1990 s in some rich countries in order to replace the traditional model of public administration. However, there are doubts about the appropriateness of NPM for the public sector in developing countries. The thesis is specifically concerned with Thailand and as a first step delineates the history of public administration and its reform in Thailand including current policies. This includes the introduction of NPM. The remainder of the thesis is comprised of a case study of one ministry in Thailand. Much of the data was collected from semi-structured interviews with officials in the ministry and government agencies responsible for reform. The case study focused on four dimensions of reform: <b>organisational</b> <b>restructure</b> and redesign of internal authority, public culture and values reform, workforce reduction, and internal NPM reform initiatives. The findings were mixed. Some NPM style initiatives such as restructuring of roles and functions were accomplished. However, some areas of NPM have either been partially implemented (downsizing) or not introduced at all (greater competition in public sector). It was also found that some reform initiatives, such as public culture and values reform, fell outside of the NPM paradigm. The research concluded that the NPM paradigm had made limited progress in the Thai public sector...|$|R
