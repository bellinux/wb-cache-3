5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session for the sole purpose <b>of</b> <b>considering</b> a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill {{by the end of the}} special session.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour <b>of</b> <b>considering</b> this group a single genus.|$|E

5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincoln’s inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention for the sole purpose <b>of</b> <b>considering</b> secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E
