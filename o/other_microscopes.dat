40|$|Introduction The light {{microscope}} remains a ubiquitous and irreplaceable research tool for modern biology. Unlike any <b>other</b> <b>microscope</b> it allows: (i) samples {{to be studied}} in vivo or in their native hydrated environments, (ii) highly specific labelling of multiple components, and (iii) detailed internal structures to be viewed in three dimensions. Its dominant weakness is its limited resolution, particularly in the axial, or focus, direction. Computational deconvolution (Agard et al., 1989) and confocal (Pawley, 1990) techniques have improved the resolution both laterally and, especially, axially, but still leave the axial resolution several times worse than the lateral. The wide popularity of these techniques {{over the last decade}} attests to the impact that resolution improvements in optical microscopy can have on biology. The resolving power of the optical microscope is fundamentally limited by the wavelength of light. As was understood by Ernst Abbe {{more than a century ago}} (Abbe,...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which energy {{filtered}} imaging allows quantitative matching of experimental and theoretical electron microscope images is investigated using two examples. In the first example, the matching of high resolution lattice images of (WO 3) 8 (Nb 2 O 5) 9, both energy filtered and unfiltered with a carbon surface layer, with corresponding simulations is considered. It is shown that in both cases even after all possible microscope and specimen parameters have been {{taken into account in}} the simulations, the contrast in lattice images obtained experimentally is only 1 / 3 of the contrast of corresponding simulated images. In the second example, energy filtered convergent beam patterns in a scanning transmission electron microscope are shown to depend sensitively on the microscope lens parameters and are used as a method of measuring defocus, spherical aberration and <b>other</b> <b>microscope</b> parameters.

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation is necessary so that genetic material is equally shared among daughter cells. However, maturing mammalian oocytes are particularly prone to {{chromosome segregation}} errors, making them {{a valuable tool}} for identifying the causes of mis-segregation. Factors such as aging, cohesion loss, DNA damage, and the roles of a plethora of kinetochore and cell cycle-related proteins are involved. To study chromosome segregation in oocytes in a live setting is an imaging challenge that requires advanced techniques. Here we describe a method for examining chromosomes in live oocytes in detail as they undergo maturation. Our method is based on tracking the "center of brightness" of fluorescently labeled chromosomes.

40|$|Scientists {{have long}} dreamt of an optical {{microscope}} {{that can be}} used to see a sample in nanometre resolution. Because light propagates through water and air, an optical microscope can be used to see, in vivo, the details of living matter and other materials in their unperturbed natural condition. In addition, an optical micro-scope provides colour images that contain much richer information than <b>other</b> <b>microscopes</b> in which only monochrome images are pro-duced. In particular, the visible and mid-infrared region of light cov-ers the energies corresponding to the electronic transitions in atoms and to molecular vibrations, allowing optical microscopes to provide information related to the intrinsic properties of the sample. But the resolution attainable with an optical microscope is limited to about 0. 5 μm because of the di"raction of light 1 – 3. #erefore, it becomes almost impossible to image a sample at the nanoscale through an optical microscope.

40|$|Sphaerotilus natans, one of {{the most}} widely {{reported}} causes of bulking in activated sludge, can exist both within and outside of a sheath. It can easily be confused with similar activated sludge bacteria and thus can be overlooked when present in low numbers. Fluorescent antiserum was successfully prepared against the nonfilamentous form and was shown to be highly specific, showing no reaction with either pure cultures of similar filamentous bacteria or entirely unrelated organisms. It did, however, show a lack of strain specificity since it reacted with S. natans isolates from the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States and with filamentous bacteria in South African activated sludges. Fluorescent antibody is capable of penetrating the filaments of S. natans to stain the cells individually. The use of fluorescent antiserum in the identification of S. natans filaments obscured by activated sludge flocs and other suspended matter was simple since the cells stained brightly and could be observed through the less dense matter, while the use of <b>other</b> <b>microscope</b> techniques would be hampered by these obstructions.

40|$|Reliable {{software}} {{is a prerequisite}} for successful operation of a modern wide field fluorescence microscope. When used for live cell imaging, acquisition speed is of particular interest. This is both because biological processes can be highly-dynamic, and to avoid unnecessary photobleaching and phototoxicity of living samples. This article shows that besides the hardware (microscope) components themselves, the acquisition control {{software is}} an important influencing factor of speed performance. We tested and compared the speed performance of five different generic applications (Image-Pro Plus, MetaMorph, Micro-Manager, SlideBook, and Volocity) using typical experimental setups involving a single specific state-of-the-art fluorescence microscope configuration. The test measurements included multichannel experiments, z-stacking, burst acquisition, as well as combinations of these measurements with time-lapse acquisitions. The measured data provided values for guiding the testing and analysis of <b>other</b> <b>microscope</b> systems with similar configurations. Despite the identical hardware settings, significant and surprisingly large speed differences were evident among the various software applications. Additionally, no application was identifiable as the fastest in all tests. Our work pinpoints the importance of the control software in determining a system`s ``real`` maximal imaging speed. The study could serve as basis for further tests, eventually influencing the system selection criteria for speed-sensitive applications. Microsc. Res. Tech., 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{manipulate}} material at the nanometer scale new methods and devices {{have to be}} developed. A nanomanipulator interface was designed and implemented into a commercial atomic force microscope (AFM) system. With {{the aid of a}} positioning joystick, direct positioning of the AFM probe with nanometer precision is possible. A commercial force feedback joystick serves as haptic interface and provides the user with real-time feeling of the tip-sample interactions. Due to the open design the manipulator interface can be used with <b>other</b> <b>microscopes</b> of the SPM family using tip-sample interactions like tunnelling current, interatomic magnetic force or electrostatic forces as haptic feedback signal. In addition, the nanomanipulator and a 337 nm nitrogen UV-laser microbeam for photoablation were combined on an inverted optical microscope. To test the nanomanipulator, human metaphase chromosomes were dissected using both techniques, photoablation and mechanical AFM manipulation. The experimental results show that by combining both methods biological material can be manipulated on different size scales in one integrated instrument. The effects of manipulation on human metaphase chromosome were studied in detail by atomic force microscopy. Sub- 400 -nm cuts were achieved by photonic ablation. Chromosomal fragments of a size less than of 500 nm could be isolated. By means of mechanical microdissection different cut size ranging from 80 nm to 500 nm can be easily obtained applying different load forces...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a newly built {{scanning}} single-electron transistor microscope {{in a highly}} vibration damped laboratory environment is presented. The main purpose of this setup is to obtain electrostatic potential distributions of surface near electron systems. Additionally, the microscope is sensitive to changes in capacitance, charge, contact potential, and temperature. One unique feature of this setup is the one-dimensional array of up to eight probing tips with a fixed spacing of 4 µm between them. Furthermore, the combination of its almost negligible influence on the sample while scanning over the surface, as well as its working temperature of less than 40 milli-Kelvin distinguishes it from the few <b>other</b> <b>microscopes</b> of its kind. At {{the beginning of the}} thesis the description of the microscope setup and functionality with an extensive characterization can be found. Moreover, electrostatic simulations based on the finite element method are presented to explain and understand measurement data obtained for the tip-sample approach and compensation. In the last sections the calibration technique used to measure Hall potential distributions is explained and the necessary set of measurements for the case of the integer filling factor four is shown. As a prospect for future measurements this microscope allows to obtain Hall potential distributions of samples under fractional quantum Hall conditions. In addition, the microscope is capable of intentionally disturbing the investigated electron system locally and simultaneously determining its response with the neighboring probing tips...|$|E

The work is carried out by using advanced microscopy (µXRM and XRF) based on synchrotron radiation and <b>other</b> <b>microscopes</b> (SEM and AFM), and also conventional molecular analysis (PCR and Sanger sequencing) and advanced spectroscopic measurements (UV-Raman). We conducted biochemical studies by using the advanced X-Ray microscopy and fluorescence (µXRM and XRF) techniques in order to reveal mechanisms of toxicity in human mesothelial (MeT 5 A) and placental cell lines (BeWo) exposed to carbon nanotubes (raw-SWCNT, purified- and highly purified-SCWCNT) or asbestos (crocidolite fibres). <b>Other</b> <b>microscopes</b> (AFM, atomic force microscopy and SEM, Scanning Electron Microscope) are added in some experiments, to better investigate the morphology and the cell-nanofiber interactions. The results obtained with the combination of microscopic techniques allowed to reveal similar as well as different toxic mechanisms in the two internal barriers. The cells treated with raw-SWCNT and crocidolite fibres compared to the control showed an severe alteration of iron metabolism, which is maximal in the pleural cells and is clearly related to the presence of iron into the fibre. X-ray microscopy images (absorption and phase contrast imaging) confirm that the toxicity of nanomaterials is characterized by membrane damage with vesicle secretion and filipodia formation. In relation to this toxic mechanism quite complex and still unknown we evaluated the presence of intracellular ferritin in treated cells. The results demonstrated that crocidolite and “raw” carbon nanotubes increase the amount of intracellular ferritin in both cell models, while purified and highly purified carbon nanotubes give values comparable to control. The stimulation is clearly lower in placental cells, clearly linked to a different or lower uptake of fibres in these cells, suggesting that this barrier is less vulnerable than the pleura. We also investigated the genetic effects and genetic predisposition to toxicity of nanomaterials (nanotoxicogenomic). Since we have to learn from asbestos, one study investigates the possible genetic predisposition to develop mesothelioma after asbestos exposure by looking for BAP 1 gene mutations in 30 cases of mesothdelioma. Sanger sequencing of BAP 1 gene in the 30 patients identified one non-synonymous variant and two intronic variants. While Sanger sequencing of cDNA revealed no alternative splicing due to the nucleotide change for each mutations. In silico mutation analysis was performed in a predicted protein structure of BAP 1 protein without any significant possible effect of the amino acid change about exonic mutations of patient 9. Finally, MLPA (Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) analysis revealed no significant copy number variations at exonic level in all samples. The last aim of molecular studies was to test the feasibility of UV-Raman (IUVS beamline, Elettra Synchrotron of Trieste) spectroscopy to reveal epigenetic changes at DNA level after nanomaterial exposure. An oxidative environment has been created in vitro by using carbon nanotubes (raw-SWCNT), which contain some impurity in metal traces (iron), and free radicals OH• (derived from H 2 O 2). In this condition the nucleotides (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) result in increased susceptibility to oxidative damage.
