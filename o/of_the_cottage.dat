5|$|Professor Sir Richard Owen, {{the first}} Director of the Natural History Museum, lived at Sheen Cottage {{until his death}} in 1892. The cottage was {{destroyed}} by enemy action in 1944. The remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> can be seen in patches and irregularities in the wall 220 metres from Sheen Gate.|$|E
5|$|The caretaker's cottage is two storeys high, {{built of}} {{limestone}} ashlar with a slate roof. It has sash windows {{to the south}} and north, with false windows on the east and west ends. Access to the pool is through the ground floor lobby <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b> Inside, the original panelled ceiling remains intact as well as a hob and fireplace in the bedroom and another early 19th-century fireplace on the ground floor. On either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> are six changing cubicles with sloping roofs covered with asbestos sheets. At the western end are two further dressing rooms and the perpetual shower which was linked to the ladies' pool.|$|E
5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} clad in {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting is located {{to the north}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> building. It was probably constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
50|$|Formerly one of Gotland's biggest fishing villages, Gnisvärd {{is made up}} {{of about}} 40 cottages of {{limestone}} or wood, which line both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrow road running parallel to <b>the</b> beach. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> were built during the 20th century. At <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> are enclosed areas for drying fishing nets.|$|R
50|$|Dean Collard was {{appointed}} Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cottages</b> in August 1987.|$|R
50|$|Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> survive today: <b>the</b> Green <b>Cottage,</b> <b>the</b> Jefferson <b>Cottage,</b> <b>the</b> Blue <b>Cottage</b> and <b>the</b> Macdonald <b>Cottage.</b> <b>The</b> fifth, called <b>the</b> Teapot <b>Cottage,</b> was {{destroyed}} by the owners in 1982.|$|R
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> School.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage,</b> which was demolished in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> are now presented as the Coleridge family might have known them, with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his inkstand, locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E
50|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> {{have been}} rebuilt by Humber College for their purposes.|$|R

25|$|The {{aerial photo}} taken {{in about the}} 1940s {{provides}} a good view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages.</b> <b>The</b> modern streetscape {{is more difficult to}} see because of trees. Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings in the foreground (except for Wyalla) have since been demolished and now form part of St Aloysius' College.|$|R
5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E

25|$|Earlier that morning, two {{fishermen}} {{had seen}} the submerged car {{in the water and}} notified the residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> nearest to the scene, who called the authorities at about 8:20a.m.|$|E
50|$|A {{resident}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages,</b> Martha Padve, {{was highly}} {{involved in a}} long-running case to list Crystal Cove on the National Register and to fight <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> California over tenancy matters.|$|R
5|$|The mansion {{house is}} not {{open to the public}} but walks can be taken through <b>the</b> estate. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> are hired out as holiday lets, {{including}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lodge houses.|$|R
50|$|Also {{built with}} the {{lighthouse}} was a sandstone keeper's cottage, also designed by Dawson. A second cottage {{was constructed in}} 1860, and two rooms were added to each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> in 1877. <b>The</b> <b>cottages</b> were connected to the city water only in 1897, using stored waters until then.|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge over}} the Craufurdland Water at Craufurdland was built by Mr. Craufurdland, using the balusters from the {{original}} part of the battlements of Cessnock Castle, which had originally been given to Captain Whyte <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cottage.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{flagpole}} {{was erected}} {{in the front}} yard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> before its official opening in April 1916. It was donated by Mrs Helmes, in memory of her nephew killed at Anzac. A plaque was attached to the flagpole, commemorating Private Leslie Arthur Wilkinson, who died at Anzac Cove.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> was {{a notable}} public event. The delivery procession was watched by thousands, and {{met at the}} building site by a crowd of hundreds. The main construction attracted a crowd of 4,000 onlookers, the local streets were decorated with flags and streamers, and the Police Band provided music. A souvenir booklet was printed to mark the occasion, with descriptions of the events and the cottage, photographs, {{and the names of}} many of those involved.|$|E
50|$|Brick and flintstone {{were later}} {{used to build}} or rebuild some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> and public buildings, such as town halls. Some villages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pays de Caux and the pays de Bray were entirely rebuilt this way.|$|R
25|$|South <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> is <b>the</b> grave <b>of</b> Fanny Byrn, wife of George Byrne who was {{the head}} light keeper from February 1886 until July 1900. It is {{surrounded}} by a picket fence and marked with a marble headstone.|$|R
2500|$|Renewed {{publication}} <b>of</b> O'Brien's newspaper <b>The</b> Irish People (1905–1909) exalting <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> building, its editorials equally countermanding the IPPs' [...] "Dublin bosses" [...] {{attempts to}} curtail the program, fearing settled rural communities {{would no longer be}} dependent on Party and Church. Munster took full advantage, erecting most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages,</b> additional funding following under Birrell's [...]|$|R
25|$|Mrs Baxter (Lally Bowers) – The {{old lady}} who rented a cottage on Joe Maplin's land {{next to the}} camp. Maplin wanted her to move out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> so he could {{demolish}} {{it in order to}} build more chalets. He offered her a new modern bungalow and £300 to persuade her to move (Ted tried to steal £250 of it), but she refused. Maplin then planned to demolish the cottage while Mrs Baxter was out shopping, but the plan was thwarted by the entertainment staff.|$|E
25|$|The {{originally}} drawn boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> Home Historic District, {{still the}} current {{boundaries of the}} National Register district, are {{much smaller than the}} state and locally designated boundaries. Comprising the 700 block of Dorman Street, 1102 to 1130 East St. Clair Street and 802 and 806 North Highland Avenue, 23 properties are included in the National Register district. Anchored by the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store, these boundaries also include the Vonnegut & Bohn doubles and sixteen other houses. This area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1990.|$|E
25|$|Jarman is also {{remembered for}} his famous shingle cottage-garden, {{created in the}} latter years of his life, {{in the shadow of}} Dungeness nuclear power station. The cottage is built in vernacular style in timber, with tar-based weatherproofing, like others nearby. Raised wooden text on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> is the first stanza and the last five lines of the last stanza of John Donne's poem, The Sun Rising. The cottage garden was made by {{arranging}} flotsam washed up nearby, interspersed with endemic salt-loving beach plants, both set against the bright shingle. The garden {{has been the subject of}} several books. At this time, Jarman also began painting again (see the book: Evil Queen: The Last Paintings, 1994).|$|E
25|$|In 1831 {{there was}} a hopyard north of Sound Hall, which had a malt kiln. Two beerhouse keepers were {{recorded}} in Sound in 1850, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> adjacent to Sound Hall {{is believed to have}} been an alehouse.|$|R
500|$|The {{interior}} features many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage's</b> original details including mantels, woodwork and built-in cabinets. [...] There is an arched opening {{between the}} former dining and living rooms. [...] A large room, which features the same design and materials {{as the original}} portion and is located at <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, {{is believed to be}} a later addition to <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> {{were now}} burning, {{obscuring}} <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> fire and driving <b>the</b> defenders out <b>of</b> their positions. Hearing <b>the</b> din <b>of</b> battle in Blenheim, Tallard {{sent a message}} to Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.|$|R
25|$|Across the country, Victoria Day {{serves as}} the {{unofficial}} marker {{of the end of}} the winter social season, and thus the beginning of the summer social calendar. Banff, Alberta's Sunshine Village ends its lengthy ski season on Victoria Day and, likewise, it is during this long weekend that many summer businesses—such as parks, outdoor restaurants, bicycle rentals, city tour operators, etc.—will open. Victoria Day is also a mark of the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> season, when cottage owners may reverse the winterization of their property. Gardeners in Canada will similarly regard Victoria Day as the beginning of spring, as it falls at a time when one can be fairly certain that frost will not return until the next autumn. There is also a change in fashion: lighter-coloured summer clothing was traditionally worn from Victoria Day through until Labour Day.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of urban decay in the 1960s and '70s, common to inner city neighborhoods in Indianapolis, Cottage Home has since stemmed the loss of {{historic}} buildings and is now home to a flourishing and diverse community. Key to the area's improvement was the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> Home Neighborhood Association (CHNA) in 1984, whose efforts halted the razing of residential properties by local businesses, and {{a renewed interest in}} restoring the area's homes. The Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store are the most architecturally significant buildings in the district, anchoring the district's addition to the National Register in 1990. Cottage Home was further expanded to its largest bounds at the state level in 1995 and local designation of the Ruskaup-Ratcliffe house and store followed. In 2008, the state bounds, encompassing 320 parcels and 292 properties, were designated as a Conservation District by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{continued}} to experience strong growth through the 1960s and 70s, but {{the population of}} Cottage Home and other inner-city neighborhoods was reduced by migration to the suburbs {{in the process of}} urban sprawl. As Cottage Home was within the flood zone of Pogue's Run, residents began to leave for other areas. In addition, I-70/I-65's construction required demolishing homes {{on the west side of}} the neighborhood, leaving it bordered with a high-traffic roadway. By the 1980s, more than 100 houses had been demolished in Cottage Home. A renewed interest in historic restoration and the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> Home Neighborhood Association (CHNA) in 1984 reversed the demolition trend; the area has since lost only six homes to fire or demolition. CHNA led the effort for the unique neighborhood to be designated as a historic district, achieving addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, the State Register in 1995, and city designation in 2008. Today, while infill has been slow, the neighborhood continues as a vibrant and active community.|$|E
50|$|Denby Bottles is a {{settlement}} in Derbyshire, England. It {{is located on the}} B6179 road in Denby. Denby Bottles Methodist Church is in Danesby Crescent. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> have a segment of garden which is across the road and the brook.|$|R
50|$|Also {{worth noting}} are Manor House and Brook House (both about 1800) and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> in Old Town Street {{surviving}} {{from the old}} village. Dawlish's transformation from a fishing settlement to a watering hole for Victorian celebrities is documented at the Dawlish Museum.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} other fires and severe weather in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century also damaged many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> and <b>the</b> camp's property. Thereafter, a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damaged {{structures}} were rebuilt, but some were left as empty lots or allowed {{to fall into}} disrepair.|$|R
