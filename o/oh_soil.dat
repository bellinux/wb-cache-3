40|$|Geological and {{geotechnical}} investigations involving detailed geologic mapping and composite {{soil sample}} laboratory tests respectively, {{have been carried}} out at Ganawuri, North Central Nigeria with a view to delineating the different rock units in the area and their Engineering significance. The area is underlain by the Crystalline Basement rocks composed of Granite Gneiss with late Diorite, Basalts and Pegmatite intrusions. The older units have been intruded by the Biotite Granite of the Younger Granite province, occurring as a ridge bordering the northeastern margin of the area. Structures observed in the area include fault/shear zones, pegmatite dykes, basaltic dykes and fractures. The dominant trend is in the NE-SW direction with local deviations in NNE-SSW, WNW-ESE, NW-SE and NNW–SSE. The joints are generally vertical with few dipping steeply to the SE or SW. Thus it is evident that the early NNW-SSE trending foliation in the granite gneiss guided the regional structural development in the area. This feature thus controlled all the other structures (anticline, shear zones, fractures and the river channel), all of which are oriented in the same direction. This dominant NE-SW trend may be associated with development of the Benue Valley of Nigeria. Composite soil samples were obtained at different points around the area and laboratory analysis carried out on them.

The granular nature [a well graded sand (SW) soil], mineralogy, reactivity, and residual lime content of the SSF media make it well suited for blending with DM high-plasticity organic (<b>OH)</b> <b>soil,</b> so that geotechnical and environmental soil improvement occur simultaneously with one amendment. The source materials (100 % DM, 100 % SSF) were evaluated along with [Math Processing Error], [Math Processing Error], [Math Processing Error], [Math Processing Error], and [Math Processing Error] DM-SSF blends (dry weight basis), where the DM content is reported first. Key findings include that the 100 % DM had a [Math Processing Error] of 27. 3 °, which increased to a peak [Math Processing Error] value of 45 ° for the [Math Processing Error] DM-SSF blend. The hydraulic conductivity ([Math Processing Error]) of the 100 % DM ([Math Processing Error]) remained relatively constant until SSF content reached 80 %, where an abrupt increase to [Math Processing Error] was observed. The field demonstration project confirmed that the DM-SSF blends could be easily blended to within [Math Processing Error] of their target DM content. Trial highway embankments were constructed with 100 % DM, 100 % SSF, and the [Math Processing Error], [Math Processing Error], and [Math Processing Error] DM-SSF blends to modified Proctor compaction goals ranging from 85 to 95 % relative compaction on the maximum dry unit weight, depending on the blend. The average cone penetration test (CPT) tip resistance for 100 % DM and 100 % SSF media were approximately 1. 3 and 57. 3 MPa, respectively. The compacted [Math Processing Error], [Math Processing Error], and [Math Processing Error] DM-SSF blend embankments were generally characterized by average CPT tip resistances on the order of 2. 9, 6. 2, and 11. 6 MPa, respectively.

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} {{of different}} soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions {{is needed to}} understand their relative importance in the global C cycle. Among the chemical methods of SOC fractionation, oxidative degradation is considered more promising because {{of its ability to}} mimic the natural microbial oxidative processes in soil. This study focuses on detailed understanding of changes in structural chemistry and isotopic signatures of SOC upon different oxidative treatments for assessing the ability of these chemicals to selectively isolate a refractory fraction of SOC. Replicated sampling (to ~ 1 m depth) of pedons classified as Typic Fragiudalf was conducted under four land uses (woodlot, grassland, no-till and conventional-till continuous corn [Zea mays L. ]) at Wooster, <b>OH.</b> <b>Soil</b> samples (< 2 mm) were treated with three oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), disodium peroxodisulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 8) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)). Oxidation resistant residues and the bulk soil from A 1 /Ap 1 horizons of each land use were further analyzed by solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and accelerator mass spectrometry to determine structural chemistry and 14 C activity, respectively. Results indicated that, oxidation with NaOCl removed significantly less SOC compared to Na 2 S 2 O 8 and H 2 O 2. The NMR spectra revealed that NaOCl oxidation preferentially removed lignin-derived compounds at 56 ppm and at 110 - 160 ppm. On the other hand, the SOC resistant to Na 2 S 2 O 8 and H 2 O 2 oxidation were enriched with alkyl C groups, which dominate in recalcitrant macromolecules. This finding was corroborated by the 14 C activity of residual material, which ranged from - 542 to - 259 ‰ for Na 2 S 2 O 8 resistant SOC and - 475 to - 182 ‰ for H 2 O 2 resistant SOC as compared to relatively greater 14 C activity of NaOCl resistant residues (- 47 to 61 ‰). Additionally, H 2 O 2 treatment on soils after light fraction removal was more effective in isolating the oldest (14 C activity of - 725 to - 469 ‰) SOC fraction. The Δ 14 C signature of SOC removed by different oxidizing agents, calculated by mass balance, was more or less similar irrespective of the difference in labile SOC removal efficiency. This suggests that SOC isolated by many fractionation methods is still a mixture of much younger and older material and therefore {{it is very important that}} the labile SOC should be completely removed before measuring the turnover time of stable and refractory pools of SOC. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on the protection of soil organic C from decomposition suggests that soil texture affects soil C stocks. However, different pools of soil organic matter (SOM) might be differently related to soil texture. Our objective was to examine how soil texture differentially alters the distribution of organic C within physically and chemically defined pools of unprotected and protected SOM. We collected samples from two soil texture gradients where other variables influencing soil organic C content were held constant. One texture gradient (16 - 60 % clay) was located near Stewart Valley, Saskatchewan, Canada and the other (25 - 50 % clay) near Cygnet, <b>OH.</b> <b>Soils</b> were physically fractionated into coarse- and fine-particulate organic matter (POM), silt- and clay-sized particles within microaggregates, and easily dispersed silt-and clay-sized particles outside of microaggregates. Whole-soil organic C concentration {{was positively related to}} silt plus clay content at both sites. We found no relationship between soil texture and unprotected C (coarse- and fine-POM C). Biochemically protected C (nonhydrolyzable C) increased with increasing clay content in whole-soil samples, but the proportion of nonhydrolyzable C within silt- and clay-sized fractions was unchanged. As the amount of silt or clay increased, the amount of C stabilized within easily dispersed and microaggregate-associated silt or clay fractions decreased. Our results suggest that for a given level of C inputs, the relationship between mineral surface area and soil organic matter varies with soil texture for physically and biochemically protected C fractions. Because soil texture acts directly and indirectly on various protection mechanisms, {{it may not be a}} universal predictor of whole-soil C content...|$|R

The influence of soil cationic exchange capacity on the strength of the stabilized soil are investigated by means of measuring the concentrations of main ions in the pore solutions squeezed from the stabilized soil specimens and the strength of the stabilized soil. It is revealed that: cationic exchange of the soil samples depresses the Ca(OH) 2 saturation of the stabilized soil. When the cationic exchange capacity of the soil samples is high enough, the Ca(OH) 2 concentration of the pore solution in the stabilized soil cannot get saturated, under these conditions, further cationic exchange depletes Ca 2 +, OH- which shall be used to generate calcium silicate hydrate, so the amount of calcium silicate hydrate decreases, which results in the poor strength of the stabilized soil...|$|R

However, the contribution of <b>soil</b> NH 2 <b>OH</b> to <b>soil</b> N 2 O emission rates in natural ecosystems is unclear. Here, we determined the spatial variability of NH 2 OH content and potential N 2 O emission rates of organic (Oh) and mineral (Ah) soil layers of a Norway spruce forest, using a recently developed analytical method for the determination of <b>soil</b> NH 2 <b>OH</b> content, combined with a geostatistical Kriging approach. Potential soil N 2 O emission rates were determined by laboratory incubations under oxic conditions, followed by gas chromatographic analysis and complemented by ancillary measurements of soil characteristics.

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to establish global mass balances for polychlorinated {{dioxins and furans}} (PCDD/Fs) {{have focused on the}} terrestrial sink, thereby neglecting deposition to the oceans and atmospheric losses. In this study, the atmospheric sink of polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) was calculated {{on the basis of their}} presence in <b>soils.</b> <b>OH</b> radical ([OH]) depletion reactions compete with atmospheric deposition fluxes for the fate of atmospheric PCDD/Fs. Three different steady state scenarios were considered: scenario A was a one-box atmosphere with globally averaged [OH], temperature (T), atmospheric lifetime (tlife), and a constant gas-particle partitioning (Φ); in scenario B, [OH], T, and Φ were averaged in a multibox atmosphere, with a constant tlife; and in scenario C, tlife was varied. In scenario A the strength of the atmospheric sink was 2400 – 2800 kg/yr; in scenario B it was ∼ 2100 kg/yr; in scenario C, it was ∼ 1, 800 kg/yr (tlife = 5. 4 days) to ∼ 2, 800 kg/yr (tlife = 14 days). The majority of the atmospheric sink was due to the depletion of Cl 4 DFs (1300 – 1400 kg/yr), followed by Cl 4 DDs (360 – 380 kg/yr) and Cl 5 DFs (230 – 240 kg/yr). On a global scale, major sinks for PCDD/Fs are the deposition to terrestrial soils and the oceans. For Cl 6 – 8 DDs, deposition to soils outweighs depletion reactions in the atmosphere and ocean uptake. The more volatile Cl 4 – 5 DD/Fs, however, are true “multimedia” compounds, with their estimated atmospheric sink being roughly as important as the terrestrial sink (in the case of Cl 5 DD/Fs) or outweighing it (e. g., Cl 4 DD/Fs) ...|$|R
40|$|Litter {{decomposition}} on {{the forest}} floor is an essential process in soil nutrient cycles and formation. These processes are controlled by abiotic factors such as climate and chemical Litter quality, and by biotic factors such as microbial community diversity and activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the importance of litter depth with respect to (i) chemical titter quality as evaluated by solid-state C- 13 NMR, (ii) enzyme activities, and (iii) microbial functional diversity in four different titter layers (OLn, OLv, OF, and <b>OH).</b> A Mediterranean <b>soil</b> profile under an evergreen oak (Quercus ilex L.) forest was used as a model. The recalcitrant OM fraction, corresponding to the deepest layer, showed tow enzyme activities. Peroxidases and fluorescein diacetate hydrolases (FDA) were more active in the OLn layer and probably originated largely from plants. High cellulase activity in the OLn and the OLv layers, which are rich in polysaccharides, corresponded with the high content of O-alkyl carbon compounds. Following polysaccharide degradation, laccases and lipases were much more evident in the intermediate layers. This spatial variation in nutrient demand reflected a preferential degradation of the specific plant polymers. Phosphatases were more active along the three upper layers and probably reflected a P limitation during litter degradation. Alkatine/acid (AcPAlP/AcP) ratio increased in the deepest layer, suggesting an increased participation of bacteria AlP in phosphatase pools. Results of Biolog (TM) also indicated spatial variations in microbial functionality. Indeed, FF plates showed the highest functional diversity in the uppermost layer, while ECO plate functional diversity was highest in the intermediate layers. Finally, our results indicated that microbial activity and functional diversity of micro-organisms change with titter depth on a very small scale and vary with chemical organic matter (OM) composition. Thus, the observed increases in the biological variables studied were determined by the evolution of OM chemical structures, the nature and availability in C nutrients, and they ultimately resulted in a progressive accumulation of recalcitrant compounds...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the recent}} {{evolution}} of methane {{emissions in the}} Arctic is necessary to interpret the global methane cycle. Emissions are affected by significant uncertainties and are sensitive to climate change, leading to potential feedbacks. A polar version of the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model is used to simulate the evolution of tropospheric methane in the Arctic during 2012, including all known regional anthropogenic and natural sources, in particular freshwater emissions which are often overlooked in methane modelling. CHIMERE simulations are compared to atmospheric continuous observations at six measurement sites in the Arctic region. In winter, the Arctic is dominated by anthropogenic emissions; emissions from continental seepages and oceans, including from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, can contribute significantly in more limited areas. In summer, emissions from wetland and freshwater sources dominate across the whole region. The model is able to reproduce the seasonality and synoptic variations of methane measured at the different sites. We find that all methane sources significantly affect the measurements at all stations {{at least at the}} synoptic scale, except for biomass burning. In particular, freshwater systems play a decisive part in summer, representing on average between 11 and 26  % of the simulated Arctic methane signal at the sites. This indicates the relevance of continuous observations to gain a mechanistic understanding of Arctic methane sources. Sensitivity tests reveal that the choice of the land-surface model used to prescribe wetland emissions can be critical in correctly representing methane mixing ratios. The closest agreement with the observations is reached when using the two wetland models which have emissions peaking in August–September, while all others reach their maximum in June–July. Such phasing provides an interesting constraint on wetland models which still have large uncertainties at present. Also testing different freshwater emission inventories leads to large differences in modelled methane. Attempts to include methane sinks (<b>OH</b> oxidation and <b>soil</b> uptake) reduced the model bias relative to observed atmospheric methane. The study illustrates how multiple sources, having different spatiotemporal dynamics and magnitudes, jointly influence the overall Arctic methane budget, and highlights ways towards further improved assessments...|$|R
40|$|N 2 O is an {{important}} greenhouse gas and today’s single most ozone depleting substance. Soils {{have been identified as}} the major source of N 2 O. Microbial processes nitrification and denitrification are considered the major N 2 O sources. However, N 2 O production in soils, especially during nitrification, is far from being completely understood. N 2 O release during both processes has been described by Firestone and Davidson (1989) in their conceptual ‘hole-in-the-pipe’ model. The model attributes N 2 O emissions from soils during nitrification and denitrification to leaks in the N transformation from ammonium to nitrate and the incomplete stepwise reduction of nitrate to N 2. Until now, the mechanisms behind this ‘leaky’ N 2 O emission during nitrification have not been explained so it is unknown what drives these emissions. Several abiotic reactions involving nitrification intermediate hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) have been identified leading to N 2 O emissions, but are neglected in most current studies. It is known that NH 2 OH can be oxidized by several soil constituents to form N 2 O (Bremner 1997). For better mitigation strategies it is mandatory to understand the underlying processes of N 2 O production during nitrification and their controlling factors. We studied N 2 O emissions from different soils in laboratory incubations. Soils used covered a wide range of land use types from cropland to grassland and forest. Soil incubations were conducted at conditions favorable for nitrification. Soil samples were placed into vials, deionized water or NH 2 OH solution was added, respectively, and water content was adjusted to the desired level. Vials were closed immediately for incubation. Experiments were conducted with non-sterile and sterile (autoclaved) soils. After 6 hours of incubation time the vials were sampled for N 2 O mixing ratios. Additionally, CO 2 mixing ratios were analyzed to quantify microbial activity. For quantification of both gases a gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer, USA) was used. To get insight into the dynamics of N 2 O formation, soil samples were placed in flow-through chambers, NH 2 OH solution was added, and chambers were flushed continuously with pressurized air. N 2 O production was quantified, at a temporal resolution of 1 Hz, using quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (Aerodyne Research, USA). Furthermore, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Isoprime, UK) was used to analyze the isotopic signature of the produced N 2 O (i. e. δ 15 N, δ 18 O, and 15 N site preference). We observed large differences in N 2 O emissions between different soils upon NH 2 OH addition. While a forest soil showed hardly any reaction to the addition of NH 2 OH, a very high and immediate formation of N 2 O was observed in a cropland soil. N 2 O production after NH 2 OH addition was also observed in autoclaved samples confirming an abiotic production. CO 2 data additionally suggested an abiotic N 2 O production, as CO 2 production was not enhanced by NH 2 OH addition to live soils. Laser spectrometry measurements revealed very fast reaction kinetics. An agricultural soil showed a turnover of about 50 % in less than one hour. This proved that the fast reaction rate is also valid in soils. Further, isotopic signatures of N 2 O were used to identify underlying processes. The site preference of 15 N in N 2 O is believed to be a powerful tool to disentangle different N 2 O production and consumption processes. We observed site preferences of about 33 – 36 ‰ in N 2 O emissions caused by NH 2 OH addition. This was in the same range as results found by Heil et al. (2014) for abiotic NH 2 OH oxidation as well as by Sutka et al. (2003) for nitrification. To find a dependence on soil properties, we correlated N 2 O emission rates after NH 2 <b>OH</b> addition with <b>soil</b> chemical properties. We found three primarily controlling factors of NH 2 OH induced N 2 O production in the following order: soil pH, C/N ratio, and Mn content. The combination of those could explain up to 90 % of the variability of the N 2 O emissions caused by NH 2 <b>OH</b> addition. <b>Soil</b> pH showed the strongest correlation with N 2 O emission rates. This is explained by the higher stability of NH 2 OH (pKs 5. 8) at lower pH due to increasing protonation. C/N ratio had a strongly negative correlation with N 2 O emission rates. Finally, Mn could oxidize free NH 2 OH to N 2 O. Although it was shown that NH 2 OH can also react with Fe 3 + to form N 2 O (Bremner 1997), we could not find a correlation between Fe in soils and N 2 O emission rates. This {{can be explained by the}} higher redox potential of the MnO 2 /Mn 2 + redox pair compared to the Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + redox pair. Our results suggest a coupled biotic–abiotic production of N 2 O during nitrification. We showed that some soils have a very high potential to oxidize NH 2 OH so that abiotic N 2 O emissions in those soils seem only to be limited by NH 2 OH availability. We hypothesize that N 2 O production is the result of a leakage of the nitrification intermediate NH 2 OH, which acts as the substrate for abiotic oxidation to N 2 O in the soil matrix. N 2 O emissions during nitrification could then be explained as a function of nitrification rate and the combination of soil properties as mentioned above. However, further research is necessary to consolidate this relationship. Bremner JM 1997. Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst 49, 7 - 16 Firestone MK and Davidson EA 1989.

In a second step, N 2 O emission rates were determined by means of aerobic laboratory incubations of 3 g soil in 22 -mL vials. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of soil HA concentrations and N 2 O emission rates in the Oh and Ah layers of the whole sampling area were analyzed using a geostatistical approach. The correlations among soil HA, N 2 O emission rate, pH, soil C, N, Fe, Mn and soil water content (SWC) were further explored. The HA concentrations ranged from 0. 3 – 37. 0 μg N kg- 1 and 0. 02 – 11. 4 μg N kg- 1 dry <b>soil</b> in the <b>Oh</b> and the Ah layer, respectively. The spatial distribution of HA was similar in both layers, with substantial spatial variability dependent on soil type, tree density and distance to a stream, e. g., HA concentration was greater at locations with a thick litter layer or at locations close to the stream. N 2 O emission rates showed a similar pattern as soil HA concentrations, with higher rates in the Oh layer than in the Ah layer. N 2 O emission rate exhibited the highest correlation with soil HA content in the <b>Oh</b> layer, while <b>soil</b> NO 3 - content explained N 2 O emissions best in the Ah layer, associated with SWC, Mn and C content. HA concentration was negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with SWC in the Oh layer, while positively correlated with C and N as well as NO 3 - content in the Ah layer. Moreover, Mn content {{was the most important}} factor for HA recovery at the specific extraction conditions. The results demonstrated that HA is a crucial component for aerobic N 2 O formation and emission in spruce forest soils. Mn may also play a key role to the aerobic N 2 O emission due to the chemical reaction with HA. Further studies should focus to the relationships between HA, Mn and aerobic N 2 O emission in other ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an {{important}} anthropogenic greenhouse gas and today’s single most ozone depleting substance. Soils {{have been identified as}} the major source of N 2 O. Microbial nitrification and denitrification are considered the major N 2 O emission sources. However, N 2 O production in soils, especially during nitrification, is far from being completely understood. Several abiotic reactions involving the nitrification intermediate hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) have been identified leading to N 2 O emissions, but are being neglected in most current studies. However, it is known that NH 2 OH can be oxidized by several soil constituents to form N 2 O. For better mitigation strategies it is mandatory to understand the underlying processes of N 2 O production during nitrification and their controlling factors. We studied N 2 O emissions from different soils in laboratory incubation experiments. Soils covered a wide range of land use types from arable to grassland and forest. Soil incubations were conducted with and without the addition of NH 2 OH at conditions favorable for nitrification with non-sterile as well as with sterile samples. N 2 O and, additionally, CO 2 evolution were analyzed using gas chromatography. To get insight into the dynamics of N 2 O formation, N 2 O production from NH 2 OH was quantified online using quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, isotope ratio mass spectrometry was used to analyze the isotopic signature of the produced N 2 O (i. e. δ 15 N, δ 18 O, and 15 N site preference). We observed large differences in N 2 O emissions between different soils upon the addition of NH 2 OH. While a forest soil sample with pH < 3 showed hardly any reaction to the addition of NH 2 OH, a very high and immediate formation of N 2 O was observed in a cropland soil sample at neutral pH. N 2 O production after NH 2 OH addition was also observed in autoclaved samples, which confirmed an abiotic production mechanism. Further, isotopic signatures of N 2 O could be used to differentiate between production processes. We correlated the N 2 O emission rates after NH 2 <b>OH</b> addition with <b>soil</b> chemical properties. We found three primarily controlling factors of the NH 2 OH induced N 2 O production in the following order: soil pH, C/N ratio, and Mn content. The combination of these three soil properties could explain up to 90 % of the variability of the N 2 O emissions caused by NH 2 OH addition. Although it was shown in the past that NH 2 OH can react with Fe(III) to form N 2 O, we could not find any correlation between Fe concentration in soils and N 2 O emission rates. Our results suggest a coupled biotic–abiotic production of N 2 O during nitrification. We hypothesize that N 2 O production {{is the result of a}} leakage of the nitrification intermediate NH 2 OH. N 2 O emissions during nitrification could then be explained as a function of nitrification rate and a combination of soil properties. However, further research is necessary to consolidate this relationship...|$|R
40|$|EGU General Assembly 2015, held 12 - 17 April, 2015 in Vienna, Austria. id. 1200 The {{replacement}} of native beech forests (Fagus sylvatica) by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) afforestation may exert changes in soil properties, particularly in {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) (Carceller and Vallejo, 1996). Stable isotopic signatures of light elements (d 13 C, d 15 N) in soils and plants are valuable proxies for the identification of biogeochemical processes and their rates in the pedosphere (Andreeva et al., 2013 and refs therein). In this work the C and N stable isotopic analysis {{is used as a}} proxy to detect changes in SOM surrogated to the effect of centennial {{replacement of}} beech by the Scots pinewood. Two acid soil profiles, developed on quartzites under a humid climate at an altitude of 1400 - 1500 masl, have been sampled in Moncayo (Iberian range, NE-Spain). For each soil profile three O-layers (litter: OL, fragmented litter OF and humified litter <b>OH)</b> and mineral <b>soil</b> horizons (Ah, E, Bhs and C) were sampled. Content and bulk isotopic signature of light elements (C and N) were analysed in a Flash 2000 elemental micro-analyser coupled via a ConFlo IV interface to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Isotopic ratios are reported as parts per thousand deviations from appropriate standards. The standard deviations of d 13 C and d 15 N were typically less than 0. 05 per thousand, 0. 2 per thousand, respectively. After 100 years since the pine afforestation, no differences on C content were observed in the O-layers, ranging from 30 - 47 % in pine soils and 37 - 47 % in beech soils. Similarly, no differences on N content were observed in the O-layers, ranging from 1. 24 - 1. 86 % in pine soils and 1. 70 - 1. 71 % in beech soils. C and N contents decrease progressively in depth with the exception of E-horizons where the lowest C and N content values were found. C/N ratio is higher in pine soil (20. 7 - 38. 1) than in beech O soil horizons (21. 8 - 27. 5), showing similar behavior with soil depth. Pine biomass was slightly enriched in 13 C as compared to that from beech (OL enrichment factor= 1. 24 0. 13 per thousand). Along the soil profile the C isotopic signature (d 13 C) reflects the main vegetation signature being higher in pine than beech in the organic soil horizons (OL, OF and OH) down to the first mineral Ah horizon. At deeper horizons d 13 C value tends to equal that of the original beech soil indicating a limited influence of the afforested specie with depth even 100 years after afforestation. A consistent enrichment in d 15 N with depth was observed in the two profiles. This N enrichments have been related with progressive N losses being particularly pronounced in forest soils (Szpak, 2014 and refs therein). This phenomenon can be also related to migrations of N forms in a more evolved organic matter. In this view N losses in organic layers under beech seem to be less pronounced that under the alien pine.
