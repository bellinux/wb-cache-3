5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> Arkham City.|$|E
5|$|Now a centre {{for arms}} manufacture, the castle was made more secure, {{with a new}} {{defensive}} ditch, freshly repaired walls and a new chapel. The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of Richard Marshal against Henry III in 1233–4, suggesting it had considerable military value at this time. Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the £20 fee each year being paid to the constable of the castle by 1287, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> the much larger castles of Rhuddlan or Nottingham.|$|E

5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> the very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E

Generally, the world seems to be in a mostly pre-industrial agrarian state.|$|R
5|$|Having been governed and {{developed}} by the British South Africa Company since the 1890s, Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing colony within the British Empire in 1923, when it was granted responsible government by Whitehall. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, was henceforth empowered to run its own affairs in almost all matters, including defence. Foreign affairs {{was one of the}} few areas reserved by the British government. As the Empire's lone self-governing colony, Southern Rhodesia was considered a sui generis case, almost <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> a dominion. Starting in 1932, Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those from the dominions, a unique situation which continued after Imperial Conferences were superseded by Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1912 Lasker {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} {{for a world}} title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament record for the previous few years had been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> Lasker's and {{a little ahead of}} Capablanca's. The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.|$|E

Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium.

5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England {{extension}} program was to provide opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed to external degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external students {{would be the same}} as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E
5|$|This {{demand was}} {{far-reaching}} and required {{transformation of the}} empire into a federal state, placing Lithuania <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian constitutional system. Heated discussions continued on the means to achieve this transformation. Some argued for armed resistance, but were reminded that the previous uprisings in November 1831 and January 1863 had failed. Others suggested peaceful and passive resistance: refusing to pay taxes, boycotting products from monopolistic companies (mostly those selling alcoholic beverages), not allowing children to attend Russian schools, evading drafts into the Russian army, and organizing factory worker strikes. The delegates, who were mostly small farmers, also discussed land reform, demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it. However, no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage the peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening {{in other parts of}} the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{historically}} {{included many}} units from what are now separate Commonwealth realms. When the English Empire {{was established in}} North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early Seventeenth Century there was no standing English Army, only the Militia, and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial Militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against Indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial Militias fought side-by-side with it {{in a number of}} wars, including the Seven Years War. Some of the colonial Militias rebelled during the American War of Independence. Militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and Native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the American War of 1812. With the growth of the Empire around the world, Non-European (ie., non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and protectorates, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The West India Regiments were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally-raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army Lists, unlike units such as King's African Rifles. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, et cet.) mostly achieved Commonwealth Dominion status before or after the First World War and were granted granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>par</b> <b>with</b> the British Government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the Australian Army), although Canada retained the term Militia for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these Dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming Commonwealth realms (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).|$|E
