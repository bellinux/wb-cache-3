The Paganism Reader provides a definitive collection of key sources in Paganism, ranging from its ancient origins to its twentieth-century reconstruction and revival. Chronologically organized sections include extracts from ancient Greek, Norse and Celtic literature, inspirational texts from the early <b>twentieth-century,</b> <b>writings</b> by leaders <b>of</b> the Pagan revival, and newer perspectives showing the diversity of Paganism today.
