5|$|This {{still left}} the {{question}} of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing with the League, and though the U.S. refused to participate in any meeting with political implications, it sent observers to sessions on technical and humanitarian matters.|$|E
5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Tillman as {{governor}} initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting {{the ills of}} Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In {{about half of the}} lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> rape a white woman, though studies have shown that lynchings were tied to economic and social issues. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.|$|E

25|$|In Flanders, the {{situation}} was very stable, with the limited local publication possibilities all taken by the established authors of the 1940s and 1950s, leaving no room for new talents after the disappearance of most magazines.

25|$|The law {{provides}} 120 days of paid {{maternity leave}} {{to women and}} seven days to men. The law also prohibits employers from requiring applicants or employees to take pregnancy tests or present sterilization certificates, but some employers sought sterilization certificates from female job applicants <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> avoid hiring women of childbearing age. Violations of the law are punishable by jail terms for employers of up to two years, while the company may be fined 10 times the salary of its highest-paid employee.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Cold War in the late 1940s Big Diomede became a Russian military base and all its native residents were removed to mainland Russia. When people from Little Diomede went too close to the Russian side <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> visit their relatives on the neighboring island during World War II, they were taken captive. According to one of the survivors, Oscar Ahkinga, after 52 days of internment and interrogation, the Iñupiat were banished and told not to come back.|$|E

The following day the regiment lost one of its best-known members, Gunner Frederick 'Paddy' Mills, a pre-war professional footballer for Leeds United, who dismounted from a vehicle while it was halted in a taped route through a minefield. It was unclear whether he stepped on a mine <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> retrieve a booby-trapped box, but he was killed instantly.|$|E
25|$|The {{kingdom of}} Khotan {{was one of}} the many small states found in the Tarim Basin that {{included}} Yarkand, Loulan (Shanshan), Turfan, Kashgar, Karashahr, and Kucha (the last three together with Khotan made up the four Garrisons during the Tang dynasty). To the west were Central Asian kingdoms of Sogdiana and Bactria. It was surrounded by powerful neighbours, such as the Kushan Empire, China, Tibet, and for a time the Xiongnu, all of which had exerted <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> exert their influence over Khotan at various times.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to prevent}} worker born larvae is that other workers or the queen may attempt to sting or push the ovipositing, egg laying, workers off of the cells. It is {{important}} to note that workers almost never acted aggressively towards the queen <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> prevent her from laying eggs. This results in nearly all eggs that mature being queen produced. Even after the original queen in a colony dies and the new queens leave, workers may lay eggs but these eggs usually starve, rarely reaching maturity.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on 11 August, Rau's family officially {{reported}} her as {{a missing}} person to the New South Wales Police. The police launched a public appeal, advertising in newspapers and placing posters nearby. On 12 August, NSW police contacted DIMIA, to search their records for information about Rau. The search revealed nothing, {{and there was no}} further interstate cooperation. The police contacted DIMIA again six weeks later, on 24 September, in an attempt to discover whether Rau had left <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> leave Australia. DIMIA replied that she had not left, and was still in the country.|$|E
25|$|As the war progressed, {{factions of}} other tribes joined, <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> join Black Hawk. Other Native Americans and {{settlers}} carried out {{acts of violence}} for personal reasons amidst {{the chaos of the}} war. In one example, a band of hostile Ho-Chunk intent on joining Black Hawk's Band attacked and killed the party of Felix St. Vrain in what Americans knew as the St. Vrain massacre. This act was an exception as most Ho-Chunk sided with the U.S. during the Black Hawk War. The warriors who attacked St. Vrain's party had acted independently of the Ho-Chunk nation. From April to August, Potawatomi warriors also joined with Black Hawk's Band.|$|E
25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled credenza. It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to,</b> at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E

25|$|About 3:00 p.m, the mobs {{broke into}} the police headquarters. The major in charge, Benicio Arce Vera, came out unarmed to plead with the crowd, and gave orders to his men not to shoot. The mob trampled him and seized weapons and ammunition. According to Arce, in an {{interview}} years later to Bohemia magazine, among those who took the weapons was Fidel Castro, (La Habana, April 21, 1983, issue 16). Some writers say that this event influenced Fidel Castro {{at the age of}} 21, who had the opportunity to witness the initial violence and take views about the viability of an electoral route for political change. Others view it more darkly since Castro at that age had already been involved in violence in Cuba where he is reputed to have killed, <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> kill, some university rivals (including Rolando Masferrer) by that time (Ros, 2003).|$|E
25|$|Rumors also {{circulated}} that Hinrichs {{intended to}} detonate his homemade bomb inside the stadium; these included {{allegations that he}} tried to enter the stadium that evening but was denied entry after he refused to be searched. Hinrichs was not a student football season ticket holder; {{there was no evidence that}} Hinrichs tried to enter the stadium, and Hinrichs apparently neither bought nor tried to buy a game ticket. Agents scoured hundreds of hours of security camera tapes and found no images of Hinrichs, but, since not all entrances had cameras, they conceded they may never know if Hinrichs wanted to enter <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> enter the stadium that night. Boren noted that Hinrichs waited until the game was underway and pre-game fans and students had cleared the South Oval; there would have been injuries or deaths to bystanders had Hinrichs detonated his device in the same area prior to or after the game.|$|E
25|$|Delattre {{deployed}} his men {{on a ridge}} covering both Collioure and Port-Vendres. Cuesta formed {{his troops}} into columns under Castrillo, Ortig and Solano and attacked. All three columns broke through, the French defenders fleeing {{in the direction of}} their coastal forts. As the retreating French approached Fort Saint-Elme and Port-Vendres, both places shut their gates, refusing to admit the soldiers. Fort Saint-Elme even fired on them. Feeling betrayed, large numbers of men surrendered to the pursuing Spanish troops. Saint-Elme's traitorous commander immediately surrendered the fort as soon as Solano summoned it. Ortig called for the surrender of Port-Vendres and it also capitulated. The remaining French troops sought refuge in Collioure <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> break out by fighting their way north along the coast. Delattre escaped but Fabre was killed, dying bravely at the front of one of the columns. Cuesta sent three battalions to approach Collioure at night with torches, threatening to burn the place. It surrendered as well. The date of the battle is unclear. Two sources stated that the engagement happened on 20 December. Another authority asserted that the fighting occurred on the 21st. A final source put the date of Collioure's surrender as 23 December.|$|E

25|$|Already in the 19th century Catholic Germans of Polish {{ethnicity}} and the German state clashed {{in a struggle}} for the unadulterated Roman Catholic faith in events like the Kulturkampf of the 19th century. In those regions of Germany with a considerable population of Polish ethnicity Catholic Church mobilised Polish resistance during the Prussian partitions of Poland {{and served as a}} stronghold of Polish identity. Due to this Nazis targeted it in the newlly annexed territories. In the General Government the attitude of Nazis was different as it was to serve as temporary work camp and reservation for Poles and they wanted Church's religion to serve as tool to control Poles (this also meant extermination and terror against priests as well opposing Nazi plans) existence. The Nazi fight against Polish parts of Catholic Church was also a problem for the Catholic Church in Germany, where many priests supported nationalist claims during the war and were faced with a split of the Church itself as Polish Catholics were persecuted. Overall the German hierarchy silently accepted (and in some cases supported or encouraged) the discrimination and treatment of Poles as Untermenschen, with notable individual exceptions who either protested <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> help their fellow church members of non-German ethnicity.|$|E
