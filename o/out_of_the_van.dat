5|$|Kirk moves <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Houten {{house and}} manages {{to keep a}} cheery {{attitude}} until he is fired from {{his job at the}} cracker factory. Luann quickly readjusts to single life with Milhouse and starts a new relationship with an American Gladiator. While at Moe's, Kirk mentions that he never saw the divorce coming and regrets not being more sensitive to Luann's needs. Homer cheers Kirk up by telling him that his marriage to Marge is solid, but Homer soon begins to fear that his marriage may end in divorce. Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage, but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge. He recalls his wedding reception, which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop. Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge, but they only serve to annoy her.|$|E
5|$|Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her {{paraplegic}} brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), {{travel with}} three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), {{to visit the}} grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who talks about his family {{who worked at the}} old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E

My companion, who was restless all the time, glanced at him frequently, or I should scarcely have noticed his existence. In dress and appearance he resembled very much the ordinary valet in private service, except for his eye-glasses, and that his face lacked <b>the</b> smooth pastiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class. For some reason or other my companion seemed to take a dislike to him.|$|R

Can you step <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> {{for a few minutes and}} we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E

Around 11:20 p.m. on July 28, 1990, he drove to the house and found that Teresa was not home so he waited in the driveway. When she returned from work, he blocked her access with his van. After getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> he went over to the car where, through an open window, he stabbed Teresa 28 times with a screwdriver, with their 10-year-old son, John, in the passenger seat. John tried to stop his father but was unable.|$|E
2500|$|Four police {{officers}} gave chase to Rigg, who was handcuffed and restrained in a prone, face down position as officers leant {{on him for}} eight minutes. Arrested for assaulting a police officer, public disorder and theft of a passport—which was actually his own—he was then placed face-down with his legs bent behind him in the caged rear section of a police van and transported to Brixton police station. During the journey [...] "his {{mental and physical health}} deteriorated" [...] and he was [...] "extremely unwell and not fully conscious" [...] when eventually taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> This followed a delay of ten minutes during which he was left handcuffed in a 'rear stack' position, unattended and unmonitored while the van sat outside the station in the car parking area.

He saw a helper with a bag of food for Marcel Buysse, and after he convinced the helper that Buysse was already <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, <b>Van</b> Lerberghe took <b>the</b> food. Later, he had to stop because a train had stopped at a crossing. Van Lerberghe did not wait for the train to leave, but entered the train with his bicycle and left at the other side.

[...] Police Chief Wayne Tucker described the killing as [...] "unusual" [...] because it occurred downtown and in broad daylight.|$|E
2500|$|About {{one week}} after the game was taken away from Daniel, on October 20, 2007, he used his father’s key to unlock the safe and take it back, also taking his father’s handgun. Court reports stated that Daniel came up behind his parents as they were {{relaxing}} on their couch {{in the living room and}} said “Would you close your eyes, I have a surprise for you.” Daniel then proceeded to shoot both of his parents. His father said that “his head went numb and he saw blood pouring down from his skull.” [...] Daniel shot his mother in the head, arms, and chest, killing her. In court his father testified that after Daniel shot both of his parents, he tried to make the event look like a murder-suicide by placing the gun in his father's hand whilst saying to him “Hey dad, here’s your gun. Take it,”. A few minutes later, his sister and her husband, Heidi and Andrew Archer, came over for their prior plans of watching a baseball game together. Daniel lied to them that they should not come in because their parents had been fighting. Then, they heard groaning and pushed their way through to find the aftermath of the shooting. Heidi called the police, and before they got there Daniel made an escape attempt by driving off in the family’s van with the Halo 3 game in the passenger seat. The police caught up with him and forced him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> via road block. While police were handcuffing him, he yelled [...] "My Dad shot my Mom!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The IRA unit {{arrived in}} Loughgall from the {{northeast}} shortly after 7PM. All were armed and wearing bulletproof vests, boilersuits, gloves and balaclavas. The digger drove past the police station, turned and drove back again with the Toyota van doing the same, ostensibly to check if the coast was clear. Members of the unit felt that something was amiss, and debated whether to continue, but {{decided to go ahead}} with the attack. Tony Gormley and Gerard O'Callaghan got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> and joined Declan Arthurs on the digger, according to journalist Peter Taylor, [...] "literally riding shotgun", with weapons in one hand and a lighter in the other. At about 7:15, Declan Arthurs drove the digger towards the base. In the front bucket was 200–400 lb of semtex inside an oil drum, partially hidden by rubble and wired to two 40-second fuses. The other five members of the unit followed in the van with Eugene Kelly driving, unit commander Patrick Kelly in the passenger seat whilst in the rear were Jim Lynagh, Pádraig McKearney, and Seamus Donnelly. [...] The digger crashed through the fence and the fuses were lit. The van stopped a short distance ahead and—according to the British security forces—three of the team jumped out and fired on the building. Author Raymond Murray, however, disputes this. [...] According to Taylor, Patrick Kelly jumped from the passenger seat and, followed by others, immediately opened fire on the base either to encourage the rest of the unit, to resolve dispute about going ahead with the operation, or possibly because this was the way previous attacks had begun. At the same time, the bomb detonated, destroying the digger along with much of the building, and injuring three members of the security forces.|$|E

Through the summer he spent much time walking and talking with his recently widowed cousin, Kee Vos-Stricker. She was <b>the</b> daughter <b>of</b> his mother's older sister and Johannes Stricker, who had shown warmth towards the artist. [...] Although Van Gogh {{would have liked to}} marry Stricker, given her decisive refusal: [...] "No, never, never" [...] (niet, nooit, nimmer) and his inability to support himself financially, marriage was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question. <b>Van</b> Gogh was hurt deeply.

2500|$|At around 3.40 p.m., {{they crossed}} the Northern Ireland border at Border Check Point 10 on the Edenappa Road. It was a dark, {{overcast}} wintry day. Yards up ahead, {{at the top of}} a hill on a tree-lined section of the road just south of Jonesborough, armed members of the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade waited to carry out the ambush. The site the IRA chose was in [...] "dead ground", meaning that they could not be seen by the nearby British Army observation post. The secluded back road was considered to be one of the most dangerous in south Armagh and as such, a [...] "no-go area" [...] for the security forces as it was regularly patrolled by the local IRA. According to the Cory Collusion Inquiry Report, as Buchanan reached the hilltop he was flagged down by an armed IRA man standing in the middle of the road wearing Army battle fatigues and camouflage paint on his face. Another armed man, dressed likewise, stood in a ditch by the roadside by four cars he ordered to stop and their drivers to position so only one car could pass the road at a time and slowly at that. Buchanan, because of the location and dress of the two armed men would have had difficulty in ascertaining if it was an ambush or a British Army checkpoint, slowed down and stopped. At that moment, a stolen cream-coloured Litace van, which had been following behind his car, overtook and pulled into the laneway of an empty house opposite. Four more armed IRA men wearing battle fatigues and balaclavas leapt <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> They approached the Cavalier and immediately began shooting, mainly at the driver's side, hitting the two officers. Buchanan made two frantic attempts to reverse and escape but his car stalled on each attempt and he was likely already dead before his car came to a rest. Examination of the car the following day found it still to be in reverse gear with Buchanan's foot fully pressed against the accelerator. Breen, despite his gunshot wounds, managed to stumble out of the car, waving a white handkerchief at the gunmen in an apparent gesture of surrender. According to eyewitnesses, one of the gunmen walked over to him, told him to lie on the ground and fired a shot into the back of his head, killing him instantly. Another gunman then approached Buchanan's already dead body in the car and shot him again in the side of the head at point-blank range.|$|E
