5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in only a small number <b>of</b> <b>instances,</b> but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In {{mapping the}} {{distribution}} of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with Glamorgan, with two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>instances</b> falling within that county. The custom stretched east into the industrial valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly account coming from Monmouth itself; this account {{is also one of}} the earliest. A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a single record of the custom being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing the custom with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded examples from Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been present in those areas.|$|E
30|$|In the design, {{the type}} <b>of</b> <b>instance</b> and the variant of metaheuristic has two and four levels, respectively. In all there are 2 × 4 = 8 groups. The {{version of the}} two-way ANOVA used is the one {{with more than one}} {{observation}} per cell, but the number of observations in each cell is equal. In our case, each group had six observations making it a total of 46 cells. This version is useful for determining if the type <b>of</b> <b>instance</b> and the variant of metaheuristic are independent of each other (or if there is interaction); they are independent if the effect <b>of</b> <b>instance</b> size on percent deviation (and standard deviation, success rate, execution time) remains the same, irrespective of whether the variant of metaheuristic used is taken into consideration. Additionally, if there is interaction, then a follow-up analysis is done to determine whether there are any “simple mains effect” and what these effects are. Simple mains effect for our problem involves determining the mean difference in percent deviation/standard deviation/success rate/execution time between the type <b>of</b> <b>instance</b> for each variant of the metaheuristic, as well as between variants of the metaheuristic for each type <b>of</b> <b>instance.</b>|$|R

Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E

Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E

Subsequently, we address vehicle routing prob- lems and we show how the reoptimization approach can be used to obtain good approximate solution in an efficient way for some of these problems...|$|R
