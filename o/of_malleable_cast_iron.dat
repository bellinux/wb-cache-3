50|$|Malleable iron {{starts as}} a white iron casting that is then heat treated {{for a day or}} two at about 950 C and then cooled over a day or two. As a result, the carbon in iron carbide {{transforms}} into graphite and ferrite plus carbon (austenite). The slow process allows the surface tension to form the graphite into spheroidal particles rather than flakes. Due to their lower aspect ratio, the spheroids are relatively short and far from one another, and have a lower cross section vis-a-vis a propagating crack or phonon. They also have blunt boundaries, as opposed to flakes, which alleviates the stress concentration problems found in grey cast iron. In general, the properties <b>of</b> <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> are more like those of mild steel. There is a limit to how large a part can be cast in malleable iron, as it is made from white cast iron.|$|E

5000|$|Steel {{contains}} {{a relatively small}} percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the gamma iron. When austenized steel is exposed to air {{for long periods of}} time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> in a process called [...] "white tempering." [...] This tendency to decarburize is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.|$|R

The appropriate generating system of oil mist is constructed and the specified turning tool with oil hole is used. In order to verify the cooling effect of MQL, the tool temperature at the flank face is measured using a newly assembled fiber-coupled two-color pyrometer. In this new technique, a sensing fiber is inserted into a small hole that extends to the outer surface of the tubelike workpiece and it rotates with the workpiece. The thermal radiation accepted by a sensing fiber is noncontactly transmitted to the other fixed fiber {{and led to the}} two-color detectors. As for cutting force in turning of SCM 440 H, MQL is more effective in low cutting speed below 100 m/min. The tool temperature in MQL turning is approximately 100 °C lower than that in dry turning over the wide range of 30 ∼ 300 m/min.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{a method for}} the fatigue life {{estimation}} of components from materials which fail with only little deformation under multiaxial stochastic loading with different grades of correlation was determined and verified by tests. Two different materials of nodular iron (GGG 40 and GGG 60) as well as <b>malleable</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> (GTS 45) were available. The multiaxial stochastic loading resulted from the superposition of tensile and torsional loading. Two extreme cases for the grade of correlation of both loads, the linear correlated and the uncorrelated loading were taken into account. For the failure in each case nominal strains in the most highly loaded cross-section are decisive. The characteristic quantities for the fatigue life estimation under linear correlated loading {{are based on the}} nominal strain hypothesis, for the uncorrelated loading the method of reference strain was introduced. The reference strain is not only a value related to the material behaviour, but takes also account for the statistical interaction of the uncorrelated loads based on the independance of casual values. Test and calculation correspondingly show for the uncorrelated loaded components a higher fatigue life by about factor of 2 compared to the results with linear correlated loaded samples if the same particular characteristic values of loading (peak values of spectra) boundary conditions (shape of spectra and stress ratio) are chosen.
