40|$|Listeners {{are usually}} {{considered}} recipients in conversational interaction, whose main activity {{is to take}} in messages from other speakers. In this view, the listening activity is separate from speaking. Another view is that listeners and speakers are equal co-participants in conversations who construct the talk together. In support of this latter view, one finds a group of vocalisations which are quintessentially listener talk - little conversational objects such as uh-huh, <b>oh,</b> mm, <b>yeah,</b> right and mm-hm. These utterances do not have meanings in a conventional dictionary sense, but are nevertheless loaded with complex and subtle information about the stance listeners take to what they are hearing, information that is gleaned not only from their phonetic form, but also from their complex prosodic shape and their placement and timing within the flow of talk. This book summarises eight of these objects, and explores one, mm, in depth. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of natural, spoken communication, {{in contrast to}} our conscious images of the written language, include unmanaged speaking processes such as repetitions, false starts and incomplete sentences, which we most likely were not conscious of when speaking. In the flow of speaking we primarily focus on {{the implications of the}} meanings that we are trying to express and, to a lesser degree, are conscious of our choice of words but rarely focus on grammatical constructions or pronunciation as a native speaker. The flow of words seem often!to lack coherence of ideas or purposes and are punctuated with a variety of feeling expressions (huh, really, <b>oh</b> no, <b>yeah,</b> gosh, come on) as well as words which seem to mark boundaries in the flow of speech (anyway, well, uh, um, you know). Yet conversations generally achieve their purposes as we feel we could communicate the meanings that we intended. There are, of course, times when conversations fail to adequately communicate our purposes and we come away feeling dissatisfied or later thinking we could have said something better. But {{the fact of the matter}} is that for most social interaction we do accomplish our conversational goals.

Roxanne Blanford of AllMusic rated the album 3.5 out of five and wrote, [...] "these young women learned well the lessons of predecessors Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and the current reigning queen of angst-rock, Courtney Love".

Another commentary for Se7en was included on the Criterion Collection laserdisc, which included cast member Gwyneth Paltrow, but this track has not been released on DVD. Smith's DVD for Clerks II features three audio commentaries, all featuring Smith, and he is known for bringing his stars, including Ben Affleck and Jason Lee onto his commentary tracks. Smith has recorded audio commentaries for all of his films except Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and also appeared on the Road House audio commentary after mentioning it on the 10th Anniversary DVD of Clerks. Smith has also appeared on the special edition Donnie Darko DVD, doing commentary with Richard Kelly. Fincher has recorded a track for all of his films except Alien 3, which he disowned after controversy over the production. Directors Terry Gilliam, Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola, David Cronenberg, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Soderbergh are also highly respected as intelligent and informative commentators, often working with Criterion to create commentaries for their films.

5000|$|The song's {{opening line}} [...] "Imagine I'm {{in love with}} you" [...] was innovative, drawing the {{listener}} immediately into the story. McCartney would cite this as an early example of Lewis Carroll's influence on Lennon's lyrics — a ploy explored again in later compositions such as [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] and Lennon's solo [...] "Imagine". Reiterating its A-side's catchphrase ("Yeah"), and assuming the heavy scouse accents conspicuous in their early records, Lennon and McCartney [...] "drawl {{their way through a}} mock-naïve love lyric". McCartney later singled out the chord change underneath [...] "It's not like me to pretend" [...] (moving from a D major to A minor), crediting the Joan Baez rendition of the folk song [...] "All My Trials" [...] as inspiration. [...] "I also liked that slightly faggy way we sang: 'Oh <b>yeah,</b> <b>oh</b> yeah', which was very distinctive, very Beatley." [...] Looking back in 1967, Lennon said: [...] "Ever heard anyone from Liverpool singing 'yes'? It’s yeah!".|$|R

I had the idea of just this guy, a fat little monster sits there very relaxed and says, [...] "Oh <b>yeah,</b> <b>oh</b> yeah". So I told him, 'Why don't you try just to sing on and on 'oh yeah'?... Dieter was very angry when I told him this and he said, 'are you crazy, all the time [...] "Oh yeah"? Are you crazy?! I can't do this, no no, come on, come on.' And then he said, 'some lyrics, like [...] "the moon... beautiful", is this too much?!' and I said, 'no, it's OK', and then he did this 'oh yeah' and at the end he thought, 'yeah it's nice', he loved it himself also.

[...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E

The Guardian critic Gareth McLean was critical of the episode, writing: [...] "Now here's an idea for another Holby spin-off - one set in the hospital's STD clinic. Of course, given the ceaseless intra-departmental shagging {{that goes on in}} that hospital, there might be too much crossover with existing shows, with not a look-in for characters who aren't actually on staff. Here, sexist surgeon Clifford returns to complicate Maddy's life, though since she's been sleeping with Sam, who's slept with Connie, Chrissie and Faye, she appears to need no help in that area.She's going to die."

40|$|What are backchannels? Backchannels can be {{generally}} {{defined as the}} intermittent vocal noises e. g. mm, <b>oh,</b> right, <b>yeah,</b> made by the listener while in conversation with another person. They are known {{by a variety of}} other names, reflecting the different linguistic and other theoretical paradigms in which they have been investigated. One such alternative name is response token, used in conversation analysis (Gardner 2001, McCarthy 2002), where they are treated as potential or actual turns in the construction of dialogue, but this tends to the overshadow the other kinds of feedback that backchannels may provide. In the following paper we adopt the more inclusive term backchannels for vocal noises uttered from the back channel in counterpoint to the speech of the turn-holder in the main channel. The term backchannel makes no assumptions about their role in discourse, and serves as a neutral basis for the investigation of backchannel functions reported below. The term itself will be abbreviated to BC(s) {{in the body of the}} text following. The prototypical BCs discussed in previous research are simple monosyllabic or monomorphemic forms, like those already illustrated. They may be more or less lexical in their content: compare mm with right. BCs may be conjoined in pairs or clusters, e. g. oh yes, as noted by Tottie (1991) and Clancy et al. (1996); they may also be reduplicated, e. g. yeah, yeah. Apart from those structural possibilities yielding simple or complex/compound BCs, any BC may be uttered as a single piece of feedback to the turn-holder’s talk, or as one of a set in a string, in counterpoint to a longer turn. Compare the BCs produced by the listeners ($B) in examples (1) and (2) below, where they are marked up according to the ICE corpus annotation system (see further Section 15. 3 below). The BCs are numbered to indicate the locations where they coincide with the speaker’s talk, i. e. not as follow-up responses to it. They are thus “turn-internal” in their use, in Kjellmer’s (2009 : 88) terms. 22 page(s...|$|R
