5|$|The {{building}} of St James' Church {{was commissioned by}} Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819, designed by the convict architect Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour. Governor Macquarie and Commissioner John Bigge laid the foundation stone on Thursday, 7 October 1819. The building was originally intended {{to serve as a}} courthouse as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> location of St Andrew's Cathedral but they were put on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a Royal Commission into the colonial government. Bigge initially approved of the courthouse project but by February 1820, less than four months after his arrival, he strongly recommended its conversion into a church.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} 19th century stadia called Hampden Park, built on {{different}} sites. A stadium <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> site was first opened on 31 October 1903. Hampden {{was the biggest}} stadium in the world when it was opened, with a capacity in excess of 100,000. This was increased further between 1927 and 1937, reaching a peak of 150,000. The record attendance of 149,415, for a Scotland v England match in 1937, is the European record for an international football match. Tighter safety regulations meant that the capacity was reduced to 81,000 in 1977. The stadium has been fully renovated since then, with the most recent work being completed in 1999.|$|E

5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly {{grounded in the}} tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> and the splintering of personal identity. The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E
5|$|Because Stretford is {{situated}} on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach; the Angel Hotel, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day site {{of what used to}} be the Bass Drum public house, was one of the main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s, about the time that horse-drawn omnibuses arrived, in 1845. The Manchester Carriage Company's tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10minutes between 8:00am and 10:15pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the main}} road {{southeast}} from Klamath Falls, still unimproved in California, headed southeast to State Highway Route 28 (now SR 299) at Canby rather than south to Bieber. There travelers could head east on Route 28 to Alturas and south <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> US 395 (not a state highway north of Susanville until 1933) towards Reno. The California state legislature passed a law in 1939, providing for state takeover of the Canby-Oregon road if the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Public Roads were to construct and pave it. The road was in fact mostly paved by mid-1939, and under construction or completed by mid-1940, when Oregon Route 58 opened, continuing the corridor northwest from Klamath Falls. In 1943 the legislature gave it the Route 210 designation; Oregon had added the short connecting Hatfield Highway to its state highway system in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Construction of an {{extension}} to Route 115 (Santa Clara Street, now SR 130) at 30th Street in San Jose began in 1939, and {{was completed by}} late 1940. As with the portion between Fourth and 13th Streets, it was not marked as a numbered route. The state legislature authorized {{an extension}} beyond San Jose back to El Camino Real near Ford Road in 1947, which was already under construction, and was completed that year. This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a median barrier. Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; only the two ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over Coyote Road, though with no access, {{just south of the}} Coyote Creek bridge. The original 1947 bridge over Coyote Road remains, though widened in 1990, {{and is one of the}} oldest road-road grade separations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> freeway.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn {{does not}} claim a {{specific}} foundation date; {{there is a}} tradition {{that none of the}} Inns of Court claims to be any older than the others. Law clerks and their apprentices have been established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> site since at least 1370, with records dating from 1381. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Inn grew steadily with great prestige, reaching its pinnacle during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Inn was home to many important barristers and politicians, most notably Francis Bacon, and counted Elizabeth herself as a patron. Thanks to the efforts of prominent members such as William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, Gray's Inn became the largest of the four by number, with over 200 barristers recorded as members. During this period, the Inn became noted for the masques and revels that it threw, and William Shakespeare is believed to have first performed the Comedy of Errors play there.|$|E

40|$|ISBN: 978 - 3 - 9810801 - 5 - 5 International audienceFault {{injection}} {{has become}} a very classical method to determine the dependability of an integrated system with respect to soft errors. Due to the huge number of possible error configurations in complex circuits, a random selection of a subset of potential errors is usual in practical experiments. The main limitation of such a selection is the confidence in the outcomes that is never quantified in the articles. This paper proposes an approach to quantify both <b>the</b> error <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> results and <b>the</b> confidence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> interval. <b>The</b> computation of the required number of faults to inject {{in order to achieve}} a given confidence and error interval is also discussed.

5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> {{site was}} constructed in the late 13th or early 14th century, at {{around the same time}} as the friary, which was founded in about 1296. Its hilltop location is unusual for the area; most nearby churches are built on mounds near water. The new church was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors, and the living was first recorded as being in the gift of Sir John de Cockfield, passing to his Bacon descendants before its acquisition by the Abbot and Convent of Langley in 1375. The abbey controlled more than 60 Norfolk parishes, and the living of Blakeney was within its gift for the next sixty years, ending with the dissolution of the abbey in 1435. The patronage seems then to have passed to the Earl of Sussex, but quickly transferred to John Calthorpe, a descendant of the original founder, John Cockfield, and it remained with his family until 1922. Sir Alfred Jodrell then acquired the patronage, bequeathing it to Keble College, Oxford on his death in 1956. Since 1989, the benefice has been in the gift of Keble College, and the Bishop of Norwich.|$|E
