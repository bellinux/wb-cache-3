5|$|Academy Award-winning costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell {{heard about the}} script and contacted King, who in turn hired her. Powell was granted exclusive access to Victoria's wedding dress and coronation robes while researching. Based upon his work on The Lives <b>of</b> <b>Others</b> <b>and</b> his German nationality, Hagen Bogdanski {{was selected as the}} director of photography. Fellowes enlisted his friend Alastair Bruce's help with the coronation ceremony's historical authenticity, which led to Bruce's employment as the film's historical consultant, his first film credit.|$|E
5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} objectionable or taboo words or phrases) {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, {{but it is not}} required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. Echolalia (repeating the words <b>of</b> <b>others)</b> <b>and</b> palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Betty Sanders met MalcolmX {{after one}} of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was {{regularly}} attending his lectures. In 1956 she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to BettyX. One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> MalcolmX {{made a point of}} inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries.|$|E
5|$|A young {{traveling}} Romani {{girl who}} Edward saves from being {{sold to the}} Thule Society. On the surface, she is proud of her heritage and lifestyle, but is unable to bear being discriminated for it. She {{has the ability to}} read the minds <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> becomes fascinated with Edward's world after witnessing his memories of it. Believing she wouldn't be discriminated in Edward's world, Noah assists the Thule Society in opening the Gate based on information from Edward's memories, but relents once Edward points out that his home is no utopia, and leaves Munich together with the Elric brothers. She is also similar in appearance to Rose, a character from the original anime.|$|E

5|$|Acarya Ananda Jha, {{the author}} of the Chinnamasta Tattva, prescribes her worship by {{soldiers}} as she embodies self-control of lust, heroic self-sacrifice for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> fearlessness in the face of death. In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Botanists in the 20th century {{recognised}} B.oblongifolia as {{a species}} in its own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia {{as it was the}} oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he concluded that it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> is hence not a validly published name—the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B.paludosa, B.integrifolia or even B.marginata.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, {{the park}} became the {{location}} for George Frederic Watts's Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, {{a memorial to}} ordinary people who died while saving the lives <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> who might otherwise be forgotten, {{in the form of}} a loggia and long wall housing ceramic memorial tablets. Only four of the planned 120 memorial tablets were in place at the time of its opening, with a further nine tablets added during Watts's lifetime. Watts's wife, Mary Watts, took over the management of the project after Watts's death in 1904 and oversaw the installation of a further 35 memorial tablets in the following four years along with a small monument to Watts. Later she became disillusioned with the new tile manufacturer and, with her time and money increasingly occupied by the running of the Watts Gallery, she lost interest in the project, and only five further tablets were added during her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

5|$|Norcross was afforded {{a privileged}} {{education}} {{that was not}} available to many young ladies of her generation. At 16 years of age, she graduated from Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The nature of her essays {{provide insight into the}} woman she would become: one who would successfully operate in a male-oriented society, had an interest in bettering the plight <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> appreciated historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Frederick, {{the heir to}} the British throne on 20 March 1751, caused {{constitutional}} chaos; George II wished to appoint his favourite son Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, as Regent (since the heir apparent, George III, was only a child), while the public favoured the child's mother Princess Augusta. In an attempt to reach a compromise the government introduced a bill to Parliament declaring that Augusta was to be a regent along with a council <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> that George would become the heir when he reached maturity. Murray made a speech supporting the government's proposal, but despite this, Parliament was not convinced that a council was necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

5|$|The new {{treaties}} gave minorities {{the right}} to appeal directly to the League or UN General Assembly. In {{the case of the}} Mandates and the UN Partition Plan for Palestine compromissory clauses provide for the International Court's jurisdiction. The victorious powers attempted to ensure the stable development of the region between defeated Germany and Soviet Russia, a region characterized by the existence of many ethnic groups and the emergence of new nations. The idea behind the Minority Treaties was that by subjecting those countries to the scrutiny <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>and</b> to the threat of sanction and intervention from the newly created international body, the League of Nations, the rights of minorities would be safeguarded.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{suggested}} a plan where the encomienda would be abolished and Indians would be congregated into self-governing townships to become tribute-paying vassals of the King. He still {{suggested that the}} loss of Indian labor for the colonists could be replaced by allowing importation of African slaves. Another important part of the plan was to introduce a new kind of sustainable colonization, and Las Casas advocated supporting the migration of Spanish peasants to the Indies where they would introduce small-scale farming and agriculture, a kind of colonization that didn't rely on resource depletion and Indian labor. Las Casas worked to recruit a large number of peasants who would want to travel to the Islands, where they would be given lands to farm, cash advances, and the tools and resources they needed to establish themselves there. The recruitment drive was difficult, and during the process the power relation shifted at court when Chancellor Sauvage, Las Casas's main supporter, unexpectedly died. In the end a much smaller number of peasant families were sent than originally planned, and they were supplied with insufficient provisions and no support secured for their arrival. Those who survived the journey were ill-received, and had to work hard even to survive in the hostile colonies. Las Casas was devastated by the tragic result of his peasant migration scheme, which he felt had been thwarted by his enemies. He decided instead to undertake a personal venture which would not rely on the support <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>and</b> fought to win a land grant on the American mainland which was in its earliest stage of colonization.|$|E
