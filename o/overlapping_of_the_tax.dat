40|$|The {{general idea}} is <b>the</b> following: any <b>tax</b> {{authority}} that respects {{basic human rights}} has to impose taxes on a base to avoid random and arbitrary taxation. <b>The</b> <b>tax</b> base should be announced prior to <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> and therefore, taxpayers are given an advanced warning concerning <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base. <b>The</b> advanced warning enables the taxpayers to adjust <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base to <b>the</b> new circumstances {{so that they can}} adjust their behavior to <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax.</b> This adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base by <b>the</b> taxpayer is responsible to <b>the</b> excess burden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax.</b> Retroactive taxes, that is taxes imposed on tax bases determined in the past and that, therefore, cannot be changed by the taxpayers are considered as unethical.

Then, the constitutional rules and principles that should apply for <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulatory framework and during <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> audit were examined. The thesis shows that <b>the</b> current <b>tax</b> audit procedure introduces several constitutional issues. More specifically, <b>the</b> regulatory framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> audit does not agree with <b>the</b> principles <b>of</b> good legislation. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> administration knows almost no strategic planning nor is it stuffed with capable civil servants, which are constantly educated and valuated. In addition, the ambiguous regulatory framework of preventive, temporary and supplementary tax audit may cause contradictions and phenomena <b>of</b> arbitrariness against <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> payers. <b>The</b> same applies for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methods for <b>the</b> simplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> audit procedure, such as <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> computed values and <b>the</b> automated closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> cases. Questions are also raised in connection with <b>the</b> constitutionality <b>of</b> measures, such as <b>the</b> prolonging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute <b>of</b> limitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State to issue tax assessments acts. Moreover, <b>the</b> classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> sanctions as administrative sanctions, though some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> have <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> penal sanctions, has as a result that the taxpayers are not entitled to fundamental defend rights. Furthermore, <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> secrecy is violated by <b>the</b> numerous exemptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> said secrecy. Anti-constitutional limitations are also introduced as far as <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> hearing and <b>the</b> access right are concerned. Finally, the one-dimensional superiority recognised in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public revenue interest indirectly causes many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitutional problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> audit procedure. ...|$|R

Hitherto this aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> system has been neglected. We find that <b>the</b> high rates <b>of</b> taxation combined with <b>the</b> narrowness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> base lead to losses which are very high. Depending upon the assumptions made regarding redistribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revenue and <b>the</b> corrective content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes,</b> <b>the</b> losses are in <b>the</b> neighbourhood <b>of</b> one pound per pound of revenue raised at the margin. ...|$|R
