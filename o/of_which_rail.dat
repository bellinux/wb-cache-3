30|$|Despite {{the support}} of the EU {{in the form of the}} Railway Reform Packages 1 through 4, actual rail freight {{performance}} as a share of the market has been variable. At EU level, rail’s share of the freight market has consistently fallen, against a background of rising total volumes. In the the new member states (EU 12) – in many <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>rail</b> freight was dominant under Communism [11] –a downward trend can be noted, whereas in western member states (EU 15) rail’s share has slightly increased or remained the same [12]. Overall, rail’s modal share of the freight movement in tonne-km declined from 13.6 % in 1995, to 11.9 % in 2011 [13] and further declined to 11.7 % in 2014 [14]. With this reality in mind, in its 2011 Transport White Paper the European Commission set a target of 50 % modal shift from road to rail (and waterways) transport, by 2050, for distances over 300  km. It continues to support this aspiration through policy, regulation, and research and innovation [6].|$|E
