5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card. When he inserts a manual <b>override</b> <b>key,</b> he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mountains}} and valleys south of Rannoch Moor were of key importance in governing both {{the style and}} direction of ice flow during the Loch Lomond Stadial (LLS), and yet have, until now, received limited attention from glacial researchers. New evidence, based on recent geological mapping of the area, shows that a landform-sediment assemblage exists that, at least in part, pre-dates the Loch Lomond Stadial. This last glacial episode was therefore characterised by very limited glacial erosion in this area, and in fact favoured landscape preservation. Geological and geomorphological {{data suggest that the}} former LLS ice cap flowed largely by meltwater-lubricated sliding on rigid beds, with deformation of unconsolidated basal substrate occurring only where pre-existing sediments were <b>overridden.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: Loch Lomond Stadial, ice cap, palaeoglaciology, landscape preservation, superimposed landform...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{a leading}} cause of pneumonia, and many {{components}} of the innate immune system have been proposed to exert important effects in preventing lung infection. However, a vigorous experimental system to identify an <b>overriding,</b> <b>key</b> effector mediating innate immunity to lung infection has not been utilized. As many of the important components of innate immunity are involved in recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to infected tissues, we hypothesized that the cells and factors needed for their proper recruitment to the lung comprised the major mediators of innate immunity. In neutropenic mice, intranasal (i. n.) doses of P. aeruginosa as low as 10 to 100 CFU/mouse produced a fatal lung infection, compared with 107 to > 108 CFU for nonneutropenic mice. There was only a very modest increased mortality in mice lacking mature lymphocytes and no increased mortality in mice depleted of alveolar macrophages when administered i. n. P. aeruginosa. Recombinant mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor increased survival of neutropenic mice after i. n. P. aeruginosa inoculation. MyD 88 −/− mice, which cannot recruit PMNs to the lungs, were highly susceptible to fatal P. aeruginosa lung infection, with bacterial doses of < 120 CFU being lethal. Activation of a MyD 88 -independent pathway for PMN recruitment to the lungs in MyD 88 −/− mice resulted in enhanced protection against P. aeruginosa lung infection. Overall, in the absence of PMNs, mice cannot resist P. aeruginosa lung infection from extremely small bacterial doses. There is an inescapable requirement for local PMN recruitment and activation to mediate innate immunity to P. aeruginosa lung infection...|$|R

50|$|When {{power is}} lost in a {{traction}} elevator system, all elevators will initially come to a halt. One by one, each car in the group {{will return to the}} lobby floor, open its doors and shut down. People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly. Once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service. The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually <b>overridden</b> by a <b>key</b> or strip switch in the lobby. In order to help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors and shut down.|$|R
40|$|New Zealand {{has a low}} {{prevalence}} of both social and environmental reporting, and assurance. However, {{while the number of}} reporters in New Zealand has continued to rise, the amount of assured reporters has been declining. This thesis seeks to understand why assurance practice is declining, what the causal factors are, and why New Zealand appears to be incongruent with rising levels of international assurance practice. It also aims to discover what might drive increased assurance adoption within New Zealand in the future. Through utilising a pilot study of the current trends in New Zealand social and environmental reporting and assurance over a nine year period, the extent of assurance adoption decline is documented. New Zealand's assurance providers, and the country's non-assured, formerly assured, and currently assured organisations are interviewed regarding their position on assurance adoption. Benefits and barriers to assurance, stakeholder use and need for assurance, material differences between New Zealand and international practice, whether assurance is poised to increase in the future, and what will potentially drive assurance in the future are investigated. This thesis discovers several barriers to assurance adoption including: cost, lack of perceived internal and external value, lack of pressure from stakeholders, difficulties surrounding the assurance engagement, under-developed reporting, and assurance having a diminishing value over time. The benefits identified were not as strong as the barriers in most cases. Internal benefits were generally perceived to be greater than the external benefits, as organisations noted questionable credibility enhancement. Overall, a lack of drivers for assurance exists. Lack of stakeholder pressure is the <b>key</b> <b>overriding</b> barrier halting assurance adoption. An increase in assurance adoption could eventuate if increased societal awareness and desire for disclosures, pressure from export markets, and a change in presentation and communication of disclosures occurred...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore in depth the {{historical}} development of university archaeology museums in Jordan from 1962 to the present day. The development of concepts and perspectives is revealed through an exploration of the operation and deployment of institutional mission, staffing, exhibitions, collection development, architecture and spatial arrangement, outreach and funding. In order to achieve a high resolution study, two case studies were selected: the Archaeology Museum at the University of Jordan/Amman (established 1962), which is the earliest example of this kind of museum in the country, and the Museum of Jordanian Heritage at Yarmouk University/Irbid (established 1984), which is considered the most successful of these museums. These two museums represent different stages in the establishment of museum culture in Jordan. A core method adopted in this research is that of oral history, but it also involves examination of the documentary record and the physical attributes of the museums themselves. This study reveals radically different conceptions of the museum in Jordan {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century. The museum at the University of Jordan embodied the values of the 1960 s, which constrained its ambitions and limited its success, while that at Yarmouk University used this earlier model as the antithesis of its vision, shaping a thoroughly modern and outward-looking institution. It did this, in part, by drawing in staff from the older museum. The Yarmouk University Museum, in a country still coming to terms with the museum concept, made itself a modern centre of local and international networks. Indeed, it took on some of the characteristics of a national museum. The factors that made this transformation in museum thinking possible reflect local conditions in Jordan, where the influence of the Royal Family is significant. However, they also reveal the <b>overriding</b> significance of <b>key</b> visionaries and how the country moved from overt Western influence to develop museums which are quintessentially Jordanian...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{the internet is}} used by disabled people in China and focusses in particular on whether internet use can improve their lives and by extension advance China towards a more inclusive civil society. Framing this work are three <b>key</b> <b>overriding</b> issues. First is the rapidly changing and evolving Chinese society and economy, as the country moves from a highly centralised regime to ‘socialism with Chinese characters’. Second is the near absence of disability and disabled people from this process and third is the expanding internet use by Chinese people. There has been very little research on either disability or disabled people in post-reform China {{and one of the}} aims of this thesis was to start to explore and fill the gap. The study attempts to find a contextualised and practical pathway to research disability in China. There are two key elements to the research. First is a broad overview of the use of the internet and the emergence of disability digital communities, using quantitative data from a content analysis of two popular disability forums in China’s cyberspace. This was followed by a series of in-depth interviews with 34 disabled people from across China. The data presented in this qualitative element of the thesis explores the intersection between internet use and economic participation, political engagement and cultural representation of disabled people and disability. The core issues that emerged from the analysis include a discussion on: 1) The internet as a tool for empowerment; 2) The internet as a mechanism for inclusion; 3) The internet as not only a tool but also a sphere; 4) The possibility of establishing a ‘netizenship’, to help access to, improve, or replace the un-developed citizenship in China. Overall, the study concludes that whilst internet use has significantly improved the lives of disabled people, it cannot change their disadvantaged position or promote the social justice of the reforming, digital China. Throughout the research there were concerns on the tensions between western-dominated literature and the specialties of the Chinese context. The thesis critically engages with western theories and methodologies to develop its own specific, contextualised framework. This framework takes account of the multiple dimensions of the disabled experience, the agency of disabled people, and social changes in the context of China’s reform. Only through this, the thesis argues, can disability in China be fully and properly explored...|$|R
