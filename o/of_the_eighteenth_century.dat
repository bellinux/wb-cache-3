5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the number of fossils in British {{collections}} quickly increased. According to an hypothesis published by science historian Robert William Theodor Gunther in 1925, among them was a partial lower jaw of Megalosaurus, acquired in October 1797 by Christopher Pegge for 10s.6d. and added to {{the collection of the}} Anatomy School of Christ Church college.|$|E

40|$|The wakes holiday was {{in origin}} a {{religious}} festival, probably grafted on to earlier pagan observances {{by the early}} Christian missionaries. Taking place on <b>the</b> anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dedication day <b>of</b> a church, which was usually also <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> its patron saint, this essentially lower-class festival survived attacks by the puritans in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries to become part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century's</b> flourishing calendar <b>of</b> customary leisure...|$|R
5|$|Further degrees {{came and}} went, with a ten-degree system {{evolving}} {{at the end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The idea spread widely in Europe, but never appeared in England.

5|$|Romanticism was {{a complex}} artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that {{originated in the}} second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but significantly influenced historiography, philosophy and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite risings, a movement to restore Stuart King James II of England to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process of the destruction of the clan system.

Most of the legislation was repealed by the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> as the Jacobite threat subsided.|$|E

50|$|As the Russian Empire {{gained the}} territories along its western {{frontier}} {{through a series}} of wars and Partitions of Poland that lasted from the 17th through <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> <b>the</b> Uniate Church was partly incorporated into the state Russian Orthodox Church, and in 1839 abolished altogether by <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Synod <b>of</b> Polotsk.

5|$|The Histoire Naturelle was {{translated}} into languages including English, German, Swedish, Russian and Italian. Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional text (for example on insects) and new illustrations, were made at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{and the start of}} the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history. Early translations were necessarily only of the earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes should be taken as approximate.|$|E
5|$|The Whig Monthly Review, {{founded in}} 1749 by Ralph Griffiths, and the Tory Critical Review, founded in 1756 by Tobias Smollett, {{were the first}} {{journals}} dedicated to reviewing books in Britain. Although {{they were joined by}} smaller publications such as the Analytical Review, these two journals dominated reviewing in the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> They focused on poetry, novels, drama, belles-lettres, travel literature, biographies, science writing and other forms of popular literature. They did not review many complex theological or scholarly works, particularly those in foreign languages.|$|E
5|$|The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> saw the {{division}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in three steps, among the neighboring states.

Prussia lost the territory following Napoleon Bonaparte's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition as the resultant 1807 Treaties of Tilsit awarded the area to the Russian Empire, which organized the region into the Belostok Oblast, with the city as the regional center.|$|E

5|$|After the Restoration in 1660, {{there was}} a fashion for grand private houses in designs {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and associated with the architects Sir William Bruce (1630–1710) and James Smith (c. 1645–1731). After the Act of Union in 1707, the threat of Jacobite Rebellions led to the building of military defences such as Fort George near Inverness. Scotland produced {{some of the most}} significant architects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> including Colen Campbell, James Gibbs and William Adam, who all had a major influence on Georgian architecture across Britain. The influence of Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple.|$|E
5|$|All {{editions of}} the book were being printed in Europe until 1941, when the first {{publication}} of {{it was done in}} the United States by I. Bernard Cohen. The book is Franklin's only scientific work, and is recognized by historians Gary F. Kurutz and Dennis Smith as America's most important scientific book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The publication for his scientific observations on electricity made Franklin famous throughout Europe as a serious scientist. Eighteenth-century British polymath Joseph Priestley writes in his book The History and Present State of Electricity (1767) that nobody had written an in-depth study of electricity with the use of scientific experimentation like this of Franklin's that had been translated into most European languages in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E

5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} {{had come to}} be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that {{attracted the attention of}} artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E
