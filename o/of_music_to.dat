5|$|At {{the first}} {{performances}} of Parsifal {{problems with the}} moving scenery during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the Hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>to</b> cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E
5|$|The group {{ran through}} {{two weeks of}} rehearsals using The Rolling Stones' {{basement}} studio in Bermondsey. They had not intended to record a single continuous piece; the band came up with individual song segments, then decided to write short pieces <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>to</b> link them together.|$|E

5|$|The {{songs and}} musical score {{used in the}} film were {{composed}} and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from Africa addio, as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and closing credits. The arrangement <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>to</b> enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in Africa addio.|$|E
5|$|About 70% {{of schools}} teach {{music at the}} lower {{secondary}} level. Many of the schools that do not normally instruct in music may offer volunteer clubs or other more informal opportunities for musical enrichment. Many Lucian schools have formed ensembles, most commonly a wind ensemble (30% of schools), or a steelpan band (20%) or combo group (20%). The public education field has also collaborated with the Saint Lucia School <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> <b>to</b> form the National Youth Choir, String Orchestra and Secondary Schools Wind Ensemble. The governmental Ministry of Education also sponsors a number of festivals and musical special events, both {{for the benefit of}} all students and the enrichment of the musically-gifted among them.|$|E
5|$|Fuck It, We'll Do It Live {{received}} a generally positive reception from music critics. Metal Storm reviewed the release {{and described the}} album as an ideal introduction to Wednesday 13, comparing the style <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>to</b> glam punk. Metal Ireland recommended the music for its simple, B-movie quality. Global Domination wrote that the album broke the trend of inadvisable purchases of live performances. The release received favorable reviews from Metal.de and MusicWaves; the latter compared the album's style to that of Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson. The Swedish-language review site Hallowed.se found the recording to be unexciting.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled Makeba: My Story. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She {{took part in the}} Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's Wembley Stadium, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>to</b> raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{lead role}} of Maria von Trapp {{in the new}} West End {{production}} of The Sound <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> <b>to</b> be staged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian, was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson.

25|$|African-American {{music is}} rooted in the {{typically}} polyrhythmic music of the ethnic groups of Africa, specifically those in the Western, Sahelean, and Sub-Saharan regions. African oral traditions, nurtured in slavery, encouraged the use <b>of</b> <b>music</b> <b>to</b> pass on history, teach lessons, ease suffering, and relay messages. The African pedigree of African-American music is evident in some common elements: call and response, syncopation, percussion, improvisation, swung notes, blue notes, the use of falsetto, melisma, and complex multi-part harmony. During slavery, Africans in America blended traditional European hymns with African elements to create spirituals.|$|E
