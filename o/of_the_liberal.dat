The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E

5|$|Nelson's {{leadership}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party was {{beset by}} poor opinion poll numbers. There was speculation that Turnbull would challenge Nelson for {{the leadership in}} late 2008; however, Nelson caught Turnbull by surprise by calling a snap spill of the party's leadership positions while Turnbull was returning from an overseas holiday. The spill was moved on 16 September 2008. Turnbull defeated Nelson by four votes, becoming the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party and of the Opposition Coalition between the Liberals and the National Party. Nelson later resigned from the House of Representatives.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, Charlton faced {{another former}} Ward 7 councillor, Terry Anderson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conservatives and local lawyer Tyler Banham <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberals.</b> Despite an {{aggressive}} internet campaign on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberals,</b> <b>the</b> race became a New Democrat-Conservative match, which saw Charlton increase voter support despite a lower voter turnout than in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The United Party {{emerged from}} a faction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{decaying}} <b>Liberal</b> Party known as [...] "the National Party" [...] (not {{directly related to the}} modern National Party, although it may have inspired the name). George Forbes, a Liberal Party leader, led the faction. In 1927 Forbes joined with Bill Veitch (who led another faction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberals,</b> but who had once been involved with the labour movement) and with Albert Davy (a well-known and highly successful organiser for the Reform Party, <b>the</b> traditional opponent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberals).</b> They hoped that the United Party would draw support not only from former Liberals, but from moderates on either the right or left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberals</b> by promoting themselves as a safer alternative than the Labour Party.|$|R

Soon after the battalion's arrival in South Africa, however, Herchmer's superior, Major General Edward Hutton, concluded that Herchmer was unsuited for military command and retired him from duty. Herchmer complained to the Prime Minister, who then dismissed him from the police altogether, replacing him with Aylesworth Perry, a career policeman and a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> government.|$|E

His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Liberal</b> in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.|$|E
