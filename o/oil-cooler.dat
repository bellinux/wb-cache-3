50|$|Porsche was serious. Unlike {{during the}} rather modest earlier years, four cars were {{entered in the}} 1968 24 Hours of Daytona, {{supported}} by 20 mechanics and engineers. The drivers wore cooling vests developed by NASA as the <b>oil-cooler</b> and the hot oil pipes caused heat in the closed cockpit.|$|E
50|$|The {{exhaust system}} was also changed, gone were the dual {{silencers}} {{and replaced with}} one stainless steel silencer on the right side. The transmission output shaft was lengthened to accommodate a wider wheel. A new curved <b>oil-cooler</b> design and oil lines (attached to the oil pan similar to the original 85-87 engines) were installed.|$|E

Based on this model, the robust predictive PI control law is derived based on the minimization of a generalized predictive performance criterion. Stability Robustness of the overall system is studied in some detail.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} methodologies {{and techniques}} for the design, analysis, {{and implementation of}} a model reference adaptive predictive temperature controller for a variable-frequency <b>oil-cooling</b> machine, suited for cooling high-speed machine tools. The <b>oil-cooling</b> process is modeled experimentally as a first-order system model with a time delay and its system parameters are identified using the recursive least-square method. Based on this model, a model reference adaptive predictive controller is proposed for achieving set-point tracking and robustness. A real-time model reference adaptive predictive control algorithm is then presented and implemented utilizing a stand-alone digital signal processor TMS 320 F 243 from Texas Instruments Incorporated.

5000|$|The 930 {{remained}} {{available in}} Europe, and for 1983 a [...] performance option became {{available on a}} build-to-order basis from Porsche. With the add-on came a four-pipe exhaust system and an additional <b>oil-cooler</b> requiring a remodelled front spoiler and units bearing the add-on often featured additional ventilation holes in the rear fenders and modified rockers.|$|E
50|$|The DB6 {{continued}} with then high-tech Armstrong Selectaride cockpit-adjustable rear shock absorbers as {{available on the}} DB5. Other highlights include adopting front-door quarter windows, an <b>oil-cooler</b> air scoop low on the front valance, quarter-bumpers at each corner, revised tail-lamp clusters; additionally the spoiler affected the overall proportions of the DB6, {{with an increase in}} length by approximately two inches.|$|E
5000|$|His {{first race}} was in 1949, at a BARC meeting driving a Fiat 1100 special, which he built himself: [...] "very neat was Pierpont's (sic) F.I.A.T. 1,100 with {{aerodynamic}} but not all-enveloping bodywork, two Amal carburetters, a neat silencer in its straight exhaust pipe and an <b>oil-cooler</b> {{ahead of the}} main radiator." [...] He finished seventh in a 3-lap handicap.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a direct self-tuning model-following control with integral action for a variable-frequency <b>oil-cooling</b> process, suitable for cooling down high-speed machine tools. The <b>oil-cooling</b> process is experimentally modelled as a first-order {{system with a}} given time-delay. Based on this model, a direct self-tuning model-following control with integral action is proposed for achieving set-point tracking and disturbance rejection. A real-time adaptive predictive control algorithm is then presented and implemented utilizing a standalone digital signal processor (DSP). In comparison with the control method of Tsai and Huang, the proposed method provides a more practical and less computationally intensive approach for achieving the desired high-precision set-point tracking and disturbance rejection. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed control method is capable of giving a satisfactory set-point tracking performance under set-point changes, fixed loads, and load changes...|$|R
25|$|The {{choice of}} annular {{radiators}} for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and <b>oil-cooling</b> radiators (integrated within the annular design) {{to be as}} short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.|$|R
40|$|High {{power and}} {{miniaturization}} of motors in an in-wheel drive system, which is installed inside {{the wheels of}} a vehicle, are required for directly driving the wheels. In addition, an efficient cooling system is required to ensure high driving performance and durability. This study experimentally evaluated the heat dissipation performance of a 35 -kW-class large-capacity in-wheel motor equipped with an internal-circulation-type <b>oil-cooling</b> system that exhibits high cooling performance and can be easily miniaturized to this motor. Temperatures of the coil and stator core of cooling systems with and without a radiator were measured in real time under in-wheel motor driving conditions. It was found that operating the cooling system at a continuous-rating maximum speed without the radiator was difficult. We confirmed that under continuous-rating base speed and continuous-rating maximum speed driving conditions, the cooling system with the radiator showed thermally stable operation. Furthermore, under maximum-rating base speed and maximum-rating maximum speed driving conditions, the cooling system with the radiator provided additional driving times of approximately 22 s and 2 s, respectively. electric vehicle; in-wheel motor; <b>oil-cooling</b> system; radiator; thermal performanc...|$|R
50|$|The engine {{featured}} a standard <b>oil-cooler</b> and a distinctive, unusual exhaust system, {{a first for}} Honda, with cross-over pipes {{directly in front of}} the engine linking cylinders one to four and a separate pair of pipes connecting cylinders two and three. The CV carburettors were of a new type using mixture-enriching internal fuel passages for cold-starts, with careful engineering of the inlet tracts to achieve smooth gasflow.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{change was}} an upgrade to the 2778 cc L M130 engine with [...] maximum power and 180 lbft Nm maximum torque, which finally gave the W 113 {{adequate}} power. The performance improvement {{was achieved by}} increasing bore by 4.5 mm, which stretched {{the limits of the}} M180 block, and required pairwise cylinder casts without cooling water passages. This mandated an <b>oil-cooler,</b> which was fitted vertically next to the radiator. Each engine was now bench-tested for two hours prior to being fitted, so their power specification was guaranteed at last.|$|E
5000|$|James Martin, broadly {{responding}} to Specification F.5/34 for a fighter using an air-cooled engine for hot climates, designed a fighter using the simple basic structure employed and developed in his earlier MB1. Constructed of steel tubing, the MB2 incorporated many detailed improvements which further simplified production {{as well as}} repair and maintenance. Powered by a special Napier Dagger III HIM 24-cylinder H-type engine of 805 nominal bhp, but capable of operation at 13 lb boost to give over 1,000 hp for takeoff, driving a fixed-pitch, two-blade propeller, the MB2 was capable of 300+ mph (480 km/h) speeds [...] "on paper." [...] The undercarriage was fixed but cleanly faired in two trouser-type fairings, the port one carrying the <b>oil-cooler.</b> A retractable undercarriage to improve performance was [...] "in the works" [...] when the design was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|A {{servo drive}} turret punch press uses twin AC servo drives {{directly}} coupled to the drive shaft. This drive system combines {{the simplicity of}} the original clutch and brake technology with the speed of a hydraulic ram driven system. This results in high performance, reliability, and lower operating costs. A servo drive press system has no complex hydraulics or <b>oil-cooling</b> chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{predictive control}} with recurrent neural network prediction for industrial processes is presented. The neural predictive control law with integral action is derived {{based on the}} minimization of a modified predictive performance criterion. The stability and steady-state performance of the closed-loop control system are well studied. Numerical simulations reveal that the proposed control gives satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performance for two illustrative nonlinear systems with time-delay. Experimental results for temperature control of a variable-frequency <b>oil-cooling</b> process show {{the efficacy of the}} proposed method for industrial processes with set-points changes and load disturbances...|$|R
50|$|Previous BMW {{motorcycles}} {{used the}} airhead engines {{such as the}} type 247 air-cooled flat-twin with two pushrod-activated valves per cylinder. The R1100GS engine introduced partial <b>oil-cooling</b> and four valves per cylinder operated by a single chain-driven camshaft. Motronic fuel injection was included instead of the carburettors found on earlier bikes. Rear suspension and driveshaft used the same Paralever swingarm system as the previous bikes, but {{with the addition of}} remote pre-load adjustment on the shock absorber. Front suspension used a new A-arm system called Telelever. Options included heated handlebar grips and ABS.|$|R
5000|$|The Courier was {{powered by}} a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III, a four {{cylinder}} air-cooled inverted inline engine, driving a two-bladed propeller. Its <b>oil-cooler</b> was placed under the engine where, in winter, engine heat could keep the oil fluid. The Courier's fuselage was roughly quadrilateral in section and built on welded steel tube Warren girder frames, though the upper decking was rounded. Mail was contained within a [...] compartment immediately behind the engine with a weight limit of 250 lb. An open but heated cockpit was placed aft of the trailing edge, the pilot's upward vision enhanced by the short chord centre-section. At the rear, tailplane and elevators, nearly rectangular in plan, were mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage. The Courier could be trimmed by adjusting the angle of incidence of the tailplane. The fin and rudder were tall and rounded; the latter extended down to the keel and worked in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
50|$|The Monza, however, {{sharing the}} same layout as the Senator A1, had very good driving abilities. It handled quite well, thanks to the newly {{developed}} MacPherson strut system for {{the front of the}} car, as used on the Rekord E1 and E2, and the new (previously Opel had always used a non-independent rear axle on the Rekord E1 and E2, Manta, Ascona etc.) independent rear suspension gave the car soft, yet firm and capable, driving characteristics and excellent stability for such a big car. The engine range, however non-economical, was also very good, and few problems with the extremely reliable engines, even today, some 30 years later. The 6-cylinder engines where all of the CIH type (camshaft in head) and were in reality a 2.0-litre straight 4 with just 2 more cylinders. Many parts on the engine, such as the water pump and drive train, are in fact the same parts as used on the 4-cylinder version. This meant that this was an engine not only tested for many years in the Commodore, Admiral and Diplomat range, but also very reliable. Although the first generation of 3.0E engines in the Monza A1 had overheating problems when standing still, this could easily be fixed by fitting an <b>oil-cooler.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Kawasaki GPz750 was a sport bike {{introduced}} by Kawasaki in 1982. It {{was more than}} a warmed-over KZ750, as it was improved in many areas, focusing on high-performance. Changes started at the front, with tapered bearings in the steering head instead of the KZ750's ball bearings, and the upper triple clamp was changed also, giving the GPz solid aluminum clip-on handle grips instead of the traditional handlebar. A bikini fairing almost identical to the one on the GPz550 was added too. The GPz750 boasted increased power, with slightly higher compression, and camshafts designed to get the valves to full lift quicker, and fitting Mikuni 34mm carburetors to it for smoother airflow. The cylinder heads were also given a new combustion chamber with a 'squish zone' and porting & polishing from the factory. To maintain reliability oil passages were installed under the pistons for increased cooling, and an <b>oil-cooler</b> was added. The GPz750 was the quickest factory 750, as Cycle World recorded a time of 11.93 seconds at 109.62 mph in the 1/4 mile. The GPz750 underwent some significant changes in 1983. The original was based on the 1981 KZ750-E. Kawasaki retired the KZ750 after 1983. The 1983 KZ750L3 was nearly identical to the '82 GPz750, but for different colors, no bikini fairing, and without the porting & polishing in the cylinder head.|$|E
50|$|The {{core of the}} {{electric}} system is the 3-blade main transformer with <b>oil-cooling.</b> The control unit has 30 power notches, semi-automatic in operation. The settings are thyristor controlled and the thyristor voltage is regulated by phase cutting, which was a novelty for series locomotives in the GDR. All units are equipped with a catenery-current-controlled electric brake. The safety equipment in the driver's cab has an electronic deadman's brake (Sifa), “punctiform” automatic train controls (PZB 90), and train radio equipment with GSM-R communication. Relatively recently, computers were added for the electronic timetable EBuLa.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{prototype}} He 100 V2 {{addressed the}} stability problems {{by changing the}} vertical stabilizer from a triangular form to a larger and more rectangular form. The <b>oil-cooling</b> system continued to be problematic, so it was removed and replaced with a small semi retractable radiator below the wing. It also received the still-experimental DB 601M engine which the aircraft was originally designed for. The M version was modified to run on [...] "C3" [...] fuel at 100 octane, which would allow it to run at higher power ratings in the future.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the fixed}} {{parts of the}} engine, such as the block and head, are cooled {{directly}} by the main coolant system. Moving parts such as the pistons, {{and to a lesser}} extent the crank and rods, must rely on the lubrication oil as a coolant, or to a very limited amount of conduction into the block and thence the main coolant. High performance engines frequently have additional oil, beyond the amount needed for lubrication, sprayed upwards onto the bottom of the piston just for extra cooling. Air-cooled motorcycles often rely heavily on <b>oil-cooling</b> in addition to air-cooling of the cylinder barrels.|$|R
5000|$|... 1986: Rick Mears won {{the pole}} {{position}} with a lap of 223.401 mph, a new closed-course Indy car record, but crashed his car during a practice run the following day. Mears' car was repaired, but he eventually dropped {{out with a}} blown engine. Rain and attrition {{was the story of}} the day. After 18 laps, a heavy rain storm brought out a red flag and a 90-minute delay. After the restart, many cars dropped out including Roberto Guerrero, who crashed while leading on lap 47. Indy 500 winner Bobby Rahal came to the lead in the second half, with Johnny Rutherford having worked his way up to second. Rutherford took the lead on lap 196, and 25 laps later, Rahal's engine blew. Rutherford was now ahead by 25 seconds over Josele Garza, and running fast laps in the 217 mph range. A late caution set up a restart with four laps to go. The depleted field had only 7 cars still running, and Rutherford held off Garaza to win by 1.82 seconds. It was Rutherford's 27th and final win of his career, and he became the first driver to win all four 500 miles races (Indianapolis, Ontario, Pocono, Michigan) in his career. Al Unser, Jr. somehow limped around to an 8th-place finish with no wings, a bashed nosecone, and an <b>oil-cooler</b> hastily wired to the gearbox.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Cleveland altitude wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics and the oil delivery critical altitude of the <b>oil-cooler</b> installation of an XTB 2 D- 1 airplane. The {{investigation was}} made with the propeller removed end with the engine operating at 1800 brake horsepower, an altitude of 15, 000 feet (except for tests of oil-delivery critical altitude), <b>oil-cooler</b> flap deflections from - 20 degrees to 20 degrees and inclinations of the thrust axis of 0 degrees, 1. 5 degrees, and 6 degrees. At an inclination of the thrust axis of 0 degrees and with the propeller operating, the total-pressure recovery coefficient at {{the face of the}} oil cooler varied from 0. 84 to 1. 10 depending on the flap deflection. With the propeller removed, the best pressure recovery at the face of the oil cooler was obtained at an inclination of the thrust axis of 1. 5 degrees. Air-flow separation occurred on the inner surface of the upper lip of the <b>oil-cooler</b> duct inlet at an inclination of the thrust axis of 0 degrees and on the inner surface of the lower lip at 6 degrees. Static pressure coefficients over the duct lips were sufficiently low that no trouble from compressibility would be encountered in level flight. The oil-delivery critical altitude at cruising power (2230 rpm, 1675 bhp) was approximately 18, 500 feet for the oil system tested...|$|E

Final cowl configurations possessed ample engine and <b>oil-cooler</b> pressure drops for cooling in the critical normal-power climb condition {{with any of the}} three baffle configurations tested. The indicated critical Mach number of the cowling was found to be 0. 70 as determined by the pressure on the lower lip of the inlet...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a design methodology for predictive control of industrial processes via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A discrete-time mathematical model using RNN is established and a multi-step neural predictor is then constructed. With the predictor, a neural predictive control (NPC) law is {{developed from the}} generalized predictive performance criterion. Both the RNN model and the NPC controller are proven convergent based on Lyapunov stability theory. Two examples of a nonlinear process system and a physical variable-frequency <b>oil-cooling</b> machine are used to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed control method.

5000|$|An [...] "Oilhead" [...] {{is a name}} to {{describe}} BMW flat-twin motorcycle engines with partial <b>oil-cooling,</b> and to distinguish these engines from the earlier air-cooled [...] "Airhead" [...] models. [...] The Oilhead's finned cylinders have conventional air-cooling, but the four-valve cylinder-heads are oil-cooled. Unlike earlier BMW boxers which had a single camshaft in the crankcase (variously above or below the crankshaft), the Oilhead has a camshaft in each head. (It is still technically an ohv engine rather than a true sohc unit, as the camshaft bears onto very short pushrods which operate valve rockers). In 2013, BMW introduced water-cooling to its boxer range. The engine is still used in just one line of motorcycles the BMW R nineT.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the drag characteristics of the HU 2 K helicopter fuselage. The effects of body shape, engine operation, appendages, and leakage on the model drag were determined. The results of the tests showed that the largest single contribution to the parasite drag {{was that of the}} rotor hub installation which produced about 80 percent of the drag of the sealed and faired production body. Fairings on the rotor hub and blade retentions, or a cleaned-up hub and retentions, appeared to be the most effective single modifications tested. The total drag of all protuberances and air leakage also contributed {{a major part of the}} drag - an 83 -percent increase over the drag of the sealed and faired production body. An additional increment of drag was caused by the basic shape of the fuselage - 19 percent more than the drag obtained when the fuselage shape was extensively refaired. Another sizable increment of drag was caused by the engine <b>oil-cooler</b> exit which gave a drag of 8 percent of that of the sealed and faired production body...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{investigates the}} thermal {{influences}} of CO 2 - and <b>oil-cooling</b> on {{the precision of}} a machine tool. If CO 2 is used for process cooling instead of oil, a different temperature distribution in the machine is observed. Different temperature distributions lead to different tool center point (TCP) -displacements. To measure TCP-displacements under real process conditions with CO 2 and oil, a special measurement setup is designed, built and applied. A representative process for the machine is chosen to compare the different process coolings. The {{results show that the}} choice of coolant has a crucial influence on the TCP-displacements. It is shown that the thermally induced displacements can be reduced by 15 μm in y-direction, but increase about 4 μm in x-direction, when the coolant is changed from oil to CO 2...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the mechanical and thermal {{design of a}} high speed, high power density synchronous permanent magnet machine for an aero engine starter generator system with a power rating of 150 kW and maximum speed of 32, 000 rpm. As both mechanical and thermal aspects have {{a direct impact on}} machine overall performance and weight reduction, a critical design optimisation was carried out. Intensive cooling is guaranteed by direct liquid <b>oil-cooling</b> of stationary components; a stator sleeve is also introduced into the airgap to prevent excessive windage. Thermal investigations were carried out by the means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Lumped Parameter Thermal Network (LPTN) analyses.

40|$|In this article, an {{integrated}} thermal model is numerically analyzed {{to calculate the}} heat generation of spindle bearings and temperature distribution of the spindle system, with consideration of the operating conditions and lubrication conditions, such as rotation speed, preload, and oil film thickness. Surface roughness is an important parameter of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, which is measured by an optical topographer and characterized by statistical parameters. The experimental measurement system of the precision spindle is composed {{of a set of}} laser triangulation sensors and thermal infrared imagers. After the thermal characteristics, mathematical models are experimentally verified, and the effects of cooling oil temperature, cooling oil flow rate, and characteristic dimensions of the cooling channel on keeping the spindle gradient are analyzed in detail.
