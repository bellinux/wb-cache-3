5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> craton.|$|E

Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Dialects of {{killer whales}} not only {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types.

Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.|$|E
