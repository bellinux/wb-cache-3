40|$|The winter {{advance of}} the sea ice edge in the Bellingshausen Sea is {{frequently}} interrupted by periods of rapid retreat lasting a few days. The frequency and duration of such events strongly controls {{the location of the}} late winter sea ice edge in this sector of the Antarctic. We examine the dynamics and thermodynamics of a retreat event that occurred in May 2001 using data from a drifting buoy array together with diagnostics from a kinematic/thermodynamic ice growth model and a high-resolution (11 km) regional coupled ocean-ice model. During the retreat event, the ice edge retreated by 250 km over 13 days in response to strong and persistent northerly winds associated with a quasi-stationary low-pressure system. Ice motion in the outer part of the pack was convergent and correlated strongly with local wind forcing. By contrast, in the region closer to the coast, ice motion was less well correlated with wind forcing. Model diagnostics indicate that ice thickening resulting from convergence in the <b>outer</b> <b>pack</b> was largely balanced by basal melting. In the <b>outer</b> <b>pack,</b> ice was in a state close to free drift while, closer to the coast, internal ice stresses became significant. The ocean-ice model simulated the characteristics of the retreat event realistically, giving us confidence in the ability of such models to reproduce ice conditions in this sector...|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch <b>packs.</b> The <b>outer</b> clutch <b>pack</b> drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the <b>outer</b> clutch <b>pack</b> has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the optimal product unpacking location in a bricks-and-mortar grocery retail supply chain. Retail companies increasingly are investing in unpacking operations at their distribution centres (DC). Given the opportunity to unpack at the DC requires a decision as to which products should be selected for unpacking at the DC and which should be shipped to stores in a case pack (CP) or <b>outer</b> <b>pack</b> provided by the supplier. The combined unpacking and unit size decision is evaluated by focusing on the relevant costs at the DC and in-store, i. e., picking in the DC, unpacking either in the DC or in the store, shelf stacking in the store and refilling from the backroom. For replenishing stores, an (R, s, nQ) inventory policy is considered when using the supplier CP and a (R, s, S) policy when the product is unpacked at the DC. Expressions are developed to quantify the relevant volumes and to calculate the corresponding costs on which the unpacking decision is based. A numerical example with empirical data from a European modern retailer demonstrates that unpacking a subset of the stock keeping units (SKUs) at the DC results in a significant cost reduction potential of 8 % compared to no unpacking at the DC. The example shows that DC unpacking can generally be highly favorable for a large share of products...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that significant changes have occurred in patterns of sea ice seasonality in West Antarctica since 1979, with wide-ranging climatic, biological and biogeochemical consequences. Here, we provide the first detailed report on long-term change and variability in annual timings of sea ice advance, retreat and resultant ice season duration in East Antarctica. These were calculated from satellite-derived ice concentration data for the period 1979 / 80 to 2009 / 10. The pattern of change in sea ice seasonality off East Antarctica comprises mixed signals on regional to local scales, with pockets of strongly positive and negative trends occurring in near juxtaposition in certain regions e. g., Prydz Bay. This pattern strongly reflects change and variability in different elements of the marine "icescape", including fast ice, polynyas and the marginal ice zone. A trend towards shorter sea-ice duration (of 1 to 3 days per annum) occurs in fairly isolated pockets in the <b>outer</b> <b>pack</b> from∼ 95 - 110 °E, and in various near-coastal areas that include an area of particularly strong and persistent change near Australia's Davis Station and between the Amery and West Ice Shelves. These areas are largely associated with coastal polynyas that are important as sites of enhanced sea ice production/melt. Areas of positive trend in ice season duration are more extensive, and include an extensive zone from 160 - 170 °E (i. e., the western Ross Sea sector) and the near-coastal zone between 40 - 100 °E. The East Antarctic pattern is considerably {{more complex than the}} well-documented trends in West Antarctica e. g., in the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea and western Ross Sea sectors...|$|E
40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Packaging uses nearly 40 % of all polymers, a {{substantial}} share {{of which is}} used for sensitive merchandise such as moisture-sensitive food. To find out if bio-based materials are environmentally advantageous for this demanding application, we compared laminated, printed film across the whole life cycle. Materials and methods We compared bio-based materials (paper, polylactic acid, bio-based polyethylene, and a bio-based polyester) as well as conventional ones (polypropylene, polyethylene). Data stemmed from 13 companies that produce raw materials, films and/or laminates and which co-operated with us in a project commissioned by a large food producer. The functional unit chosen for this study is 1 m 2 of packaging film. This is (mostly) laminated, printed film that is delivered on reels to the food industry, where the laminate is cut, sealed and filled. The impact assessment is presented for non-renewable energy use, total energy use, global warming potential, depletion of abiotic resources, photo-oxidant formation, acidification, eutrophication, water use, and land use. Results For Inner Packs that get {{in direct contact with}} food and therefore require certain barrier properties, the environmental performance of many laminates is not better than the reference, petrochemical material. However, our study shows that paper/polypropylene laminates perform equally well as the current material (polypropylene) if the material is landfilled, and better if incinerated with energy recovery. For Outer Packs, bio-based polyethylene film shows a particularly low environmental impact. Paper/bio-based polyester laminates also offer significant savings compared with the current material. For Inner as well as Outer Packs, laminates including polylactic acid offer environmental advantages when accounting for wind credits or when assuming a future technology level for polymer or film production. Discussion Increased technology maturity of PLA and cellulose in the film production stage offers significant environmental improvement with respect to global warming potential compared with today’s technology. Though large, the uncertainty regarding the degree of degradation of paper, cellulose, PLA and bio-based polyester, is not decisive for the conclusions. Conclusions and recommendations Generally, laminates and films (partly) consisting of bio-based polymers offer opportunities for significantly reducing environmental impacts of food packaging. Large variations in land-use are possible {{depending on the type of}} bio-based material that is used. The environmental advantages differ depending on the polymer and the final product (Inner vs. <b>Outer</b> <b>Pack).</b> Lack of experience and investment in converting bio-based polymers into final products and comparatively unfavourable material properties result in lower environmental advantages for some novel bio-based materials than one may expect. However, a) already today, the options with the lowest global warming potential are partly or fully bio-based and b) bio-based materials will benefit more from technological progress than conventional materials, potentially making certain bio-based laminates highly attractive options for the future. Overall, Outer Packs are more promising than Inner Packs when introducing bio-based wrappings to replace the current petrochemical material because a) the opportunities are clearer for this application and b) the product specifications (required barrier properties) are less demanding. Starting with the Outer Packs would also allow bio-based polymer producers and processors to invest and learn, thus offering the opportunity to reduce the environmental impact even further...|$|E

40|$|The {{cell wall}} of the human {{pathogen}} Candida glabrata governs initial host-pathogen interactions that underlie the establishment of fungal infections. With the aim of identifying species-specific features that may directly relate to its virulence, we have investigated the cell wall of C. glabrata using a multidisciplinary approach that combines microscopy imaging, biochemical studies, bioinformatics, and tandem mass spectrometry. Electron microscopy revealed a bilayered wall structure in which the <b>outer</b> layer is <b>packed</b> with mannoproteins. Biochemical studies showed that C. glabrata walls incorporate 50 % more protein than Saccharomyces cerevisiae walls and, consistent with this, have a higher mannose/glucose ratio. Evidence is presented that C. glabrata walls contain glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) proteins, covalently bound to the wall 1, 6 -beta-glucan, as well as proteins linked through a mild-alkali-sensitive linkage to 1, 3 -beta-glucan. A comprehensive genome-wide in silico inspection showed that in comparison to other fungi, C. glabrata contains an exceptionally large number, 67, of genes encoding adhesin-like GPI proteins. Phylogenetically these adhesin-like proteins form different clusters, {{one of which is}} the lectin-like EPA family. Mass spectrometric analysis identified 23 cell wall proteins, including 4 novel adhesin-like proteins, Awp 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, and Epa 6, which is involved in adherence to human epithelia and biofilm formation. Importantly, the presence of adhesin-like proteins in the wall depended on the growth stage and on the genetic background used, and this was reflected in alterations in adhesion capacity and cell surface hydrophobicity. We propose that the large repertoire of adhesin(-like) genes of C. glabrata contributes to its adaptability and virulenc...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the Knelson Concentrator {{has become}} the {{predominant}} unit used for primary gold recovery by gravity. However, its application potential as a cleaner in the final gravity concentration stage and its separation mechanisms have not been well studied. In most Canadian gold mills, rougher gravity concentrates produced by the Knelson (operating at 60 gravity acceleration or 'g') are further upgraded with shaking tables, non-centrifuge units operating at one 'g'. As a result, tabling results in significant gold losses (mainly fines). It is also labour intensive and represents a security risk {{because of the high}} gold content of the material being processed. The main objectives of this research, therefore, are to study the separation mechanisms of the Knelson Concentrator and to explore its potential application as a cleaner to supplement, or even to replace, tabling. A methodology based on the use of synthetic feeds (tungsten, silica and magnetite) was designed to study the performance and mechanisms of a 7. 5 cm Knelson. Four types of gangue were used, both fine and coarse silica and magnetite. The fluidization water flowrate was optimized for each gangue type, and the Knelson was then overloaded by feeding a high-grade feed. The extent of overload was found to be highly dependent on the size distribution and density of the gangue processed, from severe and immediate with coarse magnetite to non-existent with fine silica. A two-parameter model to describe the overload was derived, which showed a good fit with the experimental data. Two separable bowls were designed to analyze the nature of the material recovered in the five grooves of the Knelson bowl. It was found that the densest minerals, such as tungsten and gold, were mainly recovered in the inner groove sections, closest to the rotating axis. The <b>outer</b> sections <b>packed</b> {{at the beginning of the}} recovery cycle and served mostly to distribute fluidization water evenly. Three modified Knelson bowls, a cleaner bowl equipped with a filter at the bottom of each groove, the other two with different groove depth and fluidization water flowrate distribution, were tested using the synthetic feed methodology. Results generally confirmed the soundness of the basic designs of the conventional and cleaning bowls. The importance of superficial fluidization water velocity was also demonstrated. Recovery of gold with the 7. 5 cm Knelson from seven samples of gold table tails from different Canadian gold mills was tested. Recovery significantly increased when the coarser, largely barren fraction was removed prior to processing. Concentrate grade significantly increased, up to 60 % Au, by feeding a magnetite "filler" prior to the recovery cycle, and removing it magnetically at the end of the test, to mimic the effect of the cleaner bowl...|$|R
40|$|Rod {{responses}} to brief pulses of light were recorded as electroretinogram (ERG) mass potentials across isolated, aspartate-superfused rat retinas at different temperatures and intensities of steady background light. The {{objective was to}} clarify to what extent differences in sensitivity, response kinetics and light adaptation between mammalian and amphibian rods {{can be explained by}} temperature and outer-segment size without assuming functional differences in the phototransduction molecules. Corresponding information for amphibian rods from the literature was supplemented by new recordings from toad retina. All light intensities were expressed as photoisomerizations per rod (Rh*). In the rat retina, an estimated 34 % of incident photons at the wavelength of peak sensitivity caused isomerizations in rods, as the (hexagonally <b>packed)</b> <b>outer</b> segments measured 1. 7 μm × 22 μm and had specific absorbance of 0. 016 μm− 1 on average. Fractional sensitivity (S) in darkness increased with cooling in a similar manner in rat and toad rods, but the rat function as a whole was displaced to a ca 0. 7 log unit higher sensitivity level. This difference can be fully explained by the smaller dimensions of rat rod outer segments, since the same rate of phosphodiesterase (PDE) activation by activated rhodopsin will produce a faster drop in cGMP concentration, hence a larger response in rat than in toad. In the range 15 – 25 °C, the waveform and absolute time scale of dark-adapted dim-flash photoresponses at any given temperature were similar in rat and toad, although the overall temperature dependence of the time to peak (tp) was somewhat steeper in rat (Q 10 ≈ 4 versus 2 – 3). Light adaptation was similar in rat and amphibian rods when measured at the same temperature. The mean background intensity that depressed S by 1 log unit at 12 °C was in the range 20 – 50 Rh* s− 1 in both, compared with ca 4500 Rh* s− 1 in rat rods at 36 °C. We conclude that {{it is not necessary to}} assume major differences in the functional properties of the phototransduction molecules to account for the differences in response properties of mammalian and amphibian rods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{investigation of the}} formation of supported lipid membranes with vesicle hemifusion, their stability under detergents and organic solvents and their applications in molecular biology. In Chapter 3, we describe how isolated patches of DOPC bilayers supported on glass surfaces are dissolved by various detergents (decyl maltoside, dodecyl maltoside, CHAPS, CTAB, SDS, TritonX- 100 and Tween 20) at their CMC, as investigated by fluorescence video microscopy. In general, detergents partition into distal leafets of bilayers and lead to the expansion of the bilayers through a rolling motion of the distal over the proximal leaflets, in agreement with the first stage of the established 3 -stage model of lipid vesicle solubilization by detergents. However, solubilization pathways are different for different detergents. For decyl/dodecyl maltoside, CHAPS and SDS, dissolution of bilayers starts only once the bilayers reach a critical lipid:detergent ratio in the bilayers, whereas for CTAB, TritonX and Tween 20, dissolution starts once detergents partition into the bilayers. From the expansion dynamics of bilayers, we conclude that the energy loss due to the partitioning of detergents is balanced by the released heat and the increment of the planar bilayer 2 ̆ 7 s curvature energy. Moreover, in contrast to a previous view that detergents need to be present on both leaflets of bilayers to initiate solubilization, we find that detergents in the distal leaflets of bilayers are sufficient to induce micellization. Lastly, we estimate the energy barrier for detergents to partition into lipid bilayers and find it is on the order of 3 to 7 kT. Subsequently, we study the partitioning of organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol, acetone and chloroform) into isolated bilayer patches on glass in Chapter 4 with fluorescence microscopy. The area expansion of bilayers due to the partitioning of organic solvents is measured. From the titration of organic solvents, we measured the rate of area expansion {{as a function of the}} volume fraction of organic solvents, which is proposed to be a measure of strength of interactions between solvents and membranes. From the same experiments, we also measure the maximum expansion of bilayers (or the maximum binding stoichiometry between organic solvents and lipids) before structural breakdown, which depends on the depth of penetration of solvents to the membranes. From the partitioning dynamics, it is observed that bilayers expand the area through the same rolling motion as described for detergent partitioning in Chapter 3. The energy loss due to the partitioning of organic solvents was balanced by the released heat and the increment of planar bilayer 2 ̆ 7 s curvature energy. Upon desorption of organic solvents, the bilayers shrink the area through the edges and by forming pores within the bilayers, concomitantly increase the contour length of bilayer edges, indicating self-healing is impossible for this system. In Chapter 5, we investigate the formation of sparsely-tethered bilayer lipid membranes (stBLMs) with vesicle hemifusion. In vesicle hemifusion, lipid vesicles in contact with a hydrophobic alkyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) deposit a lipid monolayer to the SAM surface, thus completing the bilayer. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy and Neutron reflectivity are used to probe the integrity of stBLMs in terms of their insulating and structural properties. Preparation conditions are screened for those that are optimal for stBLM formation. Concentrations of lipid vesicles, hydrophobicity of SAMs, the presence of calcium and high concentrations of salt are identified as the key parameters. We show that stBLMs can be formed with vesicles of different compositions. Vesicle hemifusion opens up a new route in preserving the chemical compositions of stBLMs and facilitating membrane proteins incorporation. In Chapter 6, we visualize the hemifusion pathway of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with planar hydrophobic surfaces at the single vesicle level with fluorescence video microscopy. When a GUV hemifuses to a surface, its outer leaflet breaks apart and remains connected to the surface presumably through a hemifusion diaphragm. Lipids from the outer leaflet are transferred to the surface as a lipid monolayer that expands radially outward from the hemifusion diaphragm, thereby forming the loosely <b>packed</b> <b>outer</b> hemifusion zone. The tension of the outer leaflet rises as lipids are transported to the outer hemifusion zone until it is large enough to rupture the GUV. Therefore, a pore forms near the hemifusion diaphragm through which the water encapsulated within the GUV is expelled. Additionally, lipids ipped from the inner to outer leaflet via the pore and are transferred to the surface. The hemifusion of lipids from both leaflets to the surface leads to the formation of the inner hemifusion zone densely packed with lipids. The inner and outer hemifusion zones expand radially as concentric discs with a rate of about 1000 m 2 =s, suggesting the expansion is driven by surface hydrophobicity. The spreading dynamics of the lipid monolayer is consistent with a model where the energy dissipated by friction between the monolayer and the surface is equal to the difference of surface energy when the surface is covered by a lipid monolayer. The mechanism revealed in this work provides insights into membrane reorganization and improves the understanding of vesicle-surface interactions. The tethering of membranes is a common process regulating membrane fusion throughout the secretory pathway. The Prof. Linstedt laboratory at the CMU Department of Biological Sciences has been focusing on the elucidation of the mechanism of Golgi membrane tethers, GRASP (Golgi Reassembly And Stacking Proteins), which are essential for the formation of the characteristic ribbon structure of the Golgi apparatus. Typically, such work involves in vivo expression of these proteins which tracks how specific mutations affect organelle morphology. However, it remains unclear in such investigations, whether a certain active protein is sufficient to trigger the formation of the characteristic structure or if other factors, for example auxiliary proteins, are involved. Therefore, in Chapter 7, we develop an in vitro assay employing stBLMs and lipid vesicles to examine the functionality of GRASP in membrane tethering. Membrane-bound GRASP on opposing membranes dimerizes and tethers fluorescently-labeled vesicles to stBLMs. The fluorescence intensity of images taken at stBLM surfaces is used to quantify the tethering activity. Both wild type and mutant proteins were studied to shed light on the molecular mechanism of tethering. We show that the GRASP domain is sufficient and necessary for membrane tethering. In addition, the tethering capability of GRASP is impaired when the internal ligands and the binding pockets participating in dimerization are deleted and mutated. Membrane anchors, sizes of vesicles and membrane compositions are explored for their influence on the outcomes of the assay. Furthermore, preliminary analysis from neutron reflectivity measurements shows that both the internal ligands and binding pockets are exposed instead of buried toward the membrane surface. In summary, we establish a functional assay for studying GRASP activity in vitro. This assay may also be used for studies of similar supramolecular structure formation processes in molecular biology...|$|R
