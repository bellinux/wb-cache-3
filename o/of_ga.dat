5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope <b>of</b> <b>GA,</b> classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom <b>of</b> <b>GA,</b> {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E
5|$|GA is {{regulated}} by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing, and {{the objective is to}} promote high standards of safety. At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies, and gliding is in transition from a self-regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA. Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted. The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector, and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> public transport operations, and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market. The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome-related environmental issues which, particularly regarding noise, are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA.|$|E
40|$|Graphene aerogels (GAs) have {{attracted}} extensive interest in diverse fields, owing to their ultrahigh surface area, low density and decent electrical conductivity. However, the undesirable thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>GAs</b> may limit their applications in energy storage devices. Here, we report a facile hydrothermal method to modulate both the electrical and thermal properties <b>of</b> <b>GAs</b> by including bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2). It {{was found that}} MoS 2 can help {{to reduce the size}} of graphene sheets and improve their dispersion, leading to the uniform porous micro-structure <b>of</b> <b>GAs.</b> The electrical measurement showed that the electrical conductivity <b>of</b> <b>GAs</b> could be decreased by 87 % by adding 0. 132 vol % of MoS 2. On the contrary, the thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>GAs</b> could be increased by ~ 51 % by including 0. 2 vol % of MoS 2. The quantitative investigation demonstrated that the effective medium theories (EMTs) could be applied to predict the thermal conductivity <b>of</b> composite <b>GAs.</b> Our findings indicated that the electrical and thermal properties <b>of</b> <b>GAs</b> can be tuned for the applications in various fields...|$|R

5|$|Of the 21,000 civil {{aircraft}} {{registered in the}} UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes Â£1.4 billion to the UK economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{product of}} growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas 6) {{is known to}} be {{synthesized}} by growth-arrested cells. In this study, we found that several rat tissues including platelets contain Gas 6 and activation of the platelets with thrombin provoked the release <b>of</b> <b>Gas</b> 6. ADP and collagen, which as well as thrombin stimulated release of ATP from platelets, also enhanced the release <b>of</b> <b>Gas</b> 6, suggesting that the mechanism of its release was similar to that of ATP release.

5|$|Within this {{framework}} certain sectors <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors {{that are not}} included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the British Parachute Association, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association UK, the British Gliding Association, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is self-regulated. The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang gliding and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.|$|E

For the purposes of a strategic review <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) defined the scope <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> as [...] "a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations.|$|E

500|$|With an {{expanded}} infrastructure in place, GA became established {{after the war}} when manufacturers such as Cessna and Piper introduced light aircraft designed for the private market. The Cessna 172, developed from the late 1940s Cessna 170, was introduced in 1956, and became the world's best selling single-engine aeroplane. Single piston-engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the UK GA fleet. The development of the Rogallo wing in the 1950s fostered the development of hang-gliding during the 1960s and 1970s.

500|$|Flying {{schools are}} {{commercial}} businesses {{engaged in the}} training of pilots, both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>GA</b> activity, {{both in terms of}} hours flown and aircraft movements. The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60â70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70â80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector. The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent. The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots. The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give [...] "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours [...] "does not support such a gloomy outlook." [...] Of course, reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity.|$|E
