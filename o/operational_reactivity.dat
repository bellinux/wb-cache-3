50|$|Human factors {{contributed to}} the {{conditions}} {{that led to the}} disaster. These included operating the reactor at a low power level—less than 700 MW—a level documented in the run-down test programme, and operating with a small <b>operational</b> <b>reactivity</b> margin (ORM). The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} implications and design recommendations for {{a reduction of}} asymmetric information in order processing. In reference to a logistical aspect the order processing process is detailed analysed, in order to detect theoretical implications for an application to the order processing process within the principalagent- theory. In context with the functional organisation, argumentations for an existence of asymmetric information have been shown. On closer examination of specific areas such as, mental designs, routines of organisational members, the relevancy of the dimension time {{and the importance of}} IT, asymmetric information has been identified, which can cause different costs and <b>operational</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Design recommendations for situational reduction of asymmetric information within order processing have been developed. It has resulted, that on a theoretical level it is possible to minimize asymmetric informations and disadvantages through a process-like logistic concept, through the implementation of organisational learning and through alternative organisational concepts. In reference to the IT one exemplary design concept has been introduced in order to reduce asymmetric information and <b>operational</b> <b>reactivity.</b> (author's abstract) Series: Schriftenreihe des Instituts für Transportwirtschaft und Logistik - Logisti...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{respond to}} the {{sustainability}} challenge, future electric systems {{are expected to be}} essentially based on low carbon solutions and also to be more flexible in order to balance supply and demand with more variable renewables. Among the options to achieve these goals a higher integration of electricity and natural gas grids could be beneficial. The <b>operational</b> <b>reactivity</b> of gas power plants could help balance the intermittency of solar and wind. Conversely, in a power to gas mode, excess electricity could be stored as hydrogen in the gas grid or even converted to synthetic methane using captured carbon dioxide. In this study we will focus on the condition of such an interaction for the future French power system by 2050. Using a LP framework to model the electricity and gas supply/demand problem, we will discuss investment and operational decisions (at an hourly resolution) for representative days and seasons...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{chemical}} industry {{relies heavily on}} homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Understanding the <b>operational</b> mode, or <b>reactivity,</b> of these catalysts is crucial for improved developments and enhanced performance. As a result, various spectroscopic techniques are inevitably used to characterize and interrogate the mechanistic details of the catalytic cycle. Where paramagnetic centres are involved, ranging from transition metal ions to defects and radicals, EPR spectroscopy is without doubt the technique of choice. In this review we will demonstrate the wealth and breadth of {{information that can be}} gleaned from this technique, in the characterization of homogenous and heterogeneous systems of catalytic importance, whilst illustrating the advantages that modern high-field and pulsed EPR methodologies can offer...|$|R
