2500|$|Dendritic spikes most {{commonly}} propagate backwards from the soma to distal dendritic branches. [...] Backward propagation serves {{a number of}} functions in the neuron. These functions vary based on the neuronal cell types. In general, backwards propagation serves to communicate <b>output</b> <b>information</b> to the post synaptic membrane. In many neurotransmitter releasing neurons, backward propagation of dendritic spikes signals the release of neurotransmitters. For example, Mitral cells seem to serve both as projection neurons and as local interneurons. If the axonal output of mitral cell is shut down by soma inhibition, local dendritic action potential causes the mitral cell to release neurotransmitters into the environment. Backward propagation of dendritic spikes has been demonstrated in various neuronal types in the brain but has rarely been studied outside of the brain. Other than neurons in the brain, dendritic spikes have been observed in the neurons of the spinal cord.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{cortical}} {{networks have}} the capacity to receive feedback from their own <b>output</b> <b>information</b> structures. This form of local feedback continuously cycles part of the networks output structures as its next input information structure. Since the output structure must represent the information message derived from the input structure, each consecutive cycle that is fed-back will represent the output structure the network just generated. As the network of mechanisms cannot recognize the information message, but only the input information structure, the network is unaware that it is representing its own previous outputs. The neural mechanisms are merely completing their instructional tasks and outputting any recognizable information structures. Orpwood proposes that these local networks come into an attractor state that consistently outputs exactly the same information structure as the input structure. Instead of only representing the information message derived from the input structure, the network will now represent its own output and thereby its own information message. As the input structures are fed-back, the network identifies the previous information structure as being a previous representation of the information message. As Orpwood states, ...|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of information-theoretic method is {{proposed}} to improve prediction performance in supervised learning. The method has two main technical features.

In the information acquisition phase, the autoencoder tries to acquire as much information content on input patterns as possible. In the information use phase, information obtained in the acquisition phase is used to train supervised learning. The method is a simplified version of actual information maximization and directly deals with the outputs from neurons. The method {{was applied to the}} three data sets, namely, Iris, bankruptcy, and rebel participation data sets.
