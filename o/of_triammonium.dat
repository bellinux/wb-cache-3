Comment In order to synthesize silicate-analogous framework structures built up from PN 4 tetrahedra (Schnick, Horstmann & H~iser, 1996) with a defined partial substi-tution of nitrogen by oxygen, we have started a system-atic investigation of soluble P-O-N compounds (Stock & Schnick, 1996) and have now isolated the title com-pound, (I).

Compared with conventional route using ammonium bicarbonate or aqueous ammonia as neutralizer, the method has advantages of simple technology process, 100 % raw materials utilization ratio and totally zero emission during mass production；while {{the raw materials}} utilization ratio was only 22. 8 % and 48. 6 % for using ammonium bicarbonate or aqueous ammonia as neutralizer under the same conditions. Furthermore, the proposed green route to production <b>of</b> <b>triammonium</b> citrate will save at least 813. 3 kJ and 948. 4 kJ of energy for manufacturing each kilogram of product than using NH 4 HCO 3 and NH 3 ·H 2 O (25 %) as neutralizer, respectively...|$|E

The crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>triammonium</b> hydrogen disulphate has been determined by X-ray diffraction at - 90 degrees C and the variation in the characteristics of the hydrogen bond is discussed in comparison with that of the structures at - 110 degrees C and room temperature. It is concluded that the mechanics involving the proton migration in such systems is realised in terms of the variations in the hydrogen bond features with temperature...|$|E
