40|$|Cultural {{heritage}} {{connects the}} past with the future by forming {{an integral part of}} the identities of societies. Countries must create policies for ensuring that people benefit today and passing it on to future generations by protecting their cultural heritage. In this context, it seems that the policies carried out until the time we are inside are inadequate. In Turkey, many cultural objects have disappeared for a variety of reasons (natural, economic, urbanization, disaster, etc.) and still face this danger. With globalization, it has become necessary to increase access to cultural heritage beyond physical protection, to ensure participation and to evaluate practices from an international perspective. For these requirements, developing information and communication technologies are used. Today, it is possible to have knowledge about and interact with a cultural objects existing in any part of the world through works done with digital humanities approach. At this point, a conceptual model was created to increase the visibility and usage of Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute Manuscripts, The Hittite cuneiform tablets from Bogazköy, The Works of Ibn Sina in the Süleymaniye Manuscript Library, Evliya Çelebi's "Book of Travels" in the Topkapi Palace Museum Library and the Süleymaniye Manuscript Library, and The Old Assyrian Merchant Archives of Kültepe in Turkey registered in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme in digital environment. In this model, which is prepared with the approach of digital humanities, best practices in the literature applied in this field are taken as examples. Suggestions are made about how to use digital humanities tools to reveal the economic, social and cultural values of objects based on the model and to increase their accessibility and visibility. Despite the fact that in recent years a wide range of digitization works of cultural heritage seen in cultural memory institutions, it cannot be said that these works have reached its full purpose. The reason for this is that most of the digitized works are still not accessible to the users in the web environment. In fact, two of the five works have not been opened to Internet access since they have been digitized. The other three works are not yet digitized <b>on</b> <b>collection</b> <b>basis.</b> In addition, there are no studies to increase the visibility of these works in the world and thus to create aesthetic, historical and social values in the mind of humanity related to these heritage. Instead of these independent studies, a holistic approach is needed in which all sectors are involved. Turkey will not be able to benefit from its present rich heritage economically, socially and culturally enough, as long as technological developments, budgets devoted to the application of these developments over cultural heritage, and policies that play a role in shaping these developments are not met contemporary...|$|E

The two more urban national newspapers published 229 articles on human resources and health services in Uganda (on average over two articles per week), whereas the local more rural newspaper published only a single article on this issue in the 12 month period. The majority of articles described problems in the health service without discussing accountability. The question of accountability is raised in only 46 % of articles (106 articles). The responsibility of the government was discussed in 50 articles (21 %), and negligence, corruption and misbehaviour by individual health workers was reported in 56 articles (25 %). In the articles about corruption (n= 35), 60 % (21 articles) mention corruption by health workers and 40 % (14 articles) mention corruption by government officials. Six articles defended the situation of health workers in Uganda. The coverage of accountability in the Ugandan newspapers surveyed is insufficient to generate informed debate on what political actions need to be taken to improve the crisis in health care and services.

Propionibacterium freudenreichii is an Actinobacterium used in cheese technology (responsible for aroma and holes in Swiss cheese) and that has probiotic properties (bifidogenic and with anti-inflammatory properties in human and animal). 23 strains of Propionibacterium freudenreichii covering 18 different sequence types out of 46 (Dalmasso et al.

40|$|Abstract- The CBIR {{term has}} been widely used to {{describe}} the process of retrieving desired images from a large <b>collection</b> <b>on</b> the <b>basis</b> of features (such as color, texture and shape) that can be extracted from the images themselves. In this paper, we have proposed an image retrieval system on the basis of classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is implemented in MATLAB with the help of Gabor Filtered image features. In the proposed system, texture features are found by calculating the Standard Deviation of the Gabor Filtered image. A SVM classifier can be learned from training data of relevance images and irrelevance images marked by users. Using the classifier, the system can retrieve more images relevant to the query in the database efficiently. The proposed CBIR technique is implemented on a database having 1000 images spread across 11 categories and COIL image database having 1080 images spread across 15 categories. For each proposed CBIR technique 55 queries (5 per category) are fired on the database and net average precision and recall are computed. The results have shown performance improvement with higher precision and recall values, achieving crossover point as high as 89 % with SVM technique as compared to image retrieval using Gabor Magnitude without SVM technique where the maximum crossover point is approximately 79 %.
