5|$|Operationally, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center speculated whether Bertha was {{transitioning}} into a subtropical cyclone, due to {{its deep}} convection being located, at times, over 200miles (321.8km) from the center. However, the convection progressively returned to the center and by late on July30, Bertha re-intensified into a hurricane as the convection covered the center, about 415miles (667.8km) east <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> first formed. Early on July31, the hurricane briefly attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) before weakening and accelerated northeastward as the ridge of high pressure was slowly eroded. Bertha maintained hurricane status as it approached Atlantic Canada, and briefly reached winds of 80mph (129km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Sydney, Nova Scotia on August1 as a 70mph (113km/h) tropical storm. The storm was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while approaching Atlantic Canada, and lost all tropical characteristics shortly after moving ashore. The weakening extratropical remnants of Bertha turned northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and lost its identity shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} making beer is known as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E
5|$|The remnant low {{pressure}} area continued to the west-northwest, and on September 6 the system gradually produced deep convection. A surface circulation redeveloped in the northern portion of the remnants of Erin, and the system developed into a tropical depression again late on September 6 while located 365miles (585km) north-northwest <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> previously dissipated. The depression moved to the north-northeast, {{then turned to the}} north-northwest, and regained tropical storm status on September 7. Erin steadily intensified, and its convection and cloud pattern became much better organized on September 8. On September 9 Erin intensified into a hurricane while located 275miles (440km), and a 40mile (65km) wide eye developed. Erin quickly strengthened on September 9 to reach a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h)., however some sources claim that Erin may have been a little stronger.|$|E

5|$|US-59's first highway {{junction}} in Sequoyah County is with SH-141 west of Gans, {{where the}} latter highway reaches its western terminus. US-59 continues northward, crossing Wildhorse Mountain {{as well as}} Little Sallisaw Creek, just upstream <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> empties into Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The highway then enters the county seat of Sequoyah County, Sallisaw, where it has an interchange with Interstate 40 at Exit 308. North of the interstate, US-59 intersects US-64, turning east to follow the latter route into downtown Sallisaw. US-59 splits away to the north, becoming a two-lane highway. North of town, the highway serves as the western terminus of SH-101. US-59 then passes through unincorporated Brushy. North of Brushy, the highway winds through the Brushy Mountains. The road exits Sequoyah County north of this group of mountains.|$|E

5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E
5|$|On January23, the ITCZ spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} to {{the southwest}} of Diego Garcia, west of Helinda and east of Gretelle. The system quickly developed an organized central dense overcast, but failed to become a tropical cyclone {{due to the lack}} of a circulation in the region. Late on January24, the system developed into a tropical depression, by which time the Mauritius Meteorological Services had named it Iletta. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm, but further development halted on January25. Due to a nearby trough, the storm tracked to the southeast. Iletta resumed intensification on January26, quickly reaching peak 10winds of 100km/h (65mph); the JTWC meanwhile estimated peak 1minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened Iletta, and within 24hours the storm had decreased from peak intensity to tropical depression status. After the trough passed the storm, Iletta turned to the north under the influence of a ridge to the south, dissipating on January30 about 305km (190mi) east-southeast <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> initially formed.|$|E
5|$|The IMD issued {{warnings}} {{related to}} the cyclone that were distributed to the public by television, telegraph, news outlets, and other government departments. The All India Radio broadcast warnings beginning on November5, the day before landfall. Train service was disrupted throughout Andhra Pradesh, stranding thousands of travelers. India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation suspended operations during the storm. The storm caused local Diwali festivities to be canceled. It ultimately struck about 50km (30mi) north <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was expected, in a region farther away from state shelters. About 225,000families evacuated due to the storm. However, about 30% of the towns in the region lacked a storm shelter, and the existing shelters were generally in poor shape. Some residents avoided the shelters due to their state of disrepair, or stayed in their homes for fear they would be robbed. In addition, storm emergency plans enacted after a cyclone in 1977 that struck Andhra Pradesh had not been used since 1986. Roads and shelters built following a cyclone in 1990 fared the storm better than older structures.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak strength, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Hurricane Sergio {{to intensify}} further to reach winds of 120mph (195km/h). Shortly after peaking, the hurricane {{turned to the}} north and gradually weakened as wind shear from an upper-level trough to its northwest increased. By early on November 17, the low-cloud circulation became partially exposed {{on the west side of}} the deep convection, and it is estimated that Sergio weakened to a tropical storm later that day. A ridge to its north and northeast turned the storm to the northwest and later to the west as Sergio gradually weakened. Deep convection reformed near the center on November 18, resulting in a slight increase in winds, though vertical shear quickly weakened it again. Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to land, about 225miles (360km) southwest of Michoacán. Early on November 20 it degenerated into a tropical depression, and later that day Sergio dissipated about 360miles (580km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, or about 320miles (515km) west-northwest <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> originally formed. The remnants of Sergio continued westward for about a day before the minimal amount of convection diminished.|$|E
