5|$|After its {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was banned from {{operating}} {{an air force}} by the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles.</b> German re-armament began earnestly in the 1930s and was initially kept secret because it violated the treaty. The early development of military bombers was disguised as a development program for civilian transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles,</b> hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople there could afford a musical education at Bruno Heydrich's conservatory. This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.|$|E

5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles,</b> were ratified in 1921.|$|E

5|$|The {{terms of}} the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles,</b> signed on 21 June 1919, {{permitted}} Germany to retain a surface fleet of eight obsolete battleships. This amounted to three of the Deutschland-class battleships, Hannover, Schleswig-Holstein and Schlesien, {{as well as the}} five s.|$|E

5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war, Barkley supported bills implementing conscription and raising revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after {{the election of a}} more conservative Congress in 1918.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaties <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> brought an end to the Anglo-French War, Agamemnon {{returned}} from the West Indies to Chatham, where she was paid off and docked on 29 October 1783 for repairs and to have her copper sheathing replaced. She came out of dock on 4 June 1784, and was subsequently laid up in ordinary.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Macmillan went to Zürich in May 1919 as a {{delegate}} to the International Congress of Women.

5|$|As {{a result}} of their defeat in World War I and the {{resulting}} Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles,</b> Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine, Northern Schleswig and Memel. The Saarland temporarily became a protectorate of France under the condition that its residents would later decide by referendum which country to join and Poland became a separate nation and was given access to the sea by the creation of the Polish Corridor, which separated Prussia from the rest of Germany, while Danzig was made a free city.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an {{independent}} state, {{it was in}} reality a province of France. Its rulers spent {{much of their time}} at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> was greater than that of their own country.|$|E
5|$|Following Germany's {{defeat in}} World War I, hyperinflation, mass unemployment, poverty, crime and civil unrest plagued the country. During that time, Heiden {{served in a}} Freikorps unit. Also in 1919, a small right-wing {{political}} party known as the German Workers' Party (DAP) was created and seated in Munich. In 1920, it {{changed its name to}} the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP). It rejected the terms of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> and advocated antisemitism and anti-Bolshevism.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, {{the regime}} {{withdrew from the}} Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Versailles</b> and {{introduced}} the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.

5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna.

Maria Theresa kept up a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
