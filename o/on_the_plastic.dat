25|$|Some of the company's first promotional {{vehicles}} appeared {{about the}} same time as the museum pieces, and though they were not brass era, they were yet molded in plastic. One model was the Audi 100 sedan, the real car being one of the first Audis to be exported to the United States around 1969. This model was slightly larger than 1:43 scale, in a silver box with black lettering. The car was well detailed in styrene plastic, especially the front grille and also the floorpan and engine features <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> chassis. This model may have been one of the first promotionals offered by Cursor, and perhaps somewhat rare, because it is not mentioned in Force's (1990) book.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plastic,</b> to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E
25|$|The modern game of Stratego, {{with its}} Napoleonic imagery, was {{originally}} {{manufactured in the}} Netherlands. Pieces were originally made of printed cardboard and inserted in metal clip stands. After World War II, painted wood pieces became standard. Starting in the early 1960s all versions switched to plastic pieces. The change from wood to plastic was made for economical reasons, {{as was the case}} with many products during that period, but with Stratego the change also served a structural function: Unlike the wooden pieces, the plastic pieces were designed with a small base. The wooden pieces had none, often resulting in pieces tipping over. This was disastrous for that player, since it often immediately revealed the piece's rank, as well as unleashing a literal domino effect by having a falling piece knock over other pieces. European versions introduced cylindrical castle-shaped pieces that proved to be popular. American editions later introduced new rectangular pieces with a more stable base and colorful stickers, not images directly imprinted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E

25|$|Boro's defense {{remained}} solid when Wigan {{came to the}} Riverside Stadium, {{but continued}} to struggle in attack. A line-up unchanged from the midweek FA Cup draw with West Ham was forced into a change midway through the first half. Summer departure Lee Cattermole's strong-but-fair challenge on Didier Digard forced the midfielder off with injuries to both legs that would likely rule him out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Neither side could muster enough chances for a goal and the game ended 0â€“0. Middlesbrough's dire run stretched to fourteen games without a win, with only one goal in nine games. A letter from the club's Safety Officer, Sue Watson, was handed out to supporters in block 53A. It was intended to ask supporters to refrain from constantly standing and to stop banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> sheeting on the back of the stand, but its bad wording caused much anger among fans who interpreted it as asking them to sit down and be quiet. The club was forced to apologise to the fans and clarify the confusion.|$|E
25|$|Most five-piece kits, at {{more than}} entry level, also have one or more effects cymbals. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats and one crash {{configuration}} requires more stands {{in addition to the}} standard drum hardware packs. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or even no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and also the bass drum pedal he/she prefers. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two cymbal stands, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard cymbal pack, a stool and a pair of 5A drum sticks. In the 2010s, digital kits are often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash cymbal triggers and one ride cymbal trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> or rubber heads. The trigger-pads are wired up to a synth module or sampler.|$|E

[...] The six men / six women jury took less than seven hours to convict Littlejohn of murdering Imette St. Guillen and found him guilty of first degree murder. One juror, Marian Mallero, said: [...] "The DNA said a lot about it. They gave us evidence and it was obvious"; and, [...] "He's guilty, that's all I'm going to say."

2500|$|Darryl Littlejohn, {{one of two}} bouncers at The Falls where St. Guillen {{was seen}} the night she was murdered, was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, and {{unlawful}} imprisonment.

Littlejohn was asked to escort St. Guillen out of The Falls just before closing, and was later seen talking to the young woman {{in front of the}} bar.

Carpet fibers found in Littlejohn's home were a match to fibers discovered on the adhesive tape wrapping St. Guillen's face.

60|$|Another {{very simple}} form of ornamentation, reappearing {{everywhere}} {{all the world}} over on primitive bowls and vases, is the rope pattern, a line or string-course over the whole surface or {{near the mouth of}} the vessel. Many of the indented patterns on early British pottery have been produced, as Sir Daniel Wilson has pointed out, by the close impress of twisted cord on the wet clay. Sometimes these cords seem to have been originally left on the clay in the process of baking, and used as a mould; at other times they may have been employed afterwards as handles, as is still done in the case of some South African pots: and, when the rope handle wore off, the pattern made by its indentation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plastic</b> material before sun-baking would still remain as pure ornament. Probably the very common idea of string-course ornamentation just below the mouth or top of vases and bowls has its origin in this early and almost universal practice.|$|E
