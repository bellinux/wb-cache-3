40|$|This report {{describes}} the principal activities of a technical review team formed to address National Full Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC) blade repair problems. In particular, {{the problem of}} lack of good adhesive bonding of the composite <b>overwrap</b> <b>to</b> the Hyduliginum wood blade material was studied extensively. Description of action plans and technical elements of the plans are provided. Results of experiments designed to optimize the bonding process and bonding strengths obtained on a full scale blade using a two-step cure process with adhesive primers are presented. Consensus recommendations developed by the review team {{in conjunction with the}} NASA Ames Fan Blade Repair Project Team are provided along with lessons learned on this program. Implementation of recommendations resulted in achieving good adhesive bonds between the composite materials and wooden blades, thereby providing assurance that the repaired fan blades will meet or exceed operational life requirements...|$|E
40|$|Many aging {{composite}} overwrapped {{pressure vessels}} (COPVs), {{being used by}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are currently under evaluation to better quantify their reliability and clarify their likelihood of failure due to stress rupture and age-dependent issues. As a result, some test and analysis programs have been successfully accomplished and other related programs are still in progress at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) and other NASA centers, with assistance from the commercial sector. To support this effort, a group of Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) experts was assembled to provide NDE competence for pretest evaluation of test articles and for application of NDE technology to real-time testing. Techniques were required to provide assurance that the test article had adequate structural integrity and manufacturing consistency to be considered acceptable for testing and these techniques were successfully applied. Destructive testing is also being accomplished to better understand the physical and chemical property changes associated with progression toward "stress rupture" (SR) failure, and it is being associated with NDE response, so it can potentially be used to help with life prediction. Destructive work also includes the evaluation of residual stresses during dissection of the overwrap, laboratory evaluation of specimens extracted from the <b>overwrap</b> <b>to</b> evaluate physical property changes, and quantitative microscopy to inform the theoretical micromechanics...|$|E

The objective {{was to determine the}} performance and ranking of these <b>overwraps</b> <b>to</b> ensure that sustained loads would not be a problem during their 30 -yr life in space. Tests were conducted at high stress levels for short time periods on subscale composite bottles.

50|$|It is safe {{to freeze}} chicken {{directly}} in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended <b>to</b> <b>overwrap</b> these packages. It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is. If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, {{but it is still}} recommended <b>to</b> <b>overwrap</b> or rewrap it. Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices won't drip onto other foods. If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly.|$|R
40|$|Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are often}} used for storing {{pressurant}} gases onboard spacecraft. Kevlar (DuPont), glass, carbon and other more recent fibers have all been used as <b>overwraps.</b> Due <b>to</b> the fact that <b>overwraps</b> are subjected <b>to</b> sustained loads {{for an extended period}} during a mission, stress rupture failure is a major concern. It is therefore important to ascertain the reliability of these vessels by analysis, since the testing of each flight design cannot be completed on a practical time scale. The present paper examines specifically a Weibull statistics based stress rupture model and considers the various uncertainties associated with the model parameters. The paper also examines several reliability estimate measures that would be of use for the purpose of recertification and for qualifying flight worthiness of these vessels. Specifically, deterministic values for a point estimate, mean estimate and 90 / 95 percent confidence estimates of the reliability are all examined for a typical flight quality vessel under constant stress. The mean and the 90 / 95 percent confidence estimates are computed using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques by assuming distribution statistics of model parameters based also on simulation and on the available data, especially the sample sizes represented in the data. The data for the stress rupture model are obtained from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) stress rupture testing program, carried out for the past 35 years. Deterministic as well as probabilistic sensitivities are examined...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} trend to repair corroded or eroded pipelines, conveying oil, gas or water, by using fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. This relatively new repair technique involves wrapping the corroded part of the pipeline with a so-called FRP overwrap. FRP materials are lightweight, have high relative strength and do not corrode, making them an effective repair solution. The viability of this repair technique has been proved by the numerous research programs which have been performed. However, most of the literature regarding the design of FRP overwraps does only consider a static internal pressure. In this thesis, the behaviour of steel pipelines, repaired with FRP <b>overwraps,</b> subjected <b>to</b> water hammer conditions, has been investigated. Water hammer is the occurrence of pressure waves in the conveyed liquid, due to abrupt changes to steady flow conditions, for example the rapid closure of a valve. An approximate dynamic model, describing the radial vibration of steel pipes with a FRP <b>overwrap,</b> due <b>to</b> water hammer conditions, has been derived. The model is based on the theory of thin-walled cylinders, and the laminate stiffness matrix for a FRP laminate. In order to take the steel pipe into account, the laminate stiffness matrix was modified. Basic water hammer theory was used to find the magnitude and velocity of the water hammer-induced pressure wave. These properties defined the exciting load in the dynamic analysis of the repaired pipe wall. The derived governing equation was solved analytically by applying boundary conditions and utilising the properties of Fourier series. This resulted in series expressions for the radial deflection and the pipe wall stresses, as functions of the distance from the valve, and time since valve closure. The model was also implemented on representative examples, with two different FRP materials; E-Glass/Epoxy and T 300 / 5208 Carbon/Epoxy, and the influence of the thickness of the FRP overwrap was investigated. For both these materials, the model predicted the maximum radial deflection, due to the water hammer, to decrease if the overwrap was thin, and increase if the overwrap was thick. The reason was found to be that the natural frequency of the pipe is significantly altered when a thick FRP overwrap is applied, because of its low density, compared to the steel pipe. As the FRP overwrap gets thicker, the water hammer-induced vibration approaches a state of resonance, increasing the amplitude of the vibration. The rate, at which the amplitude increases, with respect to the thickness of the overwrap, will depend on the density and stiffness of the FRP material. The increased amplitude nevertheless causes an increased maximum radial deflection, and thereby increased stresses. During the design of a FRP overwrap for a pipe which is susceptible to water hammer conditions, it will therefore be important to ensure that the changed natural frequency does not lead to unacceptable stresses...|$|R
40|$|Reported {{mechanical}} properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at the nanoscale suggest their potential to enable significantly lighter structures {{of interest for}} space applications. However, their utility depends on the retention of these properties in bulk material formats that permit practical fabrication of large structures. This presentation summarizes recent progress made to produce carbon nanotube composites with specific tensile properties that begin to rival those of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. CNT content in these nanocomposites was greater than 70 % by weight. Tested nanocomposite specimens were fabricated from kilometers or tens of square meters of CNT, depending on the starting material format. Processing methods to yield these results, and characterization and testing to evaluate the performance of these composites will be discussed. The final objective is the demonstration of a CNT composite <b>overwrapped</b> pressure vessel <b>to</b> be flight tested in the Fall of 2016...|$|R
40|$|Recent cut damages {{sustained}} on crewmember gloves during {{extravehicular activity}} (ISS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) {{have been caused}} by contact with sharp edges or a pinch point according to analysis of the damages. One potential source are protruding sharp edged crater lips from micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts on metallic handrails along EVA translation paths. A number of hypervelocity impact tests were performed on ISS handrails, and found that mm-sized projectiles were capable of inducing crater lip heights two orders of magnitude above the minimum value for glove abrasion concerns. Two techniques were evaluated for mitigating the cut glove hazard of MMOD impacts on ISS handrails: flexible <b>overwraps</b> which act <b>to</b> limit contact between crewmember gloves and impact sites, and; alternate materials which form less hazardous impact crater profiles. In parallel with redesign efforts to increase the cut resilience of EMU gloves, the modifications to ISS handrails evaluated in this study provide the means to significantly reduce cut glove risk from MMOD impact crater...|$|R
40|$|The DIII-D tokamak {{has been}} {{operated}} since June 1995 with constrained ohmic heating capability as {{imposed by the}} abandonment of half of it`s solenoid system due to a cooling water leak. The solenoid is comprised of A and B windings with separate multiple power leads to each. The cooling water leak occurred in {{the lead of the}} B winding. This leak occurred in a remote area under the DIII-D vessel and is believed to be caused by magnetic forces developing cyclic bending loads on the conductor. Visual inspection of the lead using flexible bore scopes indicated that the structural fiberglass <b>overwrap</b> intended <b>to</b> band the supply and return leads into a primary-force canceling group had failed allowing individual conductors to become inadequately supported against bending loads. The overwrap failed as a result of poor epoxy encapsulation of the lead which was manufactured in 1978. Inspection of the A lead confirmed no overwrap failure and that the vacuum encapsulation of the A lead was proper and to specification. In order to continue operations, it was decided to abandon the B winding of the solenoid and operate under reduced (5 V-sec) capability. An in-situ repair approach was mandated by the extensive and lengthy effort required to disassemble, repair, and reassemble the tokamak. Access from outside the tokamak was severely limited. A plan to repair the damaged lead was developed and implemented over a 10 month period. This paper describes the repair of the solenoid lead. A VCR video tape of these remote installation efforts has been assembled and will be shown...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the health}} {{assessment}} of flight spare 40 in diameter Kevlar composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) SN 002 and SN 027 an eddy current characterization of the composite and liner thickness change during pressurization was requested under WSTF-TP- 1085 - 07. A, "Space Shuttle Orbiter Main Propulsion System P/N MC 282 - 0082 - 0101 S/N 002 and Orbital Maneuvering System P/N MC 282 - 0082 - 001 S/N 027 COPV Health Assessment. " The through the thickness strains have been determined {{to be an important}} parameter in the analysis of the reliability and likelihood of stress rupture failure. Eddy current techniques provide a means to measure these thicknesses changes based upon the change in impedance of an eddy current sensor mounted on the exterior of the vessel. Careful probe and technique design have resulted in the capability to independently measure the liner and <b>overwrap</b> thickness changes <b>to</b> better than +/- 0. 0005 in. at each sensor location.

40|$|During post-flight {{processing}} of STS- 116, damage to crewmember Robert Curbeam's Phase VI Glove Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment was discovered. This damage consisted of: loss of RTV- 157 palm pads on the thumb {{area on the}} right glove, a 0. 75 inch cut in the Vectran adjacent to the seam and thumb pad (single event cut), constituting the worst glove damage ever recorded for the U. S. space program. The underlying bladder and restraint were found not be damaged by this event. Evaluation of glove damage found that the outer Vectran fibers were sliced {{as a result of}} contact with a sharp edge or pinch point rather than general wear or abrasion (commonly observed on the RTV pads). Damage to gloves was also noted on STS- 118 and STS- 120. One potential source of EMU glove damages are sharp crater lips on external handrails, generated by micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts. In this paper, the results of a hypervelocity impact (HVI) test program on representative and actual ISS handrails are presented. These tests were performed in order to characterize impact damage profiles on ISS handrails and evaluate alternatives for limiting risk to future missions. It was determined that both penetrating and non-penetrating MMOD impacts on aluminum and steel ISS handrails are capable of generating protruding crater profiles which exceed the heights required for EMU glove abrasion risk by an order of magnitude. Testing demonstrated that flexible <b>overwraps</b> attached <b>to</b> the outside of existing handrails are capable of limiting contact between hazardous crater formations and crewmember gloves during extravehicular activity (EVA). Additionally, replacing metallic handrails with high strength, low ductility, fiber reinforced composite materials would limit the formation of protruding crater lips on new ISS modules...|$|R
40|$|A new {{oxidizer}} {{tank assembly}} {{is required for}} a new commercial satellite. Due to its high L over D ratio, a state-of-the-art tank shell, with its cylinder section reinforced with composite <b>overwrap,</b> was designed <b>to</b> meet the tank requirements. This tank was designed to accommodate low fill fraction horizontal ground handling with unlimited upright-to-horizontal cycles, and to provide gas-free expulsion of oxidizer propellant in low or zero-g environment. A lightweight, high performance, and highly reliable Propellant Management Device (PMD) {{was developed to meet}} this requirement. To minimize risk, the heritage approach was utilized to design and manufacture the tank shell and the PMD. The tank shell construction is entirely based on existing, qualifed shell designs with flight heritage. Likewise, the PMD design utilized all PMD elements previously designed and qualifed for similar missions. Stress and fracture mechanics analyses were conducted to design the tank shell. Finite element modeling technique was utilized to assist detail designs. A structural analysis was conducted to validate the PMD, and a PMD performance analysis was conducted to design and validate the PMD. A complete qualification test program is required to qualify this tank. The qualification testing program is not yet complete at the time of publication...|$|R
40|$|Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are used}} to store gases under high {{pressure}} onboard spacecraft. These are used {{for a variety of}} purposes such as propelling liquid fuel etc, Kevlar, glass, Carbon and other more recent fibers have all been in use <b>to</b> <b>overwrap</b> the vessels. COPVs usually have a thin metallic liner with the primary purpose of containing the gases and prevent any leakage. The liner is overwrapped with filament wound composite such as Kevlar, Carbon or Glass fiber. Although the liner is required to perform in the leak before break mode making the failure a relatively benign mode, the overwrap can fail catastrophically under sustained load due to stress rupture. It is this failure mode that is of major concern as the stored energy of such vessels is often great enough ta cause loss of crew and vehicle. The present paper addresses some of the reliability concerns associated specifically with Kevlar Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels. The primary focus of the paper is on how reliability of COPV's are established for the purpose of deciding in general their flight worthiness and continued use. Analytical models based on existing design data will be presented showing how to achieve the required reliability metric {{to the end of a}} specific period of performance. Uncertainties in the design parameters and how they affect reliability and confidence intervals will be addressed as well. Some trade studies showing how reliability changes with time during a program period will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) {{are often}} used for storing {{pressurant}} gases on board spacecraft when mass saving is a prime requirement. Substantial weight savings can be achieved compared to all metallic pressure vessels. For example, on the Space Shuttle, replacement of all metallic pressure vessels with Kevlar COPVs resulted in a weight savings of about 30 %. Mass critical space applications such as the Aries and Orion vehicles are currently being planned to use as many COPVs as possible in place of all-metallic pressure vessels to minimize the overall mass of the vehicle. Due {{to the fact that}} <b>overwraps</b> are subjected <b>to</b> sustained loads during long periods of a mission, stress rupture failure is a major concern. It is, therefore, important to ascertain the reliability of these vessels by analysis, since it is practically impossible to show by experimental testing the reliability of flight quality vessels. Also, it is a common practice to set aside flight quality vessels as “fleet leaders ” in a test program where these vessels are subjected to slightly accelerated operating conditions so that they lead the actual flight vessels both in time and load. The intention of fleet leaders is to provide advanced warning if there is a serious design flaw in the vessels so that a major disaster in the flight vessels can be averted with advance warning. On the other hand, the accelerating conditions must be not so severe as to be prone to false alarms. The primary focus of the present paper is to provide an analytical basis for designing a viable fleet leader program for Carbon COPVs. The analysis is based on a stress rupture behavior model incorporating Weibull statistics and power-law sensitivity of life to fiber stress level. Nomenclatur...|$|R
40|$|White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) was {{requested}} to perform ambient temperature hydrostatic pressurization testing of a Space Transportation System (STS) 40 -in. Kevlar Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel (COPV). The 40 -in. vessel {{was of the}} same design and approximate age as the STS Main Propulsion System (MPS) and Orbiter Maneuvering System (OMS) vessels. The NASA Engineering Safety Center (NESC) assembled a team of experts and conducted an assessment that involved a review of national Kevlar COPY data. During the review, the STS COPVs {{were found to be}} beyond their original certification of ten years. The team observed that the likelihood of STS COPV Stress rupture, a catastrophic burst before leak failure mode, was greater than previously believed. Consequently, a detailed assessment of remaining stress rupture life became necessary. Prior to STS- 114, a certification deviation was written for two flights of OV- 103 (Discovery) and OV- 104 (Atlantis) per rationale that was based on an extensive review of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, COPV data, and revisions to the STS COPV stress levels. In order to obtain flight rationale to extend the certification deviation {{through the end of the}} Program, the Orbiter Project Office has directed an interagency COPV team to conduct further testing and analysis to investigate conservatism in the stress rupture model and evaluate material age degradation. Additional analysis of stress rupture life requires understanding the fiber stresses including stress that occurs due to thru-wall composite compression in COPV components. Data must be obtained at both zero gauge pressure (pre-stress) and at the component operating pressure so that this phenomenon can be properly evaluated. The zero gauge pressure stresses are predominantly a result of the autofrettage process used during vessel manufacture. Determining these pre-stresses and the constitutive behavior of the overwrap at pressure will provide necessary information to better predict the remaining life of the STS COPVs. The primary test objective is obtaining data to verify the hypothesis of a radially oriented thru-thickness stress-riser in the COPV composite whose magnitude is a function of the applied pressure and the load history. The anticipated load dependent response follows from the constitutive behavior of the composite <b>overwrap</b> so data <b>to</b> quantify its nonlinear and time dependent response will be sought. The objective of the Fiber Braggs Gratings (FBGs) were to advance the state-of-the-art by developing techniques using FBG sensors that are capable of assessing stress-rupture degradation in Kevlar COPVs in a health monitoring mode (1). Moreover, they sought to answer questions of how embedded sensors affect overall integrity of the structure. And lastly, they sought to provide an important link in the overall stress rupture study that will help close the loop on the COPV fabrication process. NDE inspection methods will be used from start to finish and FBG will be an integral link within the overall chain...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the factors {{relating}} to insect infestation of produce manufactured at the Cadbury Schweppes' Tasmanian confectionery plant, in order to determine means by which the incidence of product infestation could be minimized. Analysis of the company's infestation-related consumer complaint databases revealed that: assortments (boxed-chocolates) were most likely to be infested; the geographic distribution of complaints was temperature-dependent; 'old' stock and/or produce manufactured during spring was most likely to be infested; infested goods were more likely to be purchased from smaller retail outlets and; the costs associated with infestation were substantial. Phycitine moths were almost exclusively responsible for infestation, and it was estimated that most cases of infestation occurred post-packaging, most likely while stock was in the hands of independent wholesalers and retailers. A small proportion of infestation probably originated at the Hobart plant, caused by a resident population of the almond moth, Ephestia cautella (Walker). This population was traditionally suppressed by the blanket application of synergised pyrethrins throughout the factory, although, an extensive pheromone trapping program indicated that the spraying of pyrethrins affected neither the distribution of E. cautella, nor the capture rate, and the distribution of E. cautella within the factory was primary dependent upon hygiene conditions. A single room within the factory was identified as the primary source of migratory E. cautella, and a control strategy, based on the mass trapping technique, successfully reduced E. cautella numbers in this room to negligible levels. The influence of trap design on E. cautella catch was also evaluated. Aspects of phycitine ecology with regard to the post-packaging infestation of produce were examined, and it was found that both adult and juvenile phycitines responded positively to odours escaping from chocolate boxes. The integrity of packaging significantly influenced the likelihood, and extent, of infestation, while the polyvinyl chloride film used <b>to</b> <b>overwrap</b> assortment boxes was found to be readily penetrated by several stored-product insect species. An alternative polypropylene film offered significantly improved insect barrier properties. A number of measures aimed at minimizing both pre- and post- packaging infestation were recommended. At the factory, it was recommended that an insect pest control strategy relying on advanced insect detection methods and improved sanitary procedures, supported by an appropriate management structure, be adopted in preference to the current chemical-based strategy. With regard to post-packaging infestation, it was recommended that wholesalers and retailers be educated about the dangers that stored-product insects pose to goods, and methods through which insect apparency can be minimized. It was also recommended that the utility of packaging materials and/or technologies that completely retained odours and provide superior insect barrier qualities be investigated. Also, that quality control procedures be implemented to monitor the integrity of product packaging...|$|R
