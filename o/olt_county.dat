25|$|Born in Bucharest on December 28 or 29, 1840, {{his father}} was Lazăr (Lazaros) Kalenderoglu (or Calenderoglu). Of {{possible}} Smyrniote origin, the family functioned {{as one of the}} largest banking and exporting institutions in Wallachia, and then in the United Principalities. Lazăr had risen into the ranks of Wallachia's boyar nobility: joining the Bucharest local government in 1838, 1844, and 1847, he was awarded the title of pitar. His son would later falsely claim that the Kalenderoglus played a part in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, although Lazăr is known to have held relevant positions in the National Party in 1857, briefly serving as its chairman alongside Constantin A. Crețulescu. The last-ever tenant and tax collector of Predeal customs, Kalenderoglu had his estate in <b>Olt</b> <b>County,</b> outside Colonești, reduced during the land reform of 1864. Another of his estates, at Bălcești, was repurchased by the Bălcescu boyars. However, he still left Ioan the manor of Schitu-Greci.|$|E

2500|$|Ceaușescu {{was born}} in the small village of Scornicești, <b>Olt</b> <b>County,</b> on 26 January 1918, being one of the nine {{children}} of a poor peasant family (see Ceaușescu family). His father, Andruță, owned [...] of agricultural land and a few sheep, and he supplemented his large family's income through tailoring. Nicolae studied at the village school until at the age of 11, when he ran away from his extremely religious, abusive and strict father to Bucharest.

2500|$|Buicescul was {{probably}} a native of Buicești, the family's demesne {{in what is now}} <b>Olt</b> <b>County.</b> He is known to have had at least one sister, from whom he had a favorite nephew, Tudor. Their father was Ioan Buicescul; their mother, Maria (or Mara), was a relative—either niece or cousin—of Aga Matei Basarab. In his overview of Wallachian politics, the Melkite traveler Paul of Aleppo notes that Buicescul was, or was perceived to be, an ibn fellah, translated as [...] "son of peasants" [...] or [...] "son of nobody". As noted by genealogist Constantin Gane, the Buicesculs were commoners of obscure origins. The first recorded member of the family was Diicul's paternal grandfather, the Jupân Mitre. Also according to Gane, Buicești was actually inherited from Maria, having been an estate of the more ancient Craiovești family, from which both Diicul and Aga Matei descended. This account is also backed by scholar I. Ionașcu.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to develop biomass {{equations}} for young black locust trees from plantations and coppices established in South-West Romania. A destructive method was used to develop allometric biomass equations and to assess the carbon content of the individual tree and its biomass components. 418 black locust young trees (1 - 4 years old) from 27 plots established in plantations and coppices growing on sandy soils in Dolj and <b>Olt</b> <b>counties</b> were sampled. Simple linear regression models were developed for biomass estimation. The results shown that root collar diameter was the most accurate biomass predictor, whilst intercept and slope values {{were similar to those}} identified in other recent studies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{evolution}} of climate changes during the period 2001 - 2014 in the Oltenia Region of Romania, including Dolj, <b>Olt</b> and Valcea <b>counties.</b> It is based on the statistical data provided by National Meteorologica Administration of Bucharest, Agrometeorological Laboratory. In this paper we want to show the impact of climate changes, because they exist and can be felt on a daily basis. We chose the region of Oltenia as our study zone, because the climate changes from here can be felt both in the atmospheric and in the soil characteristics, especially in its texture. Because of the changes in climatic conditions, the soil is also constantly changing compared to the climatic conditions to which it was initially adapted to. We take into consideration the following agrometeorological parameters: rainfall, average temperature, moisture reserve, “heat” intensity, factors that lead to the degradation of the soil, respectively to the downfall in crop production of the winter wheat and corn crops. In conclusion we will see the differences between the 4 parameters in the 2001 - 2014 period, in comparison with the reference period of 1981 - 2010...|$|R
