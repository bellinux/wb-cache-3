5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} {{platforms}} were extended to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to Portcullis House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried <b>out</b> <b>when</b> the line was closed at night.|$|E

5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names.

As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls <b>out</b> <b>when</b> the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls <b>out</b> <b>when</b> the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

5000|$|September 23 - The Chicago Cubs and New York Giants, {{involved}} in a tight pennant race, (also involving the Pittsburgh Pirates) were tied {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants had runners on first and third and two <b>outs</b> <b>when</b> Al Bridwell hit a single to center field, scoring Moose McCormick from third with the Giants’ apparent winning run, but the runner on first base, rookie Fred Merkle, thinking the game was over, went half way to second and then sprinted to the clubhouse after McCormick touched home plate. As fans swarmed the field, Cub infielder Johnny Evers retrieved the ball and touched second. A forceout was called at second base, nullifying the single, and because there were 2 <b>outs</b> <b>when</b> the play started, the run was also nullified and the inning ended. The game was declared a tie and would be made up at the end of the season if the Cubs and Giants were tied for first place. The incident became known as the [...] "Merkle Boner".|$|R
