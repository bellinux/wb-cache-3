5|$|I am {{thinking}} this {{morning of the}} men in the mills and factories; I {{am thinking}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who,</b> for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and in their early, tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{reported}} homosexual activity had {{not experienced}} {{it more than}} ten times. Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only one partner. Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon {{who had just}} been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E

5|$|The {{agitation}} {{was backed}} by Periyar's Self-Respect Movement and Justice Party. It also {{had the support of}} Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal, Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars {{were among the first to}} announce their opposition to the Hindi teaching in the Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja conference at Velur. Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. Moovalur Ramamirtham, Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were arrested for participating in the agitation. On 13 November 1938, the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement. The agitation was marked by anti-Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Despite the general anti-Brahminism of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.|$|E

25|$|In other {{instances}} of sexual abuse, soldiers {{were found to}} have raped female inmates, and senior U.S. officials admitted that rape had taken place at Abu Ghraib. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had been raped became pregnant, and in some cases, were later killed by their family members in what were thought to be instances of honor killing.

25|$|Many {{women face}} issues with sexual abuse {{while working in}} {{agriculture}} fields as well. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> work in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse {{in order to keep}} their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because {{the fact that they are}} documented will be brought up and may be deported.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} of their {{contributions}} to the culture of Puerto Rico is Edna Coll, a Puerto Rican of Irish descent.

25|$|Another key {{recommendation}} of the report was to encourage clinicians to promote the flu vaccine to all pregnant women, with flu {{one of the leading}} causes of preventable death in pregnancy (1 in 11 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> died). It was reported that less than half of pregnant women eligible for a free flu vaccine had taken it up. The MBRRACE-UK report notes that of the maternal deaths caused by Flu, more than half could have been prevented had the woman received a flu jab.|$|E

25|$|A 2004 {{study found}} that Chilean women with HIV/AIDS were {{susceptible}} to coerced sterilization. Fifty-six percent of HIV-positive Chilean women reported being pressured by health-care workers to prevent pregnancy by being sterilized. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> chose to be sterilized, half were forced or persuaded to do so. Women victims of domestic abuse face {{a higher risk of}} getting HIV, and in 2004, 56 percent of women who have HIV and 77 percent of women with HIV/AIDS were victims of domestic abuse, sexual abuse, or rape before their diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} has roots in both {{ancient and modern}} Chinese history. Dancing for exercise has been recorded as developed millennia ago in Emperor Yao's China, and during the Song Dynasty the public spaces of cities were noted for their use in performance. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> square dance came of age during the Cultural Revolution, when folk dances such as yangge were widely performed, often as propaganda. Some have confirmed that this nostalgia {{is one of their}} reasons for taking part, although the benefits of the exercise and socialization opportunities also play a role.|$|E
25|$|In 1608 {{the village}} briefly became a {{location}} {{in the story of}} the Pilgrim Fathers of America; their vessel was forced to put ashore due to bad weather, sailing up Killingholme Creek; the women of the party were allowed to sleep in the village church for the night, but news of this reached the authorities, with the consequence that the womenfolk were arrested, whilst the others escaped to the Netherlands. A popular protest secured the release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> were then able to rejoin their families, and continue the journey.|$|E

25|$|The {{current system}} of {{confidential}} enquiries began in 1952, however, the history of smaller, local enquiries dates back to 1917 in Aberdeen, with national enquiries across England, Scotland and Wales following in the 1920s and 1930s. Maternal deaths during this period were particularly prevalent in poor, working-class families, thus {{a large part of}} these early local enquiries was focused on the social backgrounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> died. Further emphasis was placed on educating women and their families on the importance of maternity care as well as an understanding of the warning signs of complications and the importance of seeking help.|$|E
25|$|Saskatchewan medical {{health system}} has faced {{criticism}} {{due to a}} lack of accessibility to the midwifery program. According to Leanne Smith, the director for maternal services in the Saskatoon Health Region declared half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> apply for the midwifery program are turned away. Ministry of Health data shows midwives saw 1,233 clients in the 2012-13 fiscal year (which runs April to March). But in that fourth quarter, 359 women were still on waiting lists for immediate or future care. The provincial Health Ministry received 47 letters about midwifery services in 2012, most of which asked for more midwives. As a continuing problem in the Saskatchewan health care system, more pressure has been placed to recruit more midwives for the province.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, for the Inamed Corporation {{and for the}} Mentor Corporation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted its {{restrictions}} {{against using}} silicone-gel breast implants for breast reconstruction and for augmentation mammoplasty. Yet, the approval was conditional upon accepting FDA monitoring, the completion of 10-year-mark studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> already had the breast implants, and {{the completion of a}} second, 10-year-mark study of the safety of the breast implants in 40,000 other women. The FDA warned the public that breast implants do carry medical risks, and recommended that women who undergo breast augmentation should periodically undergo MRI examinations to screen for signs of either shell rupture or of filler leakage, or both conditions; and ordered that breast surgery patients be provided with detailed, informational brochures explaining the medical risks of using silicone-gel breast implants.|$|E
