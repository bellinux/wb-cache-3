5|$|Arrogance deserves <b>oblivion.</b>|$|E
5|$|During 1997, Fantasy World (the area of Alton Towers {{in which}} <b>Oblivion</b> was {{eventually}} situated) was closed off {{and all the}} old fantasy-themed rides were removed except the Black Hole. Details about <b>Oblivion</b> were not revealed until March 1998.|$|E
5|$|At the 2007 E3, the Game of the Year edition for <b>Oblivion</b> was announced. In North America and Europe, {{the game}} was {{released}} in September 2007, for the Xbox360 and PC, and in October 2007, for the PS3; in Australia, it was released on September 2007, for the Xbox360 and PC, and in December 2007, for the PS3. It was also released on Steam on June 16, 2009. A 5th-anniversary edition of <b>Oblivion</b> was announced and released in North America in July 2011 and in Europe two months later. An Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3 and <b>Oblivion</b> double pack was announced for release in North America on April 3, however it was not mentioned whether the bundled games include any of the downloadable content released for either game.|$|E
5|$|Sweet <b>Oblivion,</b> {{released}} in 1992, brought the band {{to a new}} level of commercial success, and the Screaming Trees found itself amidst the sudden popularity of the Seattle music scene. In 1996, the band released its seventh studio album, Dust; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by Sweet <b>Oblivion.</b> Screaming Trees disbanded in 2000 due to conflicts among the members regarding the band's creative direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by the United States software company Bethesda Softworks. Ken Rolston, who was Morrowinds lead designer, oversaw the development team. The PC and Xbox360 versions of the game were co-published by 2K Games and Bethesda. Work on <b>Oblivion</b> began shortly after the release of Morrowind in 2002. By mid-September 2004, <b>Oblivion</b> had been officially announced, and its title revealed.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} <b>Oblivion</b> focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. <b>Oblivion</b> features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|In June, <b>Oblivion</b> {{suffered}} downtime {{owing to}} a gearbox component failing. The ride remained closed {{for a few}} weeks while a replacement part was manufactured. The ride re-opened on 25 June.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nines quest {{begins as}} the player {{approaches}} the Chapel of Dibella in Anvil. The Chapel was recently abused; everyone {{there has been}} killed in a dark ritual. The player proceeds to consult a prophet near the scene of the attack, who is preaching about it. The prophet reveals to the player that the one responsible for the attacks is Umaril, an ancient revenge-seeking Ayleid sorcerer-king, who has escaped from his prison in <b>Oblivion</b> to destroy Cyrodiil. Umaril can only be defeated by the prophesized Crusader, favoured by the gods, bearing the relics of Pelinal Whitestrake, the man who originally slew Umaril, and banished his spirit to <b>Oblivion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oblivion's opening was {{accompanied}} by a massive publicity drive, including appearances on Blue Peter, The Gadget Show, news channels and cereal boxes. In 1997, before <b>Oblivion</b> opened, some marketing memorabilia was released, including its own brand of deodorant.|$|E
5|$|When Galaxity disappears in The Wrath of Hypsis he contemplates {{following}} his fellows into <b>oblivion,</b> much to Laureline's horror. Even afterwards, {{he feels the}} loss of Galaxity much more than Laureline, as it is his birthplace.|$|E
5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness, who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on <b>Oblivion.</b> Although based on scientific facts, his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for <b>Oblivion.</b> The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of Darkness during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether <b>Oblivion</b> is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of Darkness maintains that the ride is safe, before the video ends with the sound of his ominous laughter.|$|E
5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, <b>Oblivion,</b> opened at Alton Towers. Though <b>Oblivion</b> is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gasparo's {{reputation}} {{fell into}} <b>oblivion</b> caused by unfavourable secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed {{from the end}} of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical studies that have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery of his works.|$|E
5|$|After his exile, Larrea {{moved to}} Bordeaux in France, and did {{business}} {{with some of}} his old associates. He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia, and in 1818 he moved to Montevideo, under Brazilian control at that time, and strengthened his contacts in Buenos Aires from there. He was finally able to return to Buenos Aires in 1822 due to the <b>oblivion</b> law.|$|E
5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an <b>Oblivion</b> release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a conference call with analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with <b>Oblivion.</b> News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.|$|E
5|$|Character {{development}} is a primary element of <b>Oblivion.</b> At {{the beginning of the}} game, players select one of many human or anthropomorphic races, each of which has different natural abilities, and customize their character's appearance. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved to}} Bordeaux, France, but {{returned}} to Buenos Aires when his exile was lifted by the <b>Oblivion</b> law. He served as consul for a time, but his business declined and {{he committed suicide}} on June 20, 1847. He was the last surviving member of the Primera Junta.|$|E
5|$|In , Sora's group stumbles upon a {{fortress}} known as Castle <b>Oblivion,</b> believing {{they will find}} Mickey and Riku inside. There, Sora's memories are manipulated by a girl named Naminé, who is being held captive by the group Organization XIII and forced to replace his memories of Kairi with herself. However, as Sora ascends the castle, he meets Naminé and learns the truth from her. Sora still wishes to protect Naminé and stop the Organization members in the castle. After Sora and friends defeat the Organization members controlling the castle, Naminé helps the three restore their memories to their state prior to entering Castle <b>Oblivion,</b> {{at the cost of}} their memories of the events in the castle. This requires them to sleep in the castle for the restoration of memories to be completed.|$|E
5|$|In the Whispers of <b>Oblivion</b> {{campaign}} {{released by}} Blizzard {{ahead of the}} upcoming Legacy of the Void, Amon is revealed to have been resurrected in the Sigma Quadrant's Atrias System. Since his resurrection he has been {{under the protection of}} the Tal'Darim, a fanatical Protoss branch devoted to Amon.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin <b>Oblivion</b> by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for <b>Oblivion,</b> begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oblivion</b> is set {{six years}} after the events of , {{though it is not}} a direct sequel to it or any other game. The game is set in Cyrodiil—a {{province}} of Tamriel, the continent on which all the games in the series have so far taken place.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April 2011 {{the area}} around <b>Oblivion</b> was given a slight revamp to {{incorporate}} promotion for Fanta, the ride's new sponsor. The sponsorship included posters saying '15,000ft drop, bring it on', {{despite the fact that}} the drop is actually 180 ft (55m). However, these were later removed after complaints from riders.|$|E
5|$|The beloved agoraphobic {{author was}} mourned {{by the nation}} he had striven, as soldier, thinker and writer, to rescue from <b>oblivion.</b> Thousands {{attended}} his 22 May 1912 funeral service at St. Alexander's Church on nearby Triple Cross Square (Plac Trzech Krzyży) and his interment at Powązki Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the {{senators}} of Rome {{rushed to the}} Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion condemning his memory to <b>oblivion.</b> Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Ventus is {{mentioned}} in the secret ending of , when Mickey reveals he has learned where Ventus' heart is, having searched for his whereabouts {{for the past ten}} years. In , Sora briefly takes the form of Ventus during a dream, and when his heart is wounded, Ventus' armor appears to protect his body. In the game's ending, Ventus smiles in Castle <b>Oblivion,</b> while he is still asleep.|$|E
5|$|With the new {{roller coaster}} The Smiler opening in 2013, <b>Oblivion</b> {{is no longer}} the only coaster in X Sector, as it had been since Black Hole's closure in 2005. In late January/early February 2013, Alton Towers began a process of {{repainting}} Oblivion's fading grey track, which had become very worn since opening in 1998.|$|E
5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from <b>oblivion</b> in 1960, after 50years of neglect. Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings {{his body to}} the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle <b>Oblivion</b> to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. Back at Radiant Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to sink into the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the heart of a young Sora.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} {{news coverage}} in both {{white and black}} newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into <b>oblivion.</b> Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with <b>Oblivion</b> at Alton Towers {{opening on}} March 14, 1998, {{making it the}} world's first Dive Coaster. The trains {{for this type of}} coaster are {{relatively}} short consisting of two to three cars. Bolliger & Mabillard have recently begun to also use floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience. As of May 2016, ten Dive Coasters have been built, with the newest being Valravn at Cedar Point.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's reign {{came to an}} end in 96 when he {{was assassinated}} by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was {{condemned}} to <b>oblivion</b> by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.|$|E
5|$|Films {{released}} {{during the}} dump months {{have not always}} been consigned to cinematic <b>oblivion.</b> Some, like Tremors and Office Space, have become cult classics. Starting with Cloverfield, some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films like The Devil Inside and Mama in the early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that genre at times of the year other than Halloween and the dump months.|$|E
5|$|Freeman played Lucius Fox in a trilogy of Batman films: Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). During that time, Freeman also {{appeared}} in The Bucket List (2007) opposite Jack Nicholson, Wanted (2008) with Angelina Jolie, and Invictus (2009) with Matt Damon. In 2011, Freeman received the AFI Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. Two years later he starred in action thriller Olympus Has Fallen (2013), science fiction film <b>Oblivion</b> (2013), caper Now You See Me (2013), and comedy Last Vegas. In 2014, Freeman appeared in the science fiction films Transcendence and Lucy.|$|E
5|$|He {{set out for}} England from Scheveningen, {{arrived in}} Dover on 25 May 1660 and reached London on 29 May, his 30th birthday. Although Charles and Parliament granted amnesty to nearly all of Cromwell's {{supporters}} in the Act of Indemnity and <b>Oblivion,</b> 50 people were specifically excluded. In the end nine of the regicides were executed: they were hanged, drawn and quartered; others were given life imprisonment or simply excluded from office for life. The bodies of Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw were subjected to the indignity of posthumous decapitations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oblivion</b> can {{be played}} in either a first-or third-person view, except in the mobile phone version, in which the game can only be played in {{isometric}} projection. The player may change {{the level of difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success for particular actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.|$|E
5|$|Sequels {{to many of}} {{the above}} titles were also {{developed}} for next-gen systems, including Lionhead's Fable II (2008) and Fable III (2010). The Fallout and Baldur's Gate series of PC RPGs spawned console-friendly, Diablo-style action titles for the PS2 and Xbox as their respective PC series ended. Bethesda's <b>Oblivion</b> was released simultaneously for console and PC, but was considered a major launch title for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. BioWare continued to produce launch-exclusive RPG titles for the Xbox 360, such as Mass Effect (2007) and Mass Effect 2 (2010); and released the multi-platform Dragon Age series starting in 2009.|$|E
