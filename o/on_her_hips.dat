500|$|For the {{character}} of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale-like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress {{at the beginning of}} the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a [...] "humongous contrast to the flat drawings" [...] and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be [...] "extremely pouffy" [...] and the skirt to be as big as possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as [...] "grueling" [...] since [...] "the entire weight was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> so occasionally it felt like she was in traction".|$|E
2500|$|As Jordan, Price was {{famed for}} her surgically {{enhanced}} breasts. At 19 {{she had the}} first in a succession of breast-enhancement surgeries, increasing her natural 32B to a 32FF. Unhappy with her breasts from an early age and despite her family's objections, she went ahead with the procedure because she felt that, as a glamour model, she did not look [...] "as sexy or [...] womanly" [...] as other models. She has since had many enhancements, as well as reductions, on her breasts in addition to later having liposuction <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and thighs, fat implanted into her lips to boost her pout, and a nose job. She told a reporter, [...] "Some people may be famous for creating a pencil sharpener. I'm famous for my tits." [...] Price was later barred from Page Three in The Sun with their adoption of a policy to only use [...] "all natural" [...] models.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she {{tried to focus on}} a more naked and physical reality and the search for experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out of her skin. “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E
60|$|And {{having said}} that she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heel and slowly walked away, leaving behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away--with a slow, {{swinging}} stride, one hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> <b>her</b> head thrown back.|$|R

6000|$|She pointed {{dramatically}} at the door, but {{the woman}} retained her position, only moving to cuff the boy, who was kicking Henderson on his shins. Then, setting her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> she said defiantly: ...|$|E

50|$|Following an {{accident}} in 2012, Whelan began experiencing pains in <b>her</b> right <b>hip.</b> In the August following her performance at Jacob's Pillow, Wendy had reconstructive surgery <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> {{to correct a}} labral tear. After months of rehabilitation and physical therapy, Whelan completed the 2014 season with NYCB.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{blocking}} up the doorway with <b>her</b> 'ands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> while I explained, with Kumbo still 'anging {{on my arm}} and a crowd collecting behind, and the more I explained, the more I could see she didn't believe a word of it.|$|R
60|$|Bostil's sister came in {{from the}} kitchen. She was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face. She had her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "He came {{in about}} five minutes ago," [...] said the furmity woman, joining the rest with her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] "And then 'a stepped back, and then 'a looked in again. I'm not a penny the better for him." ...|$|E
60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now put her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and, like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|E

60|$|The younger lady {{looked down}} on her {{companion}} with something of the calm expert attention that a plumber gives to a tap that is misbehaving, and like a plumber refrained from precipitate action. She stood with {{the backs of her}} hands resting <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Elaine--she {{had this}} poetic name--fingered her cat timidly, {{not knowing what}} to say or to do, unable even to ask her visitor to sit down. He noticed how her skirt hung almost flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> She was young, scarce developed, a long, slender thing. Her {{colouring}} was warm and exquisite.|$|E
60|$|I {{enjoyed it}} so little, indeed, that I fell to poking the sitting-room fire {{when she entered}} with the Mercury; and read the Mercury assiduously while she brought in breakfast. She set down the tray with a slam and stood beside it, her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> her whole {{attitude}} breathing challenge.|$|E
50|$|Göras made eight Damallsvenskan {{appearances}} for Djurgårdens in 2008 {{and required}} surgery <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> While recuperating, she {{was offered a}} full-time job with the Swedish Football Academy and decided to stop her playing career.

5000|$|..... {{just like}} a doll, she was, but alive. Her hair was red, her sarafan blue, and she held a blue kerchief in her hand. She looked around them merrily and her teeth sine white.

60|$|When he thus spoke we were come {{opposite}} a small, rude dwelling situate in {{one corner}} of a pasture wherein even a sheep would have found it difficult to satisfy its hunger, and in the door of this building stood a motherly looking old woman, her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and her eyes fixed on us in curiosity, as I fancied.|$|E
6000|$|The {{woman with}} the coffee-pot here faced about, stood up, and, either from design or some odd coincidence, fell into the same dogged {{attitude}} {{that her husband had}} previously taken, except that she rested her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> She was prematurely aged, like many of her class, and her black, snake-like locks, twisting loose from her comb as she lifted her head, showed threads of white against the firelight. Then with slow and implacable deliberation she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think, miss," [...] said she, [...] "that old {{bundle of}} a cook that was here this mornin' has been doin'? She's been bringin' cauld vittles from the docther's kitchen to that nager Mike, {{as if you}} an' Mr. Haverley didn't give him enough to eat. I looked in at his winder, a wonderin' what he wanted wid a fire in summer time, an' saw him heatin' the stuff. It's an insult to me an' the family, miss, that's what it is." [...] And the irate woman rested her {{knuckles}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{smile of}} triumph went over his face. Madame watched him stonily {{as she stood}} beside her chair, one hand lightly {{balanced}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> Alvina was reminded of Kishwégin. But even in Madame's stony mistrust there was an element of attraction towards him. He had taken his cigarette case from his pocket.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Fair Musician" by Le Roux, depicting {{a woman with a}} lute, [s. d. ].

Her left leg is raised, and she rests the body of the lute <b>on</b> <b>her</b> thigh and <b>her</b> free hand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> <b>Her</b> hair is dark and blends in with the background, while her eyes are so heavily shadowed that her pupils cannot be seen.

50|$|Self-Portrait on {{the sixth}} anniversary of {{marriage}} was painted in Paris. She had moved from Worpswede near Bremen in Germany in February 1906. Modersohn-Becker had decided to leave her husband and Worpswede forever, and devote herself entirely to art. This self-portrait was painted in the spring. She is turned to the {{right in front of}} the viewer and she watches the viewer with a searching and questioning look. She has a white cloth <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> <b>Her</b> upper body is naked and <b>on</b> <b>her</b> neck she wears an amber necklace.|$|R
6000|$|The {{waitress}} {{was instantly}} back with soup, {{and a collection}} of china gathered by a man of much travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha. She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch Mr. Boltwood's sleeve, brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips, picked for a while, gave it up, put her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and addressed Claire: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the most}} terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been {{accustomed}} of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, {{who worked in the}} yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his step-daughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf.|$|E
6000|$|And then {{faster and}} faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out {{in the air and}} then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, {{cracking}} his whip and shouting [...] "Hi!--hi!" [...] and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.|$|E
