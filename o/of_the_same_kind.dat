5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E
5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E

5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind.</b> Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, {{has been able to}} do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.|$|E

25|$|Samuel von Sömmerring {{described}} the new species Lacerta gigantea for fossils {{discovered in a}} Bavarian iron mine, mistakenly believing them to be additional remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of animal that was discovered in Masstricht. These remains belonged to an animal that was actually {{more closely related to}} modern crocodiles and is now known as Geosaurus.|$|E

50|$|The new {{ballpark}} {{was intended}} to be more directly connected to its urban surroundings than was the old stadium at the fairgrounds, and also to have many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> luxury amenities available in a major-league ballpark, both for fans and for the players and coaches.|$|R
50|$|In recent decades, optimal {{foraging}} {{theory has}} often been applied to <b>the</b> foraging behavior <b>of</b> human hunter-gatherers. Although this is controversial, coming under some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> attack as <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> sociobiological theory to human behavior, it does represent a convergence of ideas from human ecology and economic anthropology that has proved fruitful and interesting.|$|R
25|$|Much {{the same}} way that the {{influential}} Duke Ellington matched his scores to the unique abilities of his performers, Hefti was able to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of 'fine-tuning' to bring out the best of the talents of the Basie band. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that when the same charts are played by a different band, even the composer's own, that the result is not as strong.|$|E
25|$|Maxime Rodinson {{says that}} it is most {{probable}} that Muhammad's conditions was basically <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> as that found in many mystics rather than epilepsy. Fazlur Rahman refutes epileptic fits for the following reasons: Muhammad's condition begins with his career at the age of 40; according to the tradition seizures are invariably associated with the revelation and never occur by itself. Lastly, a sophisticated society like the Meccan or Medinese would have identified epilepsy clearly and definitely.|$|E
25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E
40|$|We are all patterns, {{dynamically}} evolving ones, but patterns nonetheless. There {{is nothing}} special about the individual atoms that constitute our bodies. They {{could all be}} replaced by other atoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds,</b> and neither we nor anyone else would notice the difference. So {{what is it about}} our particular arrangement of atoms that makes us alive and our distinctive selves? Indeed, what is life...|$|R

50|$|Saana (Sána) is a fell in Enontekiö, Finland. Saana's summit lies 1029 m {{above sea}} level and 556 m above the {{adjacent}} Kilpisjärvi lake. Geologically it is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scandinavian Mountains, and is made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> schist and gneiss rock. The mountain was historically considered sacred to the Sami people. The peak is a popular destination for hikers and backpackers because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweeping views offered at the summit.|$|R
25|$|Since {{fluorine}} is {{a relatively}} small atom with a large electronegativity, its covalent radius is difficult to evaluate. The covalent radius is defined as half the bond lengths between two neutral atoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> connected with a single bond. By this definition, the covalent radius of F is 71pm. However, the F-F bond in F2 is abnormally weak and long. Besides, almost all bonds to fluorine are highly polar because of its large electronegativity, so {{the use of a}} covalent radius to predict the length of such a bond is inadequate and the bond lengths calculated from these radii are almost always longer than the experimental values.|$|E
25|$|To be {{prepared}} against any future attempt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind,</b> Otto judged it prudent {{at this time}} to enter into a treaty with his maternal uncle King Valdemar II of Denmark, by which they respectively bound themselves to support each other against all enemies whatsoever. This treaty was in the end most injurious to the states of Brunswick. Otto was made count of Garding and Thetesbüll by King Valdemar, and participated in the Battle of Mölln of 1225 and the Battle of Bornhöved of 1227 on the side of Denmark. After the last battle Otto was imprisoned in Rostock, the capital of Schwerin, where he was shut up in a fortress.|$|E
25|$|A taunt is {{a battle}} cry, a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or insult {{intended}} to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can exist {{as a form of}} social competition to gain control of the target's cultural capital (i.e. status). In sociological theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly bullying, or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind,</b> to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to fighting words and trash-talk.|$|E
50|$|Dancing Sushi was {{produced}} from October 2007 to December 2007. It {{was intended as}} a way to continue offering fans of Kappa Mikey more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> characters in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> universe, and also to keep animators working on the transition between the studio's two major shows; Speed Racer: The Next Generation was in production soon afterward. At one point, there was consideration to reprise some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kappa Mikey characters into this series as well.|$|R

50|$|Early on, it was {{apparent}} that Arman's concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> vast quantities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> objects was to remain a significant component of his art. Ironically, he had originally focused more attention on his abstract paintings, considering them to be of more consequence than his early accumulations of stamps. Only when he witnessed viewer reaction to his first accumulation in 1959 did he fully recognize <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> such art. In 1962, he began welding together accumulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> metal objects, such as axes (as pictured below).|$|R
25|$|Successful snail culture {{requires}} the correct equipment and supplies, including: snail pens or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity (hygrometer), temperature (thermometer), soil moisture (soil moisture sensor), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and {{an instrument to}} measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate (temperature and humidity), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.|$|E
25|$|Formerly it was bounded {{with the}} codex 566 in one manuscript. 556 {{contains}} Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Mark, {{it is written}} in minuscule letters. The {{two parts of the}} manuscript agree in form (two columns, 23 lines per column), in signatures, in the writing of the scholia, and text-type. The marginal notes are written in the same small uncial letters. The nomina sacra are abbreviated in the same way. Also errors (e.g. itacisms, N ephelkystikon, iota adscriptum, no iota subscriptum etc.) are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind.</b> It is sure that these two parts were written by the same hand. Alfred Rahlfs noted that codex E of the Septuagint was also written partly in uncials and partly in minuscules, in the ninth or tenth century when the change from one style of writing to the other was taking place.|$|E
25|$|Some atomic nuclei {{possess a}} {{magnetic}} moment (nuclear spin), which {{gives rise to}} different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of {{the same type of}} nucleus (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, and so on), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also chemical shift referencing), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.|$|E
60|$|I {{say that}} there are many such {{questions}} asked. But if the world ever runs short of them, I can suggest a large number of questions <b>of</b> precisely <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind,</b> based on precisely <b>the</b> <b>same</b> principle.|$|R

25|$|He {{studied a}} {{question}} analogous {{to that of}} the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincaré went further; if the area is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time intervalt. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, has no fixed point. then this is not necessarily the case.|$|E
25|$|The Textus Receptus was {{defended by}} John William Burgon in his The Revision Revised (1881), {{and also by}} Edward Miller in A Guide to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament (1886). Burgon {{supported}} his arguments with the opinion that the Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Ephraemi, were older than the Sinaiticus and Vaticanus; and also that the Peshitta translation into Syriac (which supports the Byzantine Text), originated in the 2nd century. Miller's arguments in favour of readings in the Textus Receptus were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind.</b> However, both Burgon and Miller believed that, although the Textus Receptus was to be preferred to the Alexandrian Text, nevertheless it still required to be corrected in certain readings against the manuscript tradition of the Byzantine text. In this judgement they have been criticised by Edward F. Hills. Hills argues that the principle that God provides truth through scriptural revelation, necessarily also implies that God must ensure a preserved transmission of the correct revealed text, continuing into the Reformation era of biblical translation and printing. For Hills, the task of biblical scholarship is to identify the particular line of preserved transmission through which God is acting; a line which he sees in the specific succession of manuscript copying, textual correction and printing, which culminated in the Textus Receptus and the King James Bible. Hills argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed Textus Receptus must be the closest text to the Greek autographs; and consequently he rejects readings in the Byzantine Majority Text where these are not maintained in the Textus Receptus. He {{goes so far as}} to conclude that Erasmus must have been providentially guided when he introduced Latin Vulgate readings into his Greek text; and even argues for the authenticity of the Comma Johanneum.|$|E

"At {{this moment}} [...] came the direful {{struggle}} between the great parties in Congress founded upon the claim which the majority ... from {{the north of the}} Potomac made to the right to lay any tax upon the importations into the United States which was intended to act as a protection to northern manufacturers by excluding foreign fabrics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind.</b> Hence all the states to the south of the Potomac became dependent upon the Northern States for a supply of whatever thing they might want, and in this way the South was compelled to sell its products low and buy from the North all articles it needed from twenty-five to one hundred and twenty-five per cent higher than from France to England ...
