While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the girl out of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters {{one of the officers}} and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E

25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} god of beginnings {{has been}} clearly expressed in numerous ancient sources, among them most notably Cicero, Ovid, and Varro. As a god of motion, Janus looks after passages, causes actions {{to start and}} presides over all beginnings. Since movement and change are interconnected, he has a double nature, symbolised in his two headed image. He has under his tutelage the stepping in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of homes, the ianua, which took its name from him, and not vice versa. Similarly, his tutelage extends to the covered passages named iani and foremost to {{the gates of the}} city, including the cultic gate of the Argiletum, named Ianus Geminus or Porta Ianualis from which he protects Rome against the Sabines. He is also present at the Sororium Tigillum, where he guards the terminus of the ways into Rome from Latium. He has an altar, later a temple near the Porta Carmentalis, where the road leading to Veii ended, as well as being present on the Janiculum, a gateway from Rome out to Etruria.|$|E

If you train them, they'll retrieve. They'll do anything to please you." ...|$|E

500|$|After a {{dramatic}} Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he [...] "...didn't really feel {{the flight was}} a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." [...] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and [...] the capsule was lifted partly {{out of the water}} to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and into a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier [...] The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

She is nearly run over as she confronts Will and Emma when they begin to go for a test drive in his spontaneously {{acquired}} Corvette. Terri tells Will {{to get out of the}} car and they get into an argument, which causes Emma to leave the scene. The words simmer down and Terri advises Will to return the car to the dealership, because he cannot afford it. Before leaving, she says that Emma will break Will's heart again and he'll return to her eventually. In [...] "The Substitute", Terri returns to take care of a sick Will. They have sex, but the next day when she sees Will's substitute, Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow) at his apartment having a beer with him, she becomes suspicious and makes several snarky comments to Holly.

She plans to take the job as a chance to move on with her life and give herself a fresh start in a new location.|$|E
500|$|In Morning, a lady {{makes her}} way to church, {{shielding}} herself with her fan from the shocking view of two men pawing at the market girls. The scene is {{the west side of}} the piazza at Covent Garden, indicated by a part of the Palladian portico of Inigo Jones's Church of St Paul visible behind Tom King's Coffee House, a notorious venue celebrated in pamphlets of the time. Henry Fielding mentions the coffee house in both The Covent Garden Tragedy and Pasquin. At the time Hogarth produced this picture, the coffee house was being run by Tom's widow, Moll King, but its reputation had not diminished. Moll opened the doors once those of the taverns had shut, allowing the revellers to continue enjoying themselves from midnight until dawn. The Mansion House with columned portico visible in the centre of the picture, No. 43 King Street, is attributed to architect Thomas Archer (later 1st Baron Archer) and occupied by him at the date of Hogarth's works. It was situated on the north side of the piazza, while the coffee house was on the south side, as depicted in Hogarth's original painting. In the picture, it is early morning and some revellers are ending their evening: a fight has broken out in the coffee house and, in the melÃ©e, a wig flies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> [...] Meanwhile, stallholders set out their fruit and vegetables for the day's market. Two children who should be making their way to school have stopped, entranced by the activity of the market, in a direct reference to Swift's A Description of the Morning in which children [...] "lag with satchels in their hands". Above the clock is Father Time and below it the inscription Sic transit gloria mundi. The smoke rising from the chimney of the coffee house connects these portents to the scene below.|$|E

2500|$|The tagged man chases a group into {{a subway}} station, where they cram {{themselves}} into a departing train.

He frustratedly pulls his arm <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and, after glancing to his left, begins strolling nonchalantly past the train, its occupants jammed against the window watching him. The camera cuts ahead to reveal a lone straggler who failed to make it onto the train.

2500|$|To {{counteract}} {{the large number}} of departures, Robinson introduced several new characters, among them Melanie Healy played by Tamzin Outhwaite. In an interview with website Walfordweb, Matthew Robinson has stated that Melanie was [...] "dreamt up to supplement the 'totty' contingent â€“ running thin at the time". Robinson stated that Tamzin Outhwaite was [...] "a shoo-in â€“ and not just because of her beautiful blonde hair. Within a minute of her walking into auditions, hundreds already having trooped in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> I knew we had our star." [...] Outhwaite has stated that she was given the role without having to do a screen-test. Mel was brought into the serial {{as a member of the}} already established Healy family, joining her brother Reverend Alex Healy (Richard Driscoll) and father Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) in October 1998. Initially Mel's relationship with Alex and Jeff was not disclosed to viewers, and it was several weeks after her introduction that Mel actually came face-to-face with her brother on-screen; it was revealed that she had been estranged to them for some time.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was then}} matched up with UFC 5 tournament {{champion}} Dan Severn at UFC 6 on July 14, 1995 {{to determine the}} reigning champion of the UFC. The 'superfight', a match presented as a fight between the [...] "best of the best", was still the match that would determine the UFC champion and the tournament winners would be considered the #1 contender for the newly created UFC Superfight Championship (later replaced by the UFC Heavyweight Championship when weight categories {{were introduced to the}} UFC). Their feud began at the pre-fight press conference. After most of the attention from the media was given to Shamrock, Severn got up and walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> without explanation. Shamrock took Severn's action as a sign of disrespect. Severn later said that he walked out because he felt that it would be unfair to Shamrock for him to be present in the room while Shamrock was discussing his fight strategy to the media. Shamrock became even more furious when he found a newsletter back at the hotel that explained to readers how Severn was going to destroy Shamrock. During the match, Shamrock forced Severn to tap out to a choke in 2:14 to win the UFC Superfight Championship.|$|E
2500|$|The Algerian police used {{night vision}} devices to {{identify}} the lead hijacker, Abdul Abdullah Yahia. The government sent his mother to plead for her son to release the passengers, hoping that her pleas would cause Yahia to give in. The tactic backfired. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, said that Yahia became enraged by the attempt. The hijackers began to target the French passengers; two staff members of the Embassy of France in Algeria, a secretary and a chef, were on board. The hijackers used the chef, Yannick Beugnet, by having him plead in the microphone. The hijackers demanded that if the Algerian government did not let the A300 take off before 9:30pm, the hijackers would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The French diplomat said that the Algerians assured them that the hijackers were bluffing while the French demanded that the aircraft {{be allowed to take}} off. When the deadline passed, the hijackers fatally shot the chef. The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, saying [...] "see what you get when you play tough?!". The airline knew that the chef was murdered since it listened to the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, {{said in an interview that}} the airline employees [...] "lived through" [...] the event [...] "with great emotion." [...] Passenger Zahida Kakachi recalls Lotfi calmly converting two stewardesses to Islam, herself and another woman, though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage or upset Lotfi.|$|E
