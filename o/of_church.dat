This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Blois {{had lost}} his legateship before Celestine became pope, {{but it was not}} until about 1150 that Theobald was {{appointed}} legate by Eugene III, perhaps owing to the exhortations of Bernard of Clairvaux. Theobald held the legatine powers in England until his death in 1161. In 1151 Theobald held a legatine council in London. The council was attended by the king and Eustace, the king's eldest son, as well as other members of the nobility. The council decreed eight canons, or ecclesiastical statutes, including ones condemning the pillaging <b>of</b> <b>church</b> properties and the imposition of financial levies on the clergy. Another canon of the council stated that bishops should no longer pursue violators <b>of</b> <b>church</b> property in the royal courts, but should use ecclesiastical courts instead. The other canons dealt with procedural matters arising from excommunications for abusing church property.|$|E
