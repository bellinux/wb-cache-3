30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} a cortical tibial <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap technique that generates a bony bridge during transtibial amputation of adults. In essence, this is a modification of the original technique described by Ertl.|$|E
30|$|A transtibial {{amputation}} {{using the}} cortical tibial <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap technique {{to create a}} bony bridge must be performed as distally as possible; the desired level is the osseous equivalent of the muscle–tendon transition of the gastrocnemius muscle (as in the original Ertl’s technique).|$|E
30|$|Amputation, {{especially}} of the lower limbs, is a surgical procedure that gives excellent results when conducted under the appropriate conditions. In 1949 Ertl developed a technique for transtibial osteomyoplastic amputation which restored the intraosseous pressure through canal obliteration and expanded the area of terminal support through a bony bridge between the fibula and distal tibia. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of a modification of the original Ertl’s technique in which a cortical <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap created from the tibia is used to form a bony bridge during transtibial amputation in adults. Nine patients underwent leg amputations with the cortical tibial <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap technique for reconstruction of the stump. The average duration of follow-up was 30.8 (range, 18 – 41) months. The post-surgery examination included a clinical examination and radiography. A 6 -min walk test (Enright in Respir Care 48 (8): 783 – 785, 2003) was performed in the 32 nd week after amputation. At 24 th week post-surgery, all patients had stumps that were painless and able to bear full weight through the end. The creation of a cortical <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap from the tibia to the fibula during transtibial amputation is a safe and effective technique that provides a strong and painless terminal weight-bearing stump. This constitutes a useful option for young patients, athletes, and patients with high physical demands.|$|E
30|$|This case {{highlights}} the evolving variations in dentoalveolar augmentation {{with an emphasis}} on concomitant implant placement.

Further refinement should consider minimizing crestal reflection and overall labial bone resorption.|$|E
30|$|The {{construction}} of a cortical tibial <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap to achieve a bony bridge during transtibial amputation, which represents a modification of the original technique described by Ertl, is a safe and effective procedure that creates a strong, painless, terminal weight-bearing stump.

30|$|Dental {{restorative}} {{space from}} the opposing dentition requires adequate distance for restorative material for an acceptable restoration. Typically, long-standing edentulous alveolar ridges will have vertical and or horizontal defects that require alveolar ridge augmentation for ideal dental implant restorations. Along with these defects, one {{will see the}} opposing dentition supra erupt which can obliterate the restorative space. Multiple surgical techniques have been described to address these dilemmas. The use of <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flaps has been described to address vertical height deficiencies. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to document and introduce a maxillary segmental <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap intrusion to increase the restorative space with simultaneous dental implant placement. As with most dilemmas in treatment planning dental implants, multiple acceptable treatment options are available to the practitioner. This technique is another of many that can be added to the available options. When appropriately planned in select cases, this technique will result with ideal dental implant restorations without compromising the esthetic and functional harmony of the native dentition.|$|E
40|$|Background: The unicystic {{variety of}} ameloblastoma is {{reported}} to be significantly less prone to recurrence in young patients than its conventional counterpart, and therefore can be treated conservatively. This paper describes a technique of using an <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap to allow complete enucleation of a unicystic ameloblastoma. The technique maintains the continuity of the mandible and restores full thickness as well as strength of the mandible to promote early healing. It also maintains blood supply and proper facial contour so that esthetics is unimpaired. Materials and Methods: We describe two cases of unicystic ameloblastoma in which we used an <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap. This flap was then infractured at the lower border to obliterate the dead space. Results: The sequential radiographs demonstrate early incorporation of the graft and complete filling of the defect by 3 months. At 5 years of follow-up in our first case, complete healing of bone was observed. Conclusions: We believe that these procedures can be the treatment of choice in such cases, especially with larger lesions, as these rapidly restore the patient′s facial contour to normal as well as reduce the healing time...|$|E
30|$|The {{cortical}} <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap, {{which is}} a modification of the Ertl’s bony bridge technique, {{has the advantage of}} a vascularised flap made of large strut grafts. A larger support area allows for wider distribution of the pressure which reduces the likelihood of pain and increases the weight-bearing ability of the terminal stump. This is particularly important for meeting the greater functional demands of certain patients such as young people, athletes, military personnel, and professionals who exert high levels of physical effort [15].|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} a radius defect model {{was created to}} compare healing of bovine DBM implant as a new {{xenograft}} and fresh autogenous cortical bone graft in the rabbit model. This model has been reported previously suitable {{because there was no}} need for internal or external fixation that can influence the healing process [29]. The <b>osteoperiosteal</b> segemental defect was created in middle portion of radius at least twice as long as the diameter of diaphysis to produce nonunion model and prevent spontaneous healing [26].|$|E
30|$|When the <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap is complete, {{a cushion}} must be {{prepared}} from the two muscle flaps, the aponeurosis, and the remaining intact deep fascia. These must be sculpted properly so as {{to allow them to}} be sutured together under mild tension. As described for the original Ertl’s technique, the deep posterior compartment musculature should be resected at the same level as the tibial osteotomy, leaving only the gastrocnemius muscle as a posterior muscular flap. For the tibia, the prominence formed by its crest must be sculpted with round corners without osseous prominences.|$|E
30|$|Primary wound closure {{performed}} {{within the}} zone of injury is {{a significant predictor of}} subsequent wound problems, regardless of the amputation technique used [16]. In this series of patients, all the amputations were for trauma and chronic infection and, for safety reasons and {{to reduce the risk of}} secondary wound complications (e.g. dehiscence and stump infection), were left open with sterile dressings for 48  h using negative-pressure wound therapy; thereafter, a second examination was performed, at which point the <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap was constructed and the wound closed [16].|$|E
30|$|The <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap or “bone flap” {{commonly}} used in segmental orthognathic surgery is a bone fragment moved in space without detachment of the investing periosteum [5]. The prerequisite for simultaneous implant placement in a vertical repositioning bone flap is adequate width within the transport segment. It is always a fine balance between allowing enough exposure to place the fixation device without significantly compromising periosteal vascular input into the bone segment. As it is well documented both clinically and experientially, full thickness mucoperiosteal releases will cause some degree of bone resorption at the labial plate [6].|$|E

30|$|A {{drawback}} of all bony bridge techniques is {{that the}} initial level of the lesion cannot lie very proximal to the tibia, as this would prevent {{the construction of an}} <b>osteoperiosteal</b> flap of appropriate length. This means that the derivation of a bony bridge is impossible in oncological cases that require a wide surgical margin, as well as in many cases of trauma. In the cases presented here, the amputations were performed on patients who had experienced trauma to the lower limbs requiring early amputation or on patients who required amputation following the development of painful chronic osteomyelitis.|$|E

The bone-grafting material included fresh auto- and allografts, frozen and thimerosal preserved allografts, and partially demineralized bone allografts. The grafts were evaluated by roentgenograms, microradiograms, photon absorptiometry, porosity, fluorescence labeling measurements, and torsional loading at failure. Autografts achieved a better union score than the allografts, but intracortical bone porosity, percentage of cumulative new bone, and mineral apposition rate were not variables with statistical significance. Lamellar bone was found earlier and in greater quantity in autografts. Within the graft, new bone was deposited at a slower rate than in the recipient bone. Autografts showed less peripheral resorption and a greater torsional resistance than allografts. Photon absorptiometry demonstrated that nondemineralized allografts underwent a substantial loss of peripheral bone. This marked reduction in the outer diameter of the graft had more influence on torsional resistance than did the intracortical porosity of the graft.

The study was carried out on nine cases; in six cases the critical-size defect was filled with rhBMP- 7 in the β-TCP scaffolding, and in three cases the β-TCP was used alone. The cases were sacrificed 3  months post-operatively. Histologically the overall mean {{of the percentage of}} regenerated bone volume in the cases that received rhBMP- 7 was 29. 41 % ±  6. 25 %, which was considerably greater than the 6. 35 % ±  3. 08 % in the cases treated with β-TCP alone. Mechanical testing of the cases treated with rhBMP- 7 gave failure moments (55  mNm- 2. 040  Nm) that were consistently greater than those treated with β-TCP alone (0  mNm- 48  mNm). In some cases the mechanical properties of the regenerated bone were comparable to those of untreated bone.

Norfolk adult female rabbits – approximately 13 months of age with a mean body weight of 4. 5 kg – are used. In both radial diaphyses, 1 cm <b>osteoperiosteal</b> segmental defects are created. The defect in the left radius is filled with the castor-oil-based polyurethane, and the right one, filled with cancellous bone autograft, collected from the left proximal humerus. The rabbits are euthanazed at 15, 30, 60, and 120 days postsurgery (5 animals/ period), for histological analyses. By radiographic analyses, at these time points, the bone regeneration is more evident and accelerated in the bone defects treated with the cancellous bone autograft. At 120 days postsurgery, the segmental bone defects treated with the cancellous bone autograft are totally reconstituted and remodeled, while the bone defects treated with polyurethane polymer have bone formation of 79 %. Histological study shows that the polyurethane acts as a space filler, minimizing the local production of fibrous tissue. No granule degradation, resorption or any inflammatory reaction is detected.

The study was conducted on six adult sheep in which a critical size defect was created at {{the body of the}} mandible and was reconstructed using rhOP- 1 with type-I collagen as a carrier. Ultrasound images were used to assess onset of bone formation, contour, and surface topography. The results were then compared to corresponding plain radiographs and to post-mortem observations. US showed bone union in all the subjects that concurred with radiographic and post-mortem examinations. US was superior to plain radiography in monitoring early events of ossification. However, it was relatively less efficient in describing the contour of the newly formed bone. It was possible to describe the pattern of bone formation and the dynamic changes in contour and surface topography via US during the follow-up period. In experienced hands, ultrasonography can offer valuable information about bone healing comparable with those obtained by plain radiography. US may replace plain radiography in becoming a routinely used tool for monitoring bone healing in selected sites of the craniofacial skeleton...|$|E

Patients and methodsIn a 3 -year long prospective study, 50 patients (38 men, 12 women) {{with an average age}} of 40. 9  years (range 17 – 60) were treated for neglected diaphyseal nonunion an average of 11  months (range 6 – 48) after the fracture event. The femur was involved 14 times, tibia 22 times, humerus eight times and forearm bones six times. All of these patients had consulted initially with a traditional bone setter at the time of fracture. The surgical procedure consisted of <b>osteoperiosteal</b> decortication followed by repermeabilization of the medullary canal and then internal fixation. Compression plating was used for the humerus, radius and ulna. Nonunion of the middle-third of the femur and tibia was treated by intramedullary nailing and nonunion of the proximal third of the femur with an inverted DCS® screw-plate. Patients were reviewed clinically and with X-rays on postoperative days 21, 45, 90 and 120. ResultsBone union was obtained in under 90 days in the upper limb and under 120 days in the lower limb. No additional grafting was needed. There were only two cases of leg length differences.

40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} published about osteoinductive bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). However, to our knowledge {{there has been no}} detailed histological study of a mandibular defect in a large mammal, reconstructed using BMPs. We describe here the histological features of rhBMP- 7 -induced bone in mandibular defects in sheep. METHODS: A 35 mm <b>osteoperiosteal</b> defect was created at the parasymphyseal region of the mandible in six adult sheep. The continuity of the mandible was maintained using a bony plate, and rhBMP- 7 was applied on a type I collagen carrier. Bone labels were injected at selected time intervals during the follow-up period. The animals were killed after 3 months and bone samples were examined histologically, histomorphometrically, and by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found a mixture of woven and lamellar bone that contained many cells with large nuclei. This had not reorganised to form cortical bone and the rhBMP- 7 -induced bone was more porous than the native bone. The newly-formed bone restored both endosteal and periosteal layers. rhBMP- 7 -induced bone was biocompatible and induced no ossification of soft tissue or abnormal growth of nearby vital structures. The mineral apposition rate was 1. 98 microm/day (range 0. 62 - 5. 63 microm/day), a value close to that reported in humans. This suggests that BMPs have a limited effect in accelerating the rate of mineralisation, but promote the pre-mineralisation processes, and perhaps the formation of woven bone...|$|E
