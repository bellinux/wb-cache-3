5|$|As the Washington Nationals, {{the team}} played their home games at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium from 2005 to 2007; their only home <b>opener</b> {{there was a}} 92 loss in 2007 by starter John Patterson. Nationals Park is the team's current field, {{and it was the}} site of the team's 2008 season <b>opener,</b> with {{starting}} pitcher Odalis Pérez on the mound in a game that the Nationals won 32 over the visiting Atlanta Braves.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was first-choice as an <b>opener</b> with Arthur Morris {{throughout}} the Test series, {{although it was}} not until the Third Test that they had a first-wicket partnership of any substance. Morris had broken into the team as an <b>opener</b> after an injury sidelined Bill Brown for the entire season.|$|E
5|$|Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} <b>opener.</b> Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second <b>opener,</b> but made only one, and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E

5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an <b>opener.</b> Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an <b>opener.</b> You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an <b>opener</b> is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|During the drawn Third Test, Barnes {{was injured}} and Ian Johnson {{was used as}} a {{makeshift}} <b>opener</b> because Morris was the only specialist <b>opener</b> left in the team after the omission of Brown. In the meantime, Barnes's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{distinct}} designs of such bottle <b>openers.</b> Wall mounted <b>openers</b> are typically found behind bars in pubs, whilst hand-tool bottle <b>openers</b> {{tend to be}} found and used in domestic environments. Whereas the functional elements of bottle <b>openers</b> (a tooth or lip to catch {{the underside of the}} cap, a fulcrum across which to exert the force that will remove the cap, and usually a lever for mechanical advantage) tend to be consistent (sometimes the lever is the bottle itself), their aesthetic design is subject to very great variety, and a great many decorative types are available.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} <b>opener,</b> Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second <b>opener</b> and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised <b>opener</b> more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} <b>opener,</b> which was customarily against Worcestershire. Despite scoring a century in Australia's most recent Test, Harvey was made 12th man and it appeared {{that he was not}} initially in Bradman's Test plans.|$|E
5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian <b>opener</b> Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian <b>opener,</b> Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the line behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he had used the optimal tactics in the final sprint, but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E

50|$|A gate {{operator}} is {{a mechanical}} device used {{to open and}} close a gate, such as one {{at the end of}} a driveway. There are two main types of electric gate <b>openers</b> - hydraulic or electromechanical; these can be further split into the following categories, worm (or screw) driven, arm <b>openers</b> and underground <b>openers.</b> Automatic and Electric Gate operators are designed for both swinging and sliding gates. They can be programmed to open and close with a wireless transmitter or a manual device. Low Voltage Automatic Gate <b>openers</b> can also be fitted with solar panels to ensure function during loss of electricity or blackouts.|$|R
40|$|<b>Openers</b> of ATP-sensitive K+ {{channels}} (KATP channels) {{are thought}} to act by enhancing the ATPase activity of sulphonylurea receptors (SURs), the regulatory channel subunits. At higher concentrations, some <b>openers</b> activate KATP channels also {{in the absence of}} MgATP. Here, we describe binding and effect of structurally diverse <b>openers</b> in the absence of Mg 2 + and presence of EDTA. Binding of <b>openers</b> to SUR 2 B was measured using a mutant with high affinity for [3 H]glibenclamide ([3 H]GBC). In the absence of Mg 2 +, ‘typical' <b>openers</b> (benzopyrans, cyanoguanidines and aprikalim) inhibited [3 H]GBC binding with Ki values ∼ 200 × higher than in the presence of MgATP. Minoxidil sulphate and nicorandil were inactive, whereas binding of diazoxide was unaffected by MgATP. In the absence/presence of MgATP, N-cyano-N′-(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) -N″- 3 -pyridylguanidine (P 1075) activated the Kir 6. 2 /SUR 2 B channel in inside–out patches with EC 50 = 2000 / 67 nM and Emax= 32 / 134 %. In the absence of Mg 2 +, responses were variable with {{only a small part of}} the variability being explained by a decrease in channel responsiveness with time after patch excision and to differences in the ATP sensitivity between patches. The rank order of efficacy of the <b>openers</b> was P 1075 >rilmakalim ∼nicorandil>diazoxide>minoxidil sulphate. The data show that structurally diverse <b>openers</b> are able to bind to, and to activate the Kir 6. 2 /SUR 2 B channel by a pathway independent of ATP hydrolysis. These effects are observed at concentrations used to define the biochemical mechanism of the <b>openers</b> in the presence of MgATP and allow the <b>openers</b> to be classified into ‘typical' and ‘atypical' KCOs with diazoxide standing apart...|$|R

5|$|Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} <b>opener.</b> Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second <b>opener.</b> He {{was unable to}} make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, and Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett was beaten in flight by Young and was caught by Washbrook. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E
