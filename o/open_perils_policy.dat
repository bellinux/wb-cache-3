These generally include earth movement, water damage, power failure, neglect, war, nuclear hazard, septic tank back-up expenses, intentional loss, and concurrent causation (for HO3). The concurrent causation exclusion excludes losses where both a covered and an excluded loss occur. In addition, the exclusion for building ordinance can mean that increased expenses due to local ordinances {{may not be}} covered. A 2013 survey of Americans found that 41% believed mold was covered, although it is typically not covered if the water damage occurs {{over a period of}} time, such as through a leaky pipe.|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{economic}} sector and a critical source of livelihood in many developing countries. It is particularly exposed to adverse natural events, such as droughts or floods, and the economic costs of major disasters may even increase further in the future because of climate change. This unexpected event can lead farmers to poverty if unchecked. Agricultural insurance is a veritable tool that agricultural producers can potentially use to adapt and even mitigate {{the risks associated with}} adverse natural events. This paper describes the importance of agriculture in developing countries, how agricultural insurance can complement and enhance risk management activities. This topic becomes imperative because the traditional adaptation practices alone cannot sustain the farmers in the face of changing climatic scenarios, especially in Nigeria where no formal adaptation blueprint is in place.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between education and national unity in Malaysia {{can be put}} into perspective based on the policies and practices that were introduced before and after 1969, When a racial riot put {{the efforts of the}} government to build nationhood at <b>peril.</b> The earlier <b>policies</b> were essentially transitory and transformational to recreate the British educational set lip into an indigenous system. The post-independent Malaysia had accepted the vernacular schools approach from the British to cater for the educational needs of the Malays, Chinese, and Indians, who formed the major groups of the population. Nevertheless, it introduced Malay as the national language and main medium of instruction, and curricular reforms to reflect Malaysia's historicity, geography, culture and economic activities. At that time, national unity was somewhat taken for granted. The 1969 civil war altered the strategic position of the government towards education. The realization was that education had to be coupled with the socioeconomic restructuring of the society; hence, the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1970. However, in due course, the new policies were perceived as favoring mainly the indigenous people, which further deepened the divide among the races. In the past decade, specific policies to harness racial unity have been put forth such as the Vision School, Student Integration Plan for Unity, Civic and Citizenship Education, Race Relations education; and most recently, the 'One Malaysia' concept for inclusion. Analyzing the impact of these policies on national unity would help to unravel the nature of {{relationship between}} them...|$|R
40|$|A history seminar {{paper on}} how imperialist powers used {{indigenous}} manpower in their Southern Rhodesia colony {{to further their}} military interests during the First & Second World Wars. Paper Presented In Seminar Room, University of Rhodesia, Mt. Pleasant, Salisbury, May 11. The use of indigenous peoples for military purposes was common to most imperialist powers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Indian subcontinent had been a proving ground for this policy {{in the eighteenth century}} when both the British and French East India Companies had deployed Sepoys to overcome the Indian principalities, to fight alongside European units in their struggle for supremacy and then, in the case of Britain, to police the vast region. The problem of providing sufficient white manpower to extend and police the British Empire was a chronic one, and 'native' manpower was the obvious answer, the concomitant of the exploitation of potentially vast quantities of cheap labour in the commercial sphere. The <b>perils</b> of this <b>policy</b> for the maintenance of British supremacy and the problem of 'policing the policemen' were made bloodily clear in the Indian Mutiny. Despite this setback to the policy of using native levies the principle nonetheless remained intact. Indigenous troops were used throughout the Empire, including Africa, as in the Zulu War, the campaigns in Egypt and the Sudan in the 1880 s and 1890 s and in East Africa and Nyasaland in the 1890 s. In the latter case the disparate territorial units which came to make up the King's African Rifles in the early 1900 s were first formed in the 1890 s to aid in the imposition and consolidation of colonial rul...|$|R
40|$| {{the social}} {{doctrine}} of the Church and a membership restricted to Roman Catholics. With time and experience this formula has been gradually modified: since 1943, {{the ranks of the}} CCCL have been opened to all workers regardless of their religious convictions. However, three main problems remain for discussion: (a) doctrinal orientation, (b) organization reform, and (c) affiliation with the CLC. (a) Doctrinal orientation. All members are agreed about the value of the principles of the Church's social doctrine and wish to see them applied to labour relations; nonetheless, some of them wish to adhere to such principles without including them in the constitution, in order to help expansion in heavy industry and in big cities like cosmopolitan Montreal. Opponents maintain that any modification would be a backing down to materialism and a betrayal {{of the founders of the}} CCCL; to this the reply is made that circumstances have changed since 1921 : it is now no longer possible to envisage the CCCL as uniting all the workers of the province. At any rate, the Cardinal Archbishop of Montreal and the Primate of Quebec have asked the CCCL leaders to prepare a memorandum on doctrinal orientation. (b) Organizational reform. This has been under consideration for a number of years; accepted in principle, it has not yet brought about unity of application. Paradoxically enough, the CCCL is organized on a basis which is too decentralized and too democratic; with a membership of 100, 000, it is structured for 1, 000, 000. The central authority is thus deprived of effective power, certain services are duplicated, and some federations are too weak to play a useful rôle. In the event of affiliation with the CLC, the organizational problem within the CCCL must be solved to insure preservation of its identify. Many projects have been put forward, only to be rejected by the membership. A division exists between the traditionalists and those open to compromise. And furthermore, it is hard to convince local unions and federations used to the greatest latitude in the administration of their funds and the selection of their officers that they should give up certain privileges arid hand them over to higher organizations; problems of personalities are involved; and those who are opposed to eventual affiliation with the CLC fear that organizational reforms may hasten its realization. (c) Affiliation with the CLC. This is perhaps the most controversial question because all the others can be related to it. While the CCCL has achieved remarkable success thanks to the quality of its leadership and to the cohesion of its membership, it stiff remains provincial in scope, while concentration of economic and political power has increased and calls for a similar concentration of union strengh at a national and even at international level. Since the amalgamation which gave birth to the CLC two years ago, this need for union-strength concentration has made it more imperative for the CCCL to think about affiliation, the main question being: Will the CCCL be able in the future to maintain itself, make progess, and continue to render service to the workers if it remains an isolated organization? The traditional attitude in the CCCL has been one of withdrawal into itself, in part as a result of the merciless war which the international unions have waged upon it for a long time. Although the CCCL's official attitudes on affiliation are progressive and discreet, its members are far from being in agreement. At the 1955 convention, the CCCL voted in principle for labour unity. In 1956 it rejected amalgamation and adopted the principle of affiliation with the CLC on condition that it preserved its identity (i. e., its own characteristics and all the privileges of national union status). A committee has been named to discuss with the CLC leaders the implementing of this affiliation. The committee was to present a report to a special convention, which was not held because no agreement could be reached on the problem of organizational reform within the CCCL. When the committee presented its report for adoption at the September 1957 convention, opposition was so strong that the report had to be drastically amended before it was passed by a small majority. Care had to be taken to prevent the principle of affiliation itself from being completely rejected. Such is the state of affairs at the moment. The CCCL executive has its hands tied because certain groups have threatened to withdraw from the organization if it affiliates, while others will perhaps do the same thing if it does not. Some believe that affiliation will soon bring about the complete disappearance of the CCCL; they feel that existence outside the CLC at great risks is better than the certainty of disappearance within it; they insist upon the difficulties that collaboration with the CLC would entail, citing as evidence certain disloyal practices recently and even at present being carried on by certain of the CLC-affiliated unions. Others, without being unduly optimistic, think affiliation would permit the CCCL to continue to play a constructive rôle on behalf of all the workers; they think the status quo is impossible. They are to be found mostly in unions whose members live in Montreal or work in heavy industry. DIVISIVE FACTORS COMMON TO BOTH QFL AND CCCLThere are factors of division common to both the QFL and the CCCL. They are reducible to two: membership and leadership. (a) Membership. Many union members are new, have not yet absorbed completely the basic philosophy of trade-unionism. Many of them have come in because of union-security clauses. Their loyalty towards the union, although real, does not necessarily give them a full understanding of the purpose and importance of union action beyond the bounds of their immediate jobs. When solidarity is called for in the face of some major danger as on the occasion of an important strike, they are prepared to contribute financial support and even to participate in mass demonstrations, but very few are wiling to go any further. The comparatively recent industrialization, the youth of the working class, the lack of collective conscience, the almost complete integration of the individual worker in his own setting, all these explain the weakness of the sense of solidarity. The labouring masses are easily buffeted by external influences that openly or clandestinely enter into collusion against organized labour. There is bound to be a certain time lag between the assumption of attitudes by the leaders and their adoption by the workers. (b) Leadership. The labour leaders in Quebec are often first-rate men; but "they are confronted with a peculiar situation; they are in some respects too advanced for the members whom they are leading; their ideas have developed too far for the workers to be able to absorb them; while they see clearly, they cannot act quickly. Their technical ability is recognized and there is no desire to change them. In any case, one must admit a certain weakness on the part of the leadership that fails to arouse the mass of union workers to a full understanding of the vast problems that will confront them as a group in the near future. It is perhaps because the leaders have a natural tendency to assume that their reactions are of necessity shared by the members, and because they do not devote to the long and thankless task of education the attention it deserves. CONCLUSIONFrictions, conflicts, divergencies are the normal lot of trade-unionism, whether from within or from without, since trade-unionism presupposes democracy and does not go without discussion and divergent viewpoints. But when this resistance and opposition assumes such proportions that the normal and legitimate conflicts cannot find equitable solutions, there is a great danger that in the long run this resistance may gradually create areas of conflict and give rise to a spirit of revolt that can only lead to class struggle. The Quebec labour movement has formed an alert élite. The crises in leadership and organization are merely temporary. External opposition will ultimately force the labour world to unify itself. It is to be hoped that the opposition forces will come to realize the need for observing reasonable limits and will appreciate the <b>perils</b> of the <b>policies</b> now being followed, so that our society may be spared the repetition of experiences which have wrought such havoc in other countries...|$|R
