Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl {{would have been in the}} shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with <b>oil,</b> <b>heating</b> the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E

40|$|The decay {{resistance}} of oil-heat treated aspen wood (Populus tremula l.) against white rot fungi (Coriolus versicolor) and brown rot fungi (Coniophora puteana) was investigated.
