5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor <b>or</b> <b>good</b> underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable <b>or</b> <b>good</b> {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{is roughly}} {{half the size of}} England and Wales and has {{approximately}} the same amount of coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable <b>or</b> <b>good</b> pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing the key factors in the pre-modern economy. Its north Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, which encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Governor would {{consult the}} Executive Council in the {{exercise}} of all his functions (except on trivial or urgent matters or where the public interest made it undesirable). He would not be required to consult in cases where he was specifically authorised by the Constitution to act in his discretion or on the advice of, or after consultation with, some other person or authority. He would in general act in accordance with the advice of the Executive Council but could act against such advice, where he considered it necessary {{in the interests of the}} public order, public faith <b>or</b> <b>good</b> government; in such cases he would be required to seek approval of the Secretary of State for India.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare <b>or</b> <b>good</b> order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the deregistration order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
50|$|Consignment is {{the act of}} consigning, the act {{of giving}} over to another person or agent's charge, custody or care any {{material}} <b>or</b> <b>goods</b> but retaining legal ownership until the material <b>or</b> <b>goods</b> are sold.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all forms of}} {{economic}} activity in the modern boundaries of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Northern Britain in the fifth century, until the advent of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century, including agriculture, crafts and trade. Having between a fifth or sixth of the arable <b>or</b> <b>good</b> pastoral land and roughly the same amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture.

5|$|In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994), the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made {{pursuant}} to section 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. This provision {{allows for the}} dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace, welfare <b>or</b> <b>good</b> order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 {{pursuant to}} section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act, prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} Minister's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal <b>or</b> <b>good</b> memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E
