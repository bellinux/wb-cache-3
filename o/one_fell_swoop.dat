5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: one on the left advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, one on the right making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main central column, led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The central column would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in <b>one</b> <b>fell</b> <b>swoop.</b> Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R. Godwin-Austen arrived to take command of the enlarged British army.|$|E
5|$|Péraud's time {{remained}} untouched {{until the}} final group of riders set off, and with 's Simon Špilak coming closest to Péraud {{in a time of}} 19' 59", having faded from a similar time at the intermediate point of the Col des Quatre Chemins, the stage battle ultimately came down to the two riders in contention for the overall honours; Wiggins and 's Lieuwe Westra. Westra set off two minutes before Wiggins, and although noted as proficient in the time trial discipline, he left everything on the hill as he set the fastest time to the intermediate checkpoint; recording a time of 11' 29", taking around three seconds per kilometre out of Péraud's time of 11' 47". Two minutes later, Wiggins passed the same point two seconds slower than Westra, but a stronger second half to the stage sealed the victory for Wiggins; as the hill flattened, Wiggins' time-trial experience proved pivotal as he overhauled the deficit to Westra, and finished the stage with a two-second advantage over Westra, taking the stage win, overall victory and the points classification in <b>one</b> <b>fell</b> <b>swoop.</b> 's Alejandro Valverde, who had held the lead of the points classification prior to the stage, could only muster sixth on the stage, but this result was good enough for him to claim the final remaining place on the podium.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Russian River was one {{of several}} rivers {{draining}} westward from the Mayacamas Mountains through the Mendocino Plateau to the sea, a region lifted up by tectonic forces. The Navarro River drained from the Cobb Mountain area, while the Russian River drained from the Mt. St. Helena area. Being at a lower elevation, the Russian River began cutting north into the drainage area of the Navarro River. Eroding up a fault line in Alexander Valley, the Russian River intersected the Navarro River just north of Cloverdale. In <b>one</b> <b>fell</b> <b>swoop,</b> the Russian River took Big Sulphur Creek (formerly the upper Navarro River) and the north fork of the Navarro River, going north to Hopland and to Ukiah. The high valleys were eroded into rocky canyons for ten miles north of Cloverdale and for five miles east of Cloverdale.|$|E
25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in <b>one</b> <b>fell</b> <b>swoop,</b> settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E
500|$|Now {{the course}} of events started to speed up. The new French {{ambassador}} Charles-François Delacroix took the side of the radicals. His behavior sufficiently intimidated the opponents of the radical proposals to actually fall in line. The coup that was to follow was therefore in reality superfluous. Nevertheless, the radicals, led by Wybo Fijnje and Anthonie Willem Ockerse, in cohorts with Pierre Auguste Brahain Ducange, the secretary of the French ambassador, now started to plot the coup d'état of 21–22 January 1798, which, with the assistance of general Daendels, put the radicals in power. A rump assembly of about fifty radicals declared itself a , which in <b>one</b> <b>fell</b> <b>swoop</b> enacted the entire radical program, while {{the other members of the}} Assembly were forcibly detained. All provincial sovereignties were repealed; the dissident members of the Assembly expelled; an [...] "interim Executive Directory" [...] empowered; and the constitutional commission reduced to seven radical members.|$|E

5000|$|Discussing the {{politics}} of Dada is often as contentious as the very politics under discussion. One of the major debates revolves around the question of art/anti-art(which inevitably leads to debates around the essence of [...] "art" [...] itself). It {{is fair to say}} that the Dadaists, and again it is important to reiterate that the Dadaists were only aligned in their rejection of alignment. [...] "If 'Dada' had any attraction for them, it was taken as a call for freeing themselves of any movement, and not as a label for yet another movement.". They were [...] "anti-art," [...] if we take art to be a historically identifiable sociological category of human creative activity. In other words, they were against the bourgeois epoch of [...] "art," [...] as well as those epochs that failed to achieve the frenzied critical representation of society that the Dadaists fed off of and built themselves. Therefore, it is no contradiction to say (or it is a productive contradiction in a dialectical sense) that New York Dada was Anti-Art-Art; their art was an anti-"art" [...] (that is, the art they attempted to overcome). It is evident from the question of art as it appeared to the Dadaists and as their manifesto's described, that art is inherently a political concept, that the creation of art must be a critical practice. This is why the ready-mades were so baffling, they manage to contain the entire critical contradictory thrust of Dada in <b>one</b> <b>fell</b> prefabricated <b>swoop.</b>|$|R

The [...] "evacuated" [...] Jews, he said, would first be sent to [...] "transit ghettos" [...] in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward. Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of [...] "evacuation".

When was in the last <b>fell</b> <b>swoop</b> of Ottomans, Serbian medieval state was destroyed, Koprijan was completely demolished too.
