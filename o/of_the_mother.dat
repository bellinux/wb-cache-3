About 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> using mercury thermometers took the temperature for 5 minutes and about 20 percent for 3 minutes. 3.

About 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> placed <b>the</b> normal temperature between 36. 0 ℃ and 36. 4 ℃. 4.

About half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> {{went to see}} a doctor when their own child 2 ̆ 7 s temperature was in the 37. 0 to 37. 9 ℃ range. 5.

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
