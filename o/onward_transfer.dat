40|$|Background Plasmodium vivax is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} human malaria parasite {{and is likely to}} increase proportionally as malaria control efforts more rapidly impact the prevalence of P. falciparum. Despite the prominence of P. vivax as a major human pathogen, vivax malaria qualifies as a neglected and under-studied tropical disease. Significant challenges bringing P. vivax into the laboratory, particularly the capacity for long-term propagation of well-characterized strains, have limited the study of this parasite's red blood cell (RBC) invasion mechanism, blood-stage development, gene expression, and genetic manipulation. Methodology/Principal findings Patient isolates of P. vivax have been collected and cryopreserved in the rural community of Ampasimpotsy, located in the Tsiroanomandidy Health District of Madagascar. Periodic, monthly overland transport of these cryopreserved isolates to the country's National Malaria Control Program laboratory in Antananarivo preceded <b>onward</b> sample <b>transfer</b> to laboratories at Case Western Reserve University, USA. There, the P. vivax isolates have been cultured through propagation in the RBCs of Saimiri boliviensis. For the four patient isolates studied to-date, the median time interval between sample collection and in vitro culture has been 454 days (range 166 to 961 days). The median time in culture, continually documented by light microscopy, has been 148 days; isolate AMP 2014. 01 was continuously propagated for 233 days. Further studies show that the P. vivax parasites propagated in Saimiri RBCs retain their ability to invade human RBCs, and can be cryopreserved, thawed and successfully returned to productive in vitro culture. Conclusions/Significance Long-term culture of P. vivax is possible in the RBCs of S. boliviensis. These studies provide an alternative to propagation of P. vivax in live animals that are becoming more restricted. In vitro culture of P. vivax in Saimiri RBCs provides an opening to stabilize patient isolates, which would serve as precious resources to apply new strategies for investigating the molecular and cellular biology of this important malaria parasit...|$|R

40|$|Methods of adoptive {{immunization}} have been employed to analyse {{the mechanisms of}} acquired immunity to leishmanial infection in the guinea pig.

Serum from convalescent animals however did augment the level of adoptive immunity expressed in recipients.

40|$|Introduction: The {{public health}} system in South Africa is a tiered system. Throughout the Western Cape are Community Health Centers (CHCs), which {{serve as the}} entry point for the {{majority}} of patients seeking medical care. Patients who require urgent or emergent treatment at the CHCs are transferred to secondary hospitals for further care. Patients requiring the highest level of care, such as specialized radiology or sub-specialist care are then transferred to a tertiary hospital. Hypothesis: Addressable limitations of basic human and technical capacities lead to preventable transfers and treatment delays for patients seeking care in this system. Methods: Over a six-week period in 2006, 270 charts from patients transferred from one of five CHCs to a secondary hospital were reviewed to uncover addressable human and technical limitations that may have led to transfer. Results: Of approximately 61950 patients seen at the CHCs during the study period 270 were transferred. 22 % (60 / 270) of these met criteria as possibly unnecessary transfers. Of these, 47 % (28 / 60) were transferred for radiograph interpretation, 23 % (14 / 60) were transferred for ultrasound, and 17 % (10 / 60) were transferred for incision and drainage. 13 % (8 / 60) were transferred {{for a variety of reasons}} but then were immediately <b>transferred</b> <b>onward</b> to a tertiary care center. Discussion: 22 % (60 / 270) of transfers could have been avoided if specific resources or training were available to CHCs or if patients requiring tertiary care were identified prior to transfer to a secondary facility. The next step will be to compare the cost of providing these resources to the savings from decreased patient transfers. We believe the techniques used in this study can serve as a model for efficiency assessment of tiered health care systems throughout South Africa and beyond...|$|R

50|$|Because of its remote location, {{the quarry}} faced a dilemma over transport.

40|$|Abstract — Many of {{the plants}} eaten by farmed {{ruminants}} are capable of being genetically modified, and may in the future be modified for nutritional, agronomic or industrial purposes. Techniques are also becoming available for genetic modification of silage and ruminal bacteria. Those working in agricultural biotechnology have a clear responsibility to detect and avoid any unintended or undesirable consequences of such modifications, whether direct or indirect, upon the animal, the consumer and the environment. One of the most general concerns that has been expressed is the possibility for <b>onward</b> <b>transfer</b> of modified gene sequences to gut microorganisms or host cells. Rare acquisition of diet-derived DNA fragments cannot be ruled out, but if this occurs, it must have also occurred throughout mammalian history.

Discussion {{of the use of}} antibiotic resistance markers in transgene constructs must take into account the wider debate on the likely impact of antibiotic use in animal agriculture on the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. There is increasing evidence that overuse of antibiotics has lead to extensive transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria from the human and animal gut.

40|$|Introduction: Within {{a trauma}} system, pre-hospital care {{is the first}} step in {{managing}} the trauma patient. Timely and appropriate transport of the injured patient to the most appropriate facility is important. Many trauma systems mandate that serious trauma cases are transported directly to a level I trauma center unless transfer to a closer hospital is deemed necessary to resuscitate and stabilize the patient prior to <b>onward</b> <b>transfer</b> to definitive care. Statistical and clinical heterogeneity is often high and is likely to be influenced by the heath care context. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare patient outcomes for patients with serious trauma transported directly to a Level I/II trauma center (‘direct’ group) to those transported to a healthcare facility before transfer to the Level I/II trauma center (‘transfer’ group). A search of bibliographic databases and secondary sources that focus on trauma was made. Studies were grouped by region: United States of America, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand and South Africa. Results: The review included 43, 554 patients from the 30 studies that met the selection criteria. Heterogeneity of the studies was high (I 2 71 %) overall but low for European, Asian, and Australian and New Zealand studies. There was considerable variation between studies in the structure, policies and practices of the respective trauma systems. The effect of “directness” on patient outcomes was inconsistent. Conclusion: The current research evidence does not support nor refute a position that all serious trauma patients be routinely transported directly to a level I/II trauma center.

40|$|Although some primary {{consumers}} such as chironomid larvae {{are known to}} exploit methane-derived carbon via microbial consortia within aquatic food webs, few studies have traced the <b>onward</b> <b>transfer</b> of such carbon to their predators. The ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus is a widespread benthivorous fish which feeds predominantly on chironomid larvae and is well adapted for foraging at lower depths than other percids. Therefore, any transfer of methanogenic carbon to higher trophic levels might be particularly evident in ruffe. We sampled ruffe and chironomid larvae from the littoral, sub-littoral and profundal areas of Jyväsjärvi, Finland, a lake which has previously been shown to contain chironomid larvae exhibiting the very low stable carbon isotope ratios indicative of methane exploitation. A combination of fish gut content examination and stable isotope {{analysis was used to}} determine trophic linkages between fish and their putative prey. Irrespective of the depth from which the ruffe were caught, their diet was dominated by chironomids and pupae although the proportions of taxa changed. Zooplankton made a negligible contribution to ruffe diet. A progressive decrease in δ 13 C and δ 15 N values with increasing water column depth was observed for both chironomid larvae and ruffe, but not for other species of benthivorous fish. Furthermore, ruffe feeding at greater depths were significantly larger than those feeding in the littoral, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in habitat use, rather than diet, as chironomids remained the predominant prey item. The outputs from isotope mixing models suggested that the incorporation of methane-derived carbon to larval chironomid biomass through feeding on methanotrophic bacteria increased at greater depth, varying from 0 % in the littoral to 28 % in the profundal. Using these outputs and the proportions of littoral, sub-littoral or profundal chironomids contributing to ruffe biomass, we estimated that 17 % of ruffe biomass in this lake was ultimately derived from chemoautotrophic sources. Methanogenic carbon thus supports considerable production of higher trophic levels in lakes...|$|E
