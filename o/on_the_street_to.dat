5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E
25|$|Abe {{had married}} in 1945 to Machi Yamada, an art student {{who led a}} career as artist and stage director, and the couple saw successes within their fields in similar time frames. Initially, however, they had lived in an old barracks within a bombed-out area of the city center. Abe sold pickles and {{charcoal}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> pay their bills. The couple joined a number of artistic study groups, such as Yoru no Kai (Group of the Night or The Night Society) and Nihon Bungaku Gakko (Japanese Literary School)'.|$|E
25|$|Mahjong {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person plays Mahjong with money: rich people play with more money, and the poor people play with less money. In all, everyone is excited and interested in playing with money.|$|E
50|$|The {{initiative}} for Eloísa Cartonera {{was taken in}} 2001 when the Argentine economy was in crisis and people went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>to</b> earn money. Among them were the so-called cartoneros, translated cardboard people, who worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>to</b> collect paper and cardboard {{as a way of}} living. In these years the culture sector found itself in a deep crisis, because books and artifacts were sold in reduced quantities.|$|R

25|$|DeLorean's {{most notable}} {{contribution}} to Pontiac was the Pontiac GTO (Gran Turismo Omologato), a muscle car {{named after the}} Ferrari 250 GTO. It evolved because of the internal GM ban on racing (January 1963) that ended the methodology which Pontiac had used to propel itself into the # 3 sales slot. Pontiac was forced to take its efforts off the track and put it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> maintain its # 3 position. The result was the GTO. The GTO debuted as a Tempest/LeMans option package with a larger, more powerful engine in 1964. This {{marked the beginning of}} Pontiac's renaissance as GM's performance division instead of its previous position as a slightly bigger Chevrolet with no clear brand identity.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} the island sequence, filming continued throughout Sicily and Italy. The sequence {{on the train}} from Castroreale to Cefalù took two days to shoot instead of the intended three hours. The scene in Messina where Sandro encounters Gloria Perkins took two days to shoot; Antononi initially wanted 400 extras for it. Only 100 turned up, so crew members recruited passers-by <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> appear in the scene. The sequence where Sandro and Claudia visit a deserted town was shot in Santa Panagia, near Catania in Sicily; buildings there were commissioned by Benito Mussolini, and were examples of fascist architecture of the Mezzogiorno. The scene where Sandro and Claudia first have sex took ten days to shoot, owing to the crew having {{to wait for a}} train to pass by every morning.|$|E
25|$|He was persecuted by {{communist}} {{authorities for}} having {{been a member of}} the AK and was refused employment for many years. Initially he worked as a free lance writer for various newspapers. However, in 1951 he lost his job due to his past membership in the Home Army. His wife was given a choice of either divorcing him, or also losing her job. She refused, and they both became unemployed. As a result, Iringh tried to support his family, even though by this time he was quite ill, by taking photographs and selling them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> passers-by. In 1956 he started to work for the Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland although he was soon once again fired on the basis of an absurd accusation that he was plotting to separate the Orava and Polish Spisz regions from Poland and join them to Czechoslovakia.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of the initial garda effort to {{disperse}} the protesters, the violence escalated. The Garda Public Order Unit was deployed and stones and metal railings – to be used for renovation work on O'Connell Street – were thrown at gardaí by protesters; as were fireworks, bricks, crude petrol bombs, and other missiles. As the rioting continued, the ranks of the rioters were swelled by many local teenagers who had not taken part in the initial protest. Several barricades were constructed from building materials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> impede the march and the gardaí. The march was due to start at 12:30, but as the violence went on the gardaí decided against trying to escort the marchers through O'Connell Street, and at about 13:30 the assembled marchers returned to the coaches that had brought them to Dublin from Northern Ireland. The three coaches were then driven to Leinster House, where a small parade was carried out, and a letter was handed to Irish Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell. They were then escorted out of the city. One of the coaches was attacked by stone throwers on the way home.|$|E
500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] was {{scheduled}} to premiere on January 31, 1993, in the time slot immediately following Super Bowl XXVII. Having consistently placed third in the Nielsen ratings during prime time since September 1992, NBC hoped a large football audience coupled with an extensive advertising campaign would allow Homicide: Life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Street</b> <b>to</b> give the network a large ratings boost. The network ran numerous television commercials advertising the premiere episode, some of which focused on the involvement of Barry Levinson {{with the hope of}} capitalizing on the feature film director's household name.|$|E
500|$|On March 28, 1942, Yasui {{deliberately}} {{broke the}} military implemented curfew in Portland, by {{walking around the}} downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm {{in order to test}} the curfew’s constitutionality. He first asked an officer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> arrest him but was told to [...] "Run along home, sonny boy," [...] and so he walked into the police station. Later, on bail, he learned that a grand jury had indicted him. After the notice was given for the Japanese to evacuate, Yasui notified the authorities that he had no intentions of complying, and went to his family's home in Hood River. This violated another law restricting travel of Japanese Americans, and authorities arrested him in Hood River.|$|E

Both Dylan and Clapton finally appeared at the soundcheck that night. Even then, Clapton was {{in the early stages of}} heroin withdrawal – only a cameraman supplying him with some methadone would result in the English guitarist taking the stage the following day, after his young girlfriend had been unsuccessful in purchasing uncut heroin for him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>To</b> Harrison's frustration, Dylan was having severe doubts about performing in such a big-event atmosphere and still would not commit to playing.

Nevertheless, NBC considered it a disappointing performance based on the amount of advertising and press coverage the episode received. [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did.|$|E
500|$|James Douglas {{illustrated}} his {{denunciation of}} The Well with {{a photograph of}} Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the [...] "severely masculine" [...] look. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style {{as a way of}} signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons– who considered Hall's style of dress [...] "rather effeminate" [...] compared to her own– said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> any woman who wore a collar and tie: [...] "Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.|$|E

2500|$|... "Sharing" [...] is also {{presented}} as a common freegan practice, associated with the anarchist idea of a [...] "gift economy". For example, Food Not Bombs recovers food that would otherwise go to waste to serve warm meals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> anyone who wants them. Really, Really Free Markets are free social events in which freegans can share goods instead of discarding them, share skills, give presents and eat food. A free store is a temporary market where people exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. In New York City, freegan.info often distributes recovered food items for free in an ad-hoc manner after trash tours.|$|E

2500|$|On September 7, 1876, the James–Younger Gang {{attempted}} to rob {{a bank in}} Northfield, Minnesota. Cole Younger and his brother Bob both later said that they selected the bank because of its connection to two former Union generals and Radical Republican politicians, Benjamin Butler and Adelbert Ames. Three of the outlaws entered the bank, as the remaining five, led by Cole Younger, remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>to</b> provide cover. The crime soon went awry, however, when the townspeople sent up the alarm and ran for their guns. Younger and his brothers began to fire {{in the air to}} clear the streets, but the townspeople (shooting from behind cover, through windows and around the corners of buildings) opened a deadly fusillade, killing gang members Clell Miller and William Chadwell and badly wounding Bob Younger through the elbow. Herb Potter rode off in a hail of bullets. The outlaws killed two townspeople, including the acting cashier of the bank, and fled empty-handed. As hundreds of Minnesotans formed posses to pursue the fleeing gang, the outlaws separated. The James brothers made it back to Missouri, but the three Youngers (Cole, Bob, and Jim) did not. They and another gang member, Charlie Pitts, waged a gun battle with a local posse in a wooded ravine along the Watonwan River west of Madelia, Minnesota. Pitts was killed, and Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger were badly wounded and captured. Cole, asked about the robbery, responded, [...] "We tried a desperate game and lost.
