5000|$|The {{sophistication and}} extent of a ramp {{metering}} system {{should be based on}} the amount of improvement desired, existing traffic conditions, installation costs, and the continuing resource requirements that are necessary to operate and maintain the system effectively. The simplest form of control is a fixed time operation. It performs the basic functions of breaking up platoons into single-vehicle entries and setting an upper limit on the flow rates that enter the freeway. Presence and passage detectors may be installed on the ramp to actuate and terminate the metering cycles, but the metering rate is based on average traffic conditions at a particular ramp at a particular time. This type of operation provides the benefits associated with accident reductions, but is not as effective in regulating freeway volumes because there is no input about mainline traffic. Pre-timed control can be implemented on any number of ramps, and is often implemented as an initial <b>operating</b> <b>strategy</b> until individual ramps can be incorporated into a traffic responsive system. The next level of control, traffic responsive, establishes metering rates based on actual freeway conditions. The local traffic responsive approach utilizes detectors and a micro-processor to determine the mainline flow in the immediate vicinity of the ramp and the ramp demand to select an appropriate metering rate. Traffic responsive control also permits ramp metering to be used to help manage demand when incidents occur on the freeway, i.e. reduce the metering rate at ramps upstream of the incident and increase the rate at ramps downstream. System-wide control is a form of traffic responsive control but operates on the basis of total freeway conditions. Centralized computer controlled systems can handle numerous ramps in a traffic responsive scheme and feature multiple control programs and overrides. Control strategies can also be distributed among individual ramps. A significant feature of system control is interconnection that permits the metering rate at any ramp to be influenced by conditions at other locations. Denver showed that this type of control has significant benefits when properly applied.’ ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{micro grid}} (MG) needs a {{suitable}} <b>operating</b> <b>strategy</b> {{to maintain its}} operation stably. However, {{the development of an}} <b>operating</b> <b>strategy</b> for a MG depends deeply on the type and number of distributed generation sources (DGSs). For this reason, this work develops four operating strategies for a MG with one or multi DGSs. The DGSs in MGs can be sustained energy sources (SESs) or intermittent energy sources (IESs). The proposed operating strategies can be used to maintain the stability of MGs effectively. To examine the practicability of these operating strategies, a sample MG is employed and is simulated via computer software. The important simulation results are presented and discussed in this paper.
