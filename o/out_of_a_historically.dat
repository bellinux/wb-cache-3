40|$|This book {{is closed}} access. This book explores the 'Black Horror' {{campaign}} {{as an important}} chapter in the popularisation of racialised discourse in European history. Originating in early 1920 s Germany, this international racist campaign was promoted through modern media, targeting French occupation troops from colonial Africa on German soil and using stereotypical images of 'racially primitive', sexually depraved black soldiers threatening and raping 'white women' in 1920 s Germany to generate widespread public concern about their presence. The campaign became an international phenomenon in Post-WWI Europe, and had followers throughout Europe, the US and Australia. Wigger examines the campaign's combination of race, gender, nation and class as categories of social inclusion and exclusion, {{which led to the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> racist conglomerate <b>of</b> interlinked discriminations. Her book offers readers a rare insight into a widely forgotten chapter of popular racism in Europe, and sets <b>out</b> the benefits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> reflexive study <b>of</b> racialised discourse and its intersectionality...|$|R
40|$|IFR) traffic, Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{must rely}} on pilots to use charted airport {{sketches}} and diagrams as well as standard instrument departures (SIDs) and obstacle departure procedures (ODPs). While many charted (and uncharted) departures are based on radar vectors, the bulk of IFR departures in the NAS require pilots to navigate <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the terminal environment to the en route phase. IFR takeoffs and departures are fast-paced phases of flight, and pilots often are overloaded with critical flight information. During takeoff, pilots are busy requesting and receiving clearances, preparing their aircraft for departure, and taxiing to the active runway. During IFR conditions, they are doing this with minimal visibility, {{and they may be}} without constant radio communication if flying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-towered airport. <b>Historically,</b> takeoff minimums for commercial operations have been successively reduced through <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> improved signage, runway markings and lighting aids, and concentrated pilot training and qualifications. Today at major terminals, some commercial operators with appropriate equipment, pilot qualifications, and approved Operations Specifications (OpsSpecs) may takeoff with visibility as low as runway visual range (RVR) 3, or 300 feet runway visual range. One of the consequences of takeoffs with reduced visibility is that pilots are challenged in maintaining situational awareness during taxi operations. SURFACE MOVEMENT SAFETY One of the biggest safety concerns in aviation is the surface movement accident. As a direct result, the FAA has rapidly expanded the information available to pilots including the addition of taxiway and runway information in FAA publications, particularly the IFR U. S. Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklets and Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) volumes. The FAA has also implemented new procedures and created educational and awareness programs for pilots, air traffic controllers, and ground operators. By focusing resources to attack this problem head on, the FAA hopes to reduce and eventually eliminate surface movement accidents.
