40|$|Background Studies {{from the}} UK {{have shown that}} {{children}} with Down syndrome acquire more academic skills in regular education. Does this likewise hold true for the Dutch situation, even after the effect of selective placement has been taken into account? Method In 2006, an extensive questionnaire was sent to 160 parents of (specially and regularly placed) children with Down syndrome (born 19932000) in primary education in the Netherlands with {{a response rate of}} 76 %. Questions were related to the child's school history, academic and non-academic skills, intelligence quotient, parental educational level, the extent to which parents worked <b>on</b> <b>academics</b> with their child at home, and the amount of academic instructional time at school. Academic skills were predicted with the other variables as independents. Results For the children in regular schools much more time proved to be spent <b>on</b> <b>academics.</b> Academic performance appeared to be predicted reasonably well on the basis of age, non-academic skills, parental educational level {{and the extent to which}} parents worked at home <b>on</b> <b>academics.</b> However, more variance could be predicted when the total amount of years that the child spent in regular education was added, especially regarding reading and to a lesser extent regarding writing and math. In addition, we could prove that this finding could not be accounted for by endogenity. Conclusion Regularly placed children with Down syndrome learn more academics. However, this is not a straight consequence of inclusive placement and age alone, but is also determined by factors such as cognitive functioning, non-academic skills, parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home <b>on</b> <b>academics.</b> Nevertheless, it could be proven that the more advanced academic skills of the regularly placed children are not only due to selective placement. The positive effect of regular school <b>on</b> <b>academics</b> appeared to be most pronounced for reading skills...|$|R

The study used a combination of data, comparing their cumulative grade point average with survey results asking about {{their perception of the}} effect library employment had <b>on</b> their <b>academics.</b> The overwhelming majority of students felt that library employment had a positive impact <b>on</b> their <b>academics</b> and this perception was confirmed by their collective, average GPAs when compared to that of their peers. This research expands the knowledge not only in the potential impact of place <b>on</b> <b>academics</b> but also in how college libraries perceive their impact upon student employees and the benefits of such employment...|$|R

5|$|By 1955, Phoenix's Jewish {{population}} {{had grown to}} over 3,000 families, and the city still had two Jewish congregations, Beth Israel and Beth El. That year, {{with the support of}} Krohn, Albert Plotkin joined Beth Israel as rabbi. Born in 1920 and raised in South Bend, Indiana, his parents were immigrants from Russia. After getting an undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame, he entered Hebrew Union College in 1943 – <b>on</b> <b>academic</b> probation, because he had taken no Hebrew at Notre Dame. He was ordained by Hebrew Union College in 1948, graduating with a Master of Hebrew Letters. Plotkin had started his rabbinic career as assistant rabbi of Temple De Hirsch in Seattle, his first pulpit after ordination. There he met his future wife Sylvia Pincus, whose family were long-time members of Temple De Hirsch. They married a year later, and shortly after moved to Spokane, Washington, where Plotkin became senior rabbi at Temple Emanuel.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the Inns of Court Regiment. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With {{the help of the}} cricketer Pelham Warner, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling Zeppelin attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with dysentery, possibly cholera and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing football at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at Caius College, Cambridge, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>academic</b> interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between recruiting intensity, academic performance, and time management skills of NCAA Division I basketball players.
