5|$|The road <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> {{hit by a}} small bomb {{during the}} Second World War, but the cinema (which was showing several films at the time) survived with only minor damage. After the war, {{television}} led {{to a decline in}} cinema attendances, and by 1965, only 40cinemas remained in Manchester. Cine City closed in July 2001, making it the third-longest running cinema in England.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most major}} cities, Montreal needs easy highway access from its suburbs and {{surrounding}} areas. However, because Montreal {{was built on}} an island surrounded by three rivers, it can be entered by land only on a bridge or through a tunnel. Although the city was founded in 1642, it was not before 1847 that the first fixed link to the <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> established when a wooden bridge was built across Rivière des Prairies to Île Jésus, {{on the site of}} what is now Ahuntsic Bridge. Another bridge was built immediately afterward, a few kilometers west, which became Lachapelle Bridge, and another in 1849, Pont des Saints-Anges, to the east. The latter bridge collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – kissed the Queen's hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood {{when he and his}} brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines into position, or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel, and then hot coal tar coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was lowered into position, taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to lift them. The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E

25|$|According to Apollodorus of Artemita, {{quoted by}} Strabo, the Indo-Greek {{territory}} {{for a while}} included the Indian coastal provinces of Sindh and possibly Gujarat. With archaeological methods, the Indo-Greek territory can however only be confirmed from the Kabul Valley to the eastern Punjab, so Greek presence <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> probably short-lived or less significant.|$|E

25|$|She patronised the Huguenot {{sculptor}} Le Sueur, and she {{was responsible}} for the lavish creation of her famous chapel, that, although plain on the <b>outside,</b> <b>was</b> beautifully crafted inside with gold and silver reliquaries, paintings, statues, a chapel garden and a magnificent altarpiece by Rubens. It also had an unusual monstrance, designed by François Dieussart to exhibit the Holy Sacrament.|$|E
25|$|Sandstone {{was used}} as the primary {{building}} material for the cathedral. The inside was plastered white under the Archbishop Bardo, probably {{in the middle of the}} 10th century. During renovations ordered by Henry IV in the late 11th century, much of the <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> also plastered, but the cornices were left exposed in their original red and yellow. It is believed that the coloring of the cathedral was changed more times, but no further documentation of the coloring is available until record of the Baroque works.|$|E
25|$|Coracles in Iraq {{are called}} quffa. Their history {{goes back to}} antiquity where they appear on {{sculptured}} panels in Assyrian palaces constructed between 700 and 900 BC. These panels {{are now in the}} British Museum. Herodotus visited Babylon in the 5th century BC, and wrote a long description of the coracles he encountered there. Traditionally, quffa were framed with willow or juniper and covered with hides. The <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> coated with hot bitumen for waterproofing. These coracles have been in use, at least until recently, around Baghdad and on the Tigris. Some of the Iraq coracles are very large.|$|E

25|$|On the {{following}} day at 7:15a.m., Borel arrived {{at the home of}} his friend Alan Guillemette. When Guillemette's mother opened the door Eric asked her to wake him. The two had a lengthy discussion in the garden, and apparently Eric wanted something from Guillemette, but when he declined and turned {{to go back into the}} house, Eric shot him in the back, mortally wounding him. From 7:30a.m. onwards, Borel started shooting people at random. No one grew suspicious of his rifle until he started his rampage, since it was hunting season and the sight of rifles <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> to be expected.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} freewheels. A freewheel, as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two freewheels, one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the <b>outside</b> <b>was</b> permitted to rotate faster by its freewheel. Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the freewheels.|$|E
