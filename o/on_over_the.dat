5|$|A small plaque erected by the Datchet Parish Council in 2000 is {{the only}} {{reminder}} of the Divided Bridge. Datchet High Street which once continued <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bridge to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Harrison {{built his}} first chronometer, which he {{steadily}} improved <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next thirty years before submitting it for examination.

5|$|Just before half time, a try by Newport's Jack Wetter was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries.|$|E

25|$|Weighted boots {{of several}} styles {{may be used}} if the diver will be working heavy.

These weights give the diver better {{stability}} when working upright on the bottom, which can significantly improve productivity for some kinds of work.|$|E

25|$|The diver {{and tender}} {{on the surface}} are {{connected}} by a rope lifeline and harness. The harness is typically put <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even {{if he or she}} must remove the air cylinder or buoyancy control device. The harness fits over the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back to the hole. The harness should not be able to slide up or down the diver's torso when pulled in line with the body.|$|E

25|$|On 30 September 2008, the London Fire Brigade {{announced}} {{the conclusion of}} the investigation into the fire at a press conference at New Scotland Yard. The painstaking investigation was conducted by the Fire Brigade, along with London's Metropolitan Police Service, Forensic Science Services, and electrical examination experts Dr. Burgoyne's & Partners. They said that the most likely cause was the failure of an industrial vacuum cleaner that may have been left switched <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> weekend before the fire started. The report revealed no evidence that the ship was subjected to arson attack and concluded that the fire started accidentally.|$|E
25|$|The scene dissolves into Queens High School where Peter Parker is {{presenting}} an oral report on Arachne. His questions prompt {{the teacher to}} assign the entire class a ten-page report, which they must work <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> weekend. As revenge, Flash Thompson and the other bullies at the school begin to physically and verbally abuse Peter ("Bullying by Numbers"). He walks home beaten and alone, until he runs into his next door neighbor, crush, and Flash's girlfriend, Mary Jane. They each go into their separate homes and have arguments with their guardians: Mary Jane's father tries to beat her, while Peter feels his Uncle Ben is trying to replace his dead father. Both teenagers long for escape ("No More").|$|E
25|$|The Kangaroos {{never forgot}} the {{territory}} that {{started it all}} and worked in Canada off and <b>on</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years.

The Fabulous Kangaroos’ 1965 run in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{turned out to be}} the last time the original Kangaroos teamed together. In June 1965, the Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States at least for a while longer.|$|E
