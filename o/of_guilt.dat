Later, however, she suffers pangs <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> for her part in the crime, which drives her to sleepwalk. She dies off-stage in the last act, an apparent suicide.|$|E

5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E

5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E
5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja {{later wrote}} that he {{intended}} the novel {{to deal with the}} question of the existence of God. Mahayana et al. agree, noting that the theme of faith– a theme unknown in modern Indonesian literature at the time– is found throughout the novel. Maier notes that the psychological concepts <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> fear, and remorse drive the novel. Teeuw describes the work as taking up the classic theme of modernity versus tradition in a new, more worldly manner. Balfas writes that this approach to the theme was soon followed by other writers.|$|E

5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|The Sector General series {{began as}} short stories {{published}} in New Worlds from 1957 onwards. Originally White intended {{to end the}} series with Star Healer (1985), by which time the central characters had reached the top levels in their careers, but Ballantine Books persuaded him to continue. He extended the stories' range by introducing new central characters beginning with Code Blue - Emergency (1987), and The Genocidal Healer (1992) focused on psychological and theological issues <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> and forgiveness rather than strictly medical ones.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we examine {{feelings}} <b>of</b> group-based <b>guilt</b> among Portuguese people {{in relation to the}} Portuguese colonial war, and their consequences for social behaviour. Specifically, we focus on the way Portuguese university students identify with their national group and the outgroup and their feelings <b>of</b> group-based <b>guilt</b> regarding their group’s past misdeeds during the colonial period. The consequences <b>of</b> group-based <b>guilt</b> are also analyzed. 130 Portuguese university students answered a questionnaire and results show that students feel low levels <b>of</b> group-based <b>guilt</b> in relation to this period. Our results show that ingroup glorification is positively related with the use of cognitions to justify the ingroup’s behaviour, presumably to avoid responsibility for the harm committed by the ingroup. Outgroup identification correlates with compensatory behavioural intentions and openness to negative information about the colonial war. As expected, feelings <b>of</b> group-based <b>guilt</b> show a significant correlation with compensatory behavioural intentions. Links between political orientation, ingroup attachment and glorification, exonerating cognitions and group-based guilt are analyzed and their implications for intergroup relations are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{cross-examination}} of him {{and other}} witnesses by Birkett swayed the jury, and they took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse {{admitted that he had}} in fact committed the murder– although he never gave a reason– it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission <b>of</b> <b>guilt</b> the identity of the victim has never been discovered.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} avenues of appeal {{available}} to the Bali Nine. Lawyers had seven days post-sentencing to lodge appeals.

All appealed to overturn their sentence. The sentences of Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after appeal.

5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v.

In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign <b>of</b> <b>guilt,</b> and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, with the players auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|For decades afterward, Jennings {{repeatedly}} {{admitted that}} he felt responsible for the crash that killed Buddy Holly.

Jennings sang The Stage, {{a tribute to the}} Day the Music Died. He recreated the concert performers on February 2, 1959, in order at the Surf Ballroom, starting with Eddie Cochran, then Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper and, finally, Buddy Holly.

He would be persuaded, if Henderson swung for it, adhering to his statement. Such were Mr. Brace’s theories of evidence. He added that he was not fully persuaded that there was any hell to go to, yet probably he scrupled not to preach ‘tidings of damnation.’ He wanted to be more certain <b>of</b> Gowrie’s <b>guilt,</b> than he was that there is hell-fire. ‘Spiteful taunts’ followed, Mar’s repartee to the argument about hell being obvious.

Results indicate that there is a relationship between the experience <b>of</b> collective <b>guilt</b> and the intention to repair.
