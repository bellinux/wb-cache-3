50|$|Orthodontia is the {{specialty}} of dentistry that {{is concerned with}} the treatment of improper bites and crooked teeth. Orthodontic treatment can help fix the patient's teeth and set them in the right place. Orthodontists usually use braces and clear aligners to set the patient's teeth. Orthodontists work on reconstructing the entire face rather than focusing only on teeth. After a course of active orthodontic treatment, patients will typically wear retainers (<b>orthodontic</b> <b>devices),</b> which help to maintain the teeth in their improved positions while surrounding bone reforms around them. The retainers are generally worn full-time for a period, anywhere from just a few days to a year, then part-time (typically, nightly during sleep) {{for as long as the}} orthodontist recommends. It is possible for the teeth to stay aligned without regular retainer wear. However, there are many reasons teeth will crowd as a person ages, whether or not the individual ever experienced orthodontic treatment; thus there is no guarantee that teeth will stay aligned without retention. For this reason, many orthodontists prescribe night-time or part-time retainer wear for many years after orthodontic treatment (potentially for life). Adult orthodontic patients are more likely to need lifetime retention.|$|E

Besides the fact that it allows breastfeeding, it has a significant orthodontic effect, too. Conclusion. Specificity of this device is the lack of extraoral fixation.

30|$|Beacause of many {{drawbacks}} and questionable {{effects of}} conventional palatal expander {{that are either}} tooth-borne or tooth-and-tissue-borne, the bone-borne maxillary distractors {{have been developed to}} deliver the expansion force directly to the basal bone and to overcome the dental complications.

30|$|SARPE was {{traditionally}} {{performed with}} the use of tooth-borne <b>orthodontic</b> <b>devices</b> (Hyrax type, Haas type). Force from the Hyrax expansion screw applied to the molars and premolars results not in a parallel but rather a tipping movement of the right and left maxilla. Additionally, root resorption, gingival recession and pathologic loss of buccal cortical bone and the anchorage teeth can occur. The dental anchorage quality may also be reduced if the maxillary sinus extends far downwards, and there are missing teeth or periodontitis [7, 8].|$|E
30|$|Invisible <b>orthodontic</b> <b>devices</b> are not {{comparable}} to OA that {{are commonly used}} in TMD patients, because they are neither rigid as a conventional appliance nor soft as over-the-counter devices [6].

A basic strategy to get deeper into the issue should be to gather data on passive invisible devices first (i.e., retainers).|$|E

This study included 30 children 5 to 12 years old (9. 1 ± 1. 7 years old) who were users of removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>devices</b> for at least 6 months and 30 control children of similar ages (7. 7 ± 1. 5 years old). The presence of yeast species in the saliva was evaluated by microbiological methods. Candida species were identified using phenotypic methods.

No statistically significant differences were observed for saliva yeast counts and anti-C. albicans IgA levels between the studied groups. Children with <b>orthodontic</b> <b>devices</b> exhibited more yeast cells adhering to oral epithelial cells and {{a higher percentage of}} non-albicans species relative to the control group.

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the microbial level of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. during an orthodontic treatment, and compare the data with untreated control subjects. Sixty young adult subjects were selected (average 20. 5, DS 1. 62), among which 40 underwent an orthodontic treatment (20 were treated with self-ligating brackets and 20 with conventional brackets) and 20 were controls. Plaque Index, salivary flow and buffering capacity of saliva were assessed {{before the beginning of}} the orthodontic treatment. Then the microbial counts were obtained by using an in-office bacteria test. The plaque index (PI) increased over time in each group as well as salivary flow, mostly in subjects treated with self-ligating brackets, suggesting a difference between conventional and self-ligating brackets. S. mutans showed a different trend of colonization in the two treated groups, as for subjects treated with conventional brackets it showed the greater value at the early stage of treatment (T 1), followed by a decrease at T 2. Lactobacillus spp. showed significant increase over time in the two treated groups, respect to the control group.

Methods: Forty bovine dentin specimens were infected intraorally using a removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>device</b> in order to induce the biofilm colonization of the dentin. Then, the samples were treated with the medications for 7 days. Saline solution was used as the control. Two evaluations were performed: immediately after the elimination of the medication and after incubation in brain-heart infusion medium for 24 hours. The Live/Dead technique (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) and a confocal microscope were used to obtain the percentage of live cells. Nonparametric statistical tests were performed to show differences in the percentage of live cells among the groups (P <. 05). Results: Calcium hydroxide and 2 % chlorhexidine gel did not show statistical differences in the immediate evaluation. However, after application of the brain-heart infusion medium for 24 hours, 2 % gel chlorhexidine showed a statistically lesser percentage of live cells in comparison with calcium hydroxide. The triantibiotic paste significantly showed a lower percentage of live cells in comparison with the 2 % chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide groups in the immediate and secondary (after 24 hours) evaluations.

Methods: Sixty orthodontic patients were randomly assigned to two groups: GA (ages 12 - 25 years; mean 17. 1 years) was the control, and GB (ages 12 - 26 years; mean 17. 9 years) the intervention group. All patients received elastomeric separators on the mesial and distal surfaces of one of the lower first molars, and immediately after insertion of the separators received irradiation as randomly indicated. the intervention group (GB) received irradiation with LLLT (aluminum gallium arsenide diode), by a single spot in the region of the radicular apex at a dose of 2 J/cm(2) and application along the radicular axis of the buccal surface with three spots of 1 J/cm(2) (wavelength 830 nm; infrared). Control group (GA) received irradiation with a placebo light in the same way. This was a double-blind study. All the patients received a questionnaire to be filled out at home describing their levels of pain 2, 6, and 24 h and 3 and 5 days after orthodontic separator placement, in situations of relaxed and occluded mouth. Results: the patients in the intervention group (LLLT) had lower mean pain scores in all the measures. the incidence of complete absence of pain (score = 0) was significantly higher the intervention group.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the biofilm dissolution and cleaning ability of different irrigant solutions on intraorally infected dentin. Methods: One hundred twenty bovine dentin specimens were infected intraorally by using a removable <b>orthodontic</b> <b>device.</b> Thirty samples were used for each irrigant solution: 2 % chlorhexidine and 1 %, 2. 5 %, and 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). The solutions were used for 5, 15, and 30 minutes and at 2 experimental volumes, 500 mu L and 1 mL. The samples were stained by using acridine orange dye before and after the experiments and evaluated by using a confocal microscope. The percentage of biofilm, isolated cells, and noncolonized dentin was measured by using a grid system. Differences in the reduction or increase of the studied parameters were assessed by using nonparametric methods (P <. 05). Results: The higher values of biofilm dissolution and noncolonized dentin were found in the 30 -minute NaOCl group and in the 5 -minute and 15 -minute groups of 5. 25 % NaOCL. The use of 2 % chlorhexidine solution did not improve the biofilm dissolution or increase the cleaning of the dentin in comparison with the NaOCl solutions (P <. 05). Conclusions: Two percent chlorhexidine does not dissolve the biofilms. Thirty minutes of NaOCl are necessary to have higher values of biofilm dissolution and to increase the cleaning of the dentin independently of the concentration in comparison with the 5 -minute and 15 -minute contact times.
