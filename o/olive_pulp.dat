The net electrical energy available from OME is then calculated as a difference between gross energy available and energy consumed for stabilization. The gross available electrical energy was calculated based on direct energy conversion of the stabilized feedstock on a small scale direct combustion and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbine.

40|$|Bruising, {{damage caused}} by impact on the fruit during harvesting, is a major {{limiting}} factor {{in the production of}} table olives and currently restricts the applicability of mechanical harvesting. Bruising is characterized by darkening of the olive fruit surface and softening of the mesocarp or pulp. It decreases final product quality and may cause consumer rejection. This paper describes and quantifies anatomical changes in the <b>olive</b> mesocarp (<b>pulp)</b> related to bruising in fresh olive fruits after an induced impact. The study assessed two harvested table olive cultivars differing in bruise susceptibility (‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ and ‘Hojiblanca’) at two different times (4 and 24 h after induced impact). Qualitative observations of tissue bruising prior and after histological analysis revealed changes in the damaged mesocarp including ruptured cells, loss of cell wall thickness, and discoloration in the damaged areas. These changes appeared greater in ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ than ‘Hojiblanca’, and more evident 24 h after the impact. Bruising damage was quantified using eleven parameters related to the area of the damaged zone, and incidence and position of tissue ruptures. Nine of these parameters changed significantly with time, and significant differences were observed between the two cultivars studied in seven of the parameters. Three of these, the total damaged area (TDA) measured in mesocarp portions prior to histological procedure, the number of tissue ruptures in the mesocarp intersected by circumferential arc 2 (located at one-fourth of the pulp thickness from the fruit exterior; Brk-arc 2), and the distance from the fruit exterior) to the first found tissue rupture (D-min)), measured in histological preparations, were the most discriminating and easy to assess parameters, and are thus recommended for the evaluation of susceptibility to bruising among harvested table olive cultivars.

This is mostly due to insufficient knowledge on the beneficial properties of these wastes. Land filling and incineration were the foremost cheapest options put forward by scientists to reduce the large volumes of solid wastes (Singh and Agrawal 2008). Recently, composting and vermi-composting have been gaining grounds as a better management option for these wastes because of their better NPK value (Singh et al. 2011 a, b). These two processes add value and also cut down {{the volume of}} waste, making their land application easier (Yusri et al. 1995; Singh et al. 2011 a, b). Majority of the studies indicated that crop production has benefitted from land application of organic residues due to the possibility of recycling of organic matter, N, P, and other plant nutrients (AdeOluwa and Adeoye 2008; Silva et al. 2010; Singh and Agrawal 2007, 2009, 2010 a, b, c).

We studied nutrient distribution in the soil profile following fertigation with different doses of N-P-K fertilizer, and its effect on nutrient concentrations, yield and both table olive and oil quality. Measurements were performed in an adult 'Manzanilla de Sevilla' olive orchard in which 100, 200 and 400 g N per tree and irrigation period of a 4 N- 1 P- 3 K fertilizer were applied by fertigation from 1999 to 2001 (three growing seasons) and 200, 400 and 600 g N of the same fertilizer were applied in the two following growing seasons (2002 - 2003). A control treatment, irrigation without fertilizer, was also established. Irrigation amounts were similar in all treatments. In 2003, NO 3 -N, P and K concentrations in the root zone wetted by irrigation were studied: they increased with respect to those in the drying zone, showing a general linear relationship with fertilizer dose, particularly in the top soil layer where most of the olive roots were active. In the 600 g N treatment, leaching losses were observed at 0. 8 - 0. 9 m depth, possibly leading to groundwater contamination. We found an increase in fruit yield with increasing fertilizer dose, likely due to the observed greater concentrations of NO 3 -N, P and K in the soil. In fact, our data show a positive relationship between increased soil NO 3 -N, P and K availability and higher leaf N, P, K concentrations. This could have accounted for the observed increase in canopy volume, fruit number per tree and fruit weight with the amount of fertilizer. Despite the fact that fruit weight, pulp/stone ratio and volume increased with fertilizer dose, reducing sugars, necessary for <b>olive</b> fermentation, and <b>pulp</b> texture decreased. Differences in texture remained after 'Spanish-style' green olive processing.

Feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG), feed efficiency (FE), energy intake (EI), energy efficiency (EE), protein intake (PI), protein efficiency (PE), feed cost per kg live weight (FC/kg), and production index (IP) were determined. There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between broilers fed the OP diets and the control diets for all parameters. Processed OP improved FE (p≤ 0. 019 from 1 - 21 days; p≤ 0. 005 from 22 - 42 days; and p≤ 0. 008 from 1 - 42 days of age) and EE (p≤ 0. 012 from 1 - 21 days; p≤ 0. 012 from 22 - 42 days; and p≤ 0. 002 from 1 - 42 days of age). The enzyme blend supplementation did not influence (p> 0. 05) any of the studied variables. The inclusion of OP in the diets at levels up to 100 g/kg would does not have deleterious effects on broiler production performance...|$|E
30|$|The {{procedure}} of phenolic compounds extraction from olive fruit {{is based on}} the method of Brenes [10], with some changes. <b>Olive</b> <b>pulp</b> (10  g) is mixed with 30  ml of methanol: water 80 / 20 (v/v). The mixture was centrifuged for 5  min at 3500  rpm and then filtered. This extraction was repeated three times. The extracts are collected after evaporation of the organic solvent. Phenolic compounds are extracted with ethyl acetate (5  ×  20  ml). The extraction of oil polyphenols is performed with methanol according to the method of Vázquez-Roncero [11]. The assay of total polyphenols {{is based on the}} reduction of phosphomolybdic acid of Folin Ciocalteu agent by polyphenols in alkaline medium [12].|$|E
40|$|Aim of this research, {{within the}} UE BIOTROLL Project, was the {{physical}} and chemical characteriza-tion of the <b>olive</b> <b>pulp</b> (OP) and of the effluents arising from the biological treatment {{for the production of}} hydrogen (EH 2) and methane (ECH 4) and the agricultural reuse of these products for soil fertilization. Preliminary results showed that they contain respectively 28. 4 %, 7. 8 % and 4. 6 % of dry matter; around 60 % of organic carbon; appreciable amount of macro- (especially organic N and K 2 O) and micronutrients and negligible amount of heavy metals. pH and electrical conductivity are in a normal range. Their addi-tion to a sandy soil showed different intensity of mineralization processes, any phytotoxicity phenomenon and a significant bio-stimulant effect on wheat seed germination...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of pasteurization temperature {{and time of}} treatment on the flesh firmness {{and the evolution of}} microbial communities was studied for table olives Cv. Nocellara del Belice, packed in glass jars and processed with a tunnel pasteurizer. Pasteurization at industrial scale was carried out within a tunnel pasteurizer applying the treatment at 75 °C for 8 min in the thermal center of the jars. Besides flesh firmness and microbial evolutions, pH, total ti-tratable acidity (TTA) and colour were evaluated for the table olives during storage at 6, 12 and 15 months from packing. Table olives showed a high stability and an acceptable flesh firmness for the entire period under observation. Specifically, <b>olive</b> <b>pulp</b> texture decreased during the storage period, but the softening was most evident in the deeper layers of the pulp. The results indicated that the storage period should not exceed 6 months; although the hygiene is preserved, after this period the firmness might compromise the acceptability by consumer...|$|E
