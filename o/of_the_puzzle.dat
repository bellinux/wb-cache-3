5|$|Inglenook Sidings is {{an award-winning}} model railway train {{shunting}} puzzle created by Alan Wright for the Manchester Model Railway Society's 1978 show, {{based on the}} former Kilham Sidings on the Alnwick and Cornhill Railway. The aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> {{is to create a}} train consisting of five of the eight wagons sitting in the sidings, in the order in which the wagons are randomly selected.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> laid out.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
40|$|When {{decision}} situations involve infinities, vexing puzzles arise. We describe six such <b>puzzles</b> below. (None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> has a {{universally accepted}} solution, {{and we are}} aware of no suggested solutions that apply to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles.)</b> We will use <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> to motivate two theses concerning infinite decisions.

5|$|The {{expansion}} contains quests and puzzles {{that the}} player must solve. There are {{different ways to}} complete quests, all with their own pitfalls. Peaceful resolutions {{can be made with}} characters and factions, though these can have ill effects, such as releasing secrets or worsening relations with other factions. Violent completion of quests may be faster, though they can result in the weakening of alliances between the player and the factions. In some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> sections, the player directs lasers to hit designated targets; others require the player to build with blocks, as in Minecraft. Puzzle sections were not featured in the base game. Upon completion of quests, the assisted factions reward the protagonist with Nuka-Cola bottle caps, one of the fictional currencies found throughout the Fallout series. The player character also gains experience points. Some of the quests include investigating minor mysteries, retrieving missing items, solving disagreements, and clearing out monster-infested areas.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> game Puyo Puyo {{and replaces}} {{all of its}} {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E
5|$|Locating the armillary {{building}} in Egypt {{with the three}} stone keys, George and Nico sneak into the building, only to see Susarro forcing Bruno to activate the armillary. As it powers up, George and Nico subdue Susarro, just before Petra arrives with a hooded man seen twice before during their adventure, who proceeds to kill Susarro with supernatural powers. The figure {{turns out to be}} the Grand Master of the Neo-Templars, thought to have been killed back in Bannockburn, but had survived, having Petra work with Susarro until he learnt what the Grand Master needed. With the armillary active and the location of a large power site displayed, the Grand Master sets off dynamite in the building as he escapes with Petra, trapping George, Nico, and Bruno inside and killing Flap. The group find the only way for them to escape is for one of them to sacrifice themselves in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> rooms, forcing Bruno to take the responsibility, hoping to atone for past sins so that George and Nico can stop the Grand Master.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} system capable of {{automatically}} solving combinatorial logic puzzles given in (simplified) English. It involves translating <b>the</b> English descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> into answer set programming(ASP) and using ASP solvers to provide solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles.</b> To translate <b>the</b> descriptions, {{we use a}} lambda-calculus based approach using Probabilistic Combinatorial Categorial Grammars (PCCG) where <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> words are associated with parameters {{to be able to}} distinguish between multiple meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same word. Meaning of many words and the parameters are learned. <b>The</b> <b>puzzles</b> are represented in ASP using an ontology which is applicable to a large set of logic puzzles...|$|R

5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{language}} acquisition {{is to improve}} native-like proficiency in vocabulary use. One solution to this is to identify word frequencies (especially in conjunction with core vocabulary) and collocation patterns based on native speakers discourse. In this paper, I first discuss some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> presented in some long-standing and recent quantitative observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mandarin lexicon.

25|$|Clearly each {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} resolve some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).|$|E
25|$|Other Rubik's Cube {{modifications}} include cubes {{that have}} been extended or truncated {{to form a new}} shape. An example of this is the Trabjer's Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3×3. Most shape mods can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of Tony Fisher's Rhombic Dodecahedron, there are 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, and 6×6 versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{algorithms}} {{are designed}} to transform {{only a small part}} of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved, so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for cycling three corners without changing the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> or flipping the orientation of a pair of edges while leaving the others intact.|$|E

25|$|Rubik's Brand Ltd. {{also holds}} the {{registered}} trademarks {{for the word}} Rubik and Rubik's and for the 2D and 3D visualisations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b> The trademarks have been upheld by a ruling of the General Court of the European Union on 25 November 2014 in a successful defence against a German toy manufacturer seeking to invalidate them. However, European toy manufacturers are allowed to create differently shaped puzzles that have a similar rotating or twisting functionality of component parts such as for example Skewb, Pyraminx or Impossiball.|$|E
25|$|Some {{algorithms}} do have {{a certain}} desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing {{other parts of the}} cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side-effects, and are employed early on in the solution when most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> has not yet been solved and the side-effects are not important. Most are long and difficult to memorise. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem is}} how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's neurons to fire and muscles to contract.

25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> of motivation.|$|E
25|$|An acrostic {{is a type}} of word puzzle, in eponymous acrostic form, that {{typically}} consists of two parts. The first is a set of lettered clues, each of which has numbered blanks representing the letters of the answer. The second part is a long series of numbered blanks and spaces, representing a quotation or other text, into which the answers for the clues fit. In most forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> the first letters of each correct clue answer, read in order from clue A on down the list, will spell out the author of the quote and the title of the work it is taken from; this can be used as an additional solving aid.|$|E
25|$|There are six central pieces {{which show}} one {{coloured}} face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, {{but not all}} combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are {{on opposite sides of}} the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.|$|E
2500|$|Evan Dickens of Adventure Gamers stated, [...] "The Dig is a {{lot more}} {{reminiscent}} of Myst than any other LucasArts adventure." [...] He said the game was a bit too difficult, with very challenging puzzles. A Next Generation similarly said that <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> were generally more frustrating than in other LucasArts games, citing as an example a door <b>puzzle</b> for which <b>the</b> clues [...] "are so confusingly drawn" [...] that the player ultimately must use trial and error. GameSpot's Jeffrey Adam Young agreed, saying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles,</b> [...] "some follow logic, others just call for trial and error, and yet others will leave you clueless". A reviewer for Maximum disagreed, saying that [...] "with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> one or two that were just too obscure, [...] set at just the right level to keep a serious adventure freak riveted (and not too hacked off)." [...] Joshua Roberts <b>of</b> Allgame praised <b>the</b> <b>puzzles,</b> saying there were [...] "only a few real brain twisters" [...] and that most could be solved with patience and consideration. [...] Bernard H. Yee of PC Magazine said that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> were [...] "a bit more frustrating than others".|$|R
50|$|All {{three games}} are {{characterized}} by a quite innovative inventory system. It is notable for <b>the</b> variety <b>of</b> allowed physical actions you could subject the items to, especially <b>the</b> great freedom <b>of</b> dropping and picking up objects, which was used for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>puzzles.</b> In general, <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> in <b>the</b> series are based on experimenting with inventory items, combining them or depositing them in the correct places.|$|R
25|$|The Rhagophthalmidae are a glow-worm-like {{lineage of}} Elateroidea.
