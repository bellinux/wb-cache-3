5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style.

5|$|Following minor {{events in}} 1917, 1927, 1931, and 1939, {{threatening}} activity resumed {{in the late}} 1950s, when, in 1957, an earthquake near Birmingham extended from northern Alabama to Georgia and Tennessee, cracking and displacing small objects. A 1959 event in Huntsville, although smaller, damaged chimneys, wrecked plaster, and threw <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> shelves and tables. More recently, events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne, registering magnitudes of 4.9 and spawning shaking. The Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, {{at the age}} of 26, Chatwin was {{promoted}} to a director of Sotheby's, a position to which he had aspired. To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board. This disappointment, along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby's, including the sale of <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> the Pitt-Rivers museum collection, led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby's post in June 1966.|$|E

5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E

A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany.

5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign <b>objects</b> <b>from</b> entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
