5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, King {{said that}} Flagg {{had been a}} {{presence}} in his writing {{since the beginning of}} his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, [...] "The Dark Man", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written {{on the back of a}} placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain as somebody who was always <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E

Instead of losing myself in the story, I often felt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>looking</b> <b>in,</b> appreciating the craftsmanship, but one step removed from the agony on display.
