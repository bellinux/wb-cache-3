These simulations were in general support of a larger research program conducted by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game that is evaluating the efficacy of strobe lights to deter fish from entering the regulating outlets and powerhouse turbine intakes. Simulation results indicate that large variations in forebay water velocities occur over the typical range of regulating outlet operations and seasonal water surface fluctuations.

40|$|Canyon Creek Meadows Dam on {{existing}} and future hydrologic {{conditions of the}} Canyon Creek watershed. Three scenarios were assessed; 1) Existing conditions- leaving the <b>outlet</b> <b>gate</b> locked open and not allowing the reservoir to maintain a pool, 2) Dam removed- removal of the dam and storage area in order to pass flows downstream unimpeded, and 3) Dam repaired- repair of the dam such that the reservoir pool is maintained {{in the spring and}} summer recreation period and the <b>outlet</b> <b>gate</b> is set to maintain a minimum flow of approximately three cubic feet per second.

40|$|A {{qualitative}} geomorphic {{assessment was}} conducted to characterize the current conditions along Canyon Creek and the expected morphologic responses associated with both dam removal and dam repair. In addition, the volume of sediment deposited in Canyon Creek Meadows Reservoir was estimated and {{an evaluation of the}} erosion potential of the accumulated sediments was performed. The existing operation of the dam is to maintain the <b>outlet</b> <b>gate</b> in a fully opened position. This has an effect on the sediment transport capacity of the channel in the reach upstream of the reservoir. During high flows that exceed the capacity of the outlet culvert, transport of bed material is significantly reduced and sediment is deposited in the channel and overbank areas that are inundated by the reservoir pool. As the reservoir inflow rate drops below the outflow rate of the culvert, the reservoir pool drops and flow is concentrated into the low flow channel within the reservoir. As a result, sediment transport capacity increases. Where the flow is concentrated in the low flow channel, deposited sediments are remobilized and transported to downstream reaches. In the overbank areas affected by the reservoir pool, sediment deposits are not remobilized unless local storm events cause surface erosion by overland flow. A permanent sediment deposit has accumulated in a topographically wide area located approximately 350 feet upstream of the dam, between the dam and an upstream constriction caused b...|$|E

The analysis was done with the 99 % level of confidence which showed that oscillating broadcaster had higher broadcasting uniformity than centrifugal broadcaster. Also results showed that increasing the average of particles mass would increase the uniformity of broadcasting.

40|$|If air is entrained in {{a bottom}} outlet of a dam in an {{uncontrolled}} way, the resulting air pockets may cause {{problems such as}} blowback, blowout and loss of discharge capacity. In order to provide guidance for bottom outlet design and operation, this study examines how governing parameters affect air entrainment, air-pocket transport and de-aeration and the surrounding flow structure in pipe flows. Both experimental and numerical approaches are used. Air can be entrained into the bottom outlet conduit due to vortex formation at the intake if the intake submergence is not sufficient. The influent of the intake entrance profiles and channel width on the critical submergence were studied in the experiment. The experimental study was performed to investigate the incipient motion of air pockets in pipes with rectangular and circular cross sections. The critical velocity is dependent on pipe slope, pipe diameter, pipe roughness and air-pocket volume. If the pipe is horizontal, air removal is generally easier in a rectangular pipe than in a circular pipe. However, if the pipe is downward-inclined, air removal is easier in a circular pipe. When a bottom <b>outlet</b> <b>gate</b> opens, air can become entrained into the conduit in the gate shaft downstream of the gate. Using FLUENT software, the transient process of air entrainment into a prototype bottom outlet during gate opening is simulated in three dimensions. The simulations show in the flow-pattern changes in the conduit {{and the amount of}} air entrainment in the gate shaft. The initial conduit water level affects the degree of air entrainment. A de-aeration chamber is effective in reducing water surface fluctuations at blowout. High-speed particle image velocimetry (HSPIV) were applied to investigate the characteristics of the flow field around a stationary air pocket in a fully developed horizontal pipe flow. The air pocket generates a horseshoe vortex upstream and a reverse flow downstream. A shear layer forms from the separation point. Flow reattachment is observed for large air pockets. The air―water interface moves with the adjacent flow. A similarity profile is obtained for the mean streamwise velocity in the shear layer beneath the air pocket. QC 20140211 </p...|$|E

Laboratory experiments were conducted to establish the flow characteristics of these pipes under the low heads and high flow rates typical of furrow irrigation of cotton in Australia. Two different diameters of layflat {{were used in the}} study, 222. 8 and 425 mm. Proprietary 50 mm diameter <b>outlets</b> (<b>gates)</b> were installed in the layflat at 1 m spacings. Tests were conducted at various pressures and flow rates to determine; the geometric characteristics of the fluming and their relationship to pressure, the friction loss coefficient for the fluming with and without the outlets installed, and the head-discharge characteristic for the outlets. It was shown that the fluming is capable of supplying the desired flow rates (about 6 l s- 1 per furrow) at pressure heads < 1 m. The head-discharge characteristic for the proprietary outlets followed a similar form to the standard orifice equation. No evidence was found to suggest that the velocity head played any significant role in determining the outlet discharge. The Hazen-Williams coefficient (CHW) of the fluming with the outlets installed was a low 80 compared to a value of about 140 for the fluming without gates. This clearly illustrates the increase in energy losses caused by the protrusion of the gates into the flow and that these losses far exceed the losses due simply to pipe friction. These experimentally derived coefficients and characteristic equations were used to validate the simulation program GPIPE. ...|$|R

The traditional gated pipes are known to exhibit a range of pressure head variations along the pipeline causing a non-uniform discharge from orifices while the modified gate pipe system, known as compensating gated pipes (SCGO) stabilizes the pressure heads and produce more uniform water discharge along the pipe line. The effect of three gate spacings (0. 7, 1. 0 and 1. 5 m) was studied in a field experiment that has been conducted for two successive seasons, 2011 – 2012 and 2012 – 2013. The SALTMED model has been applied and showed excellent agreement between the simulated and observed soil moisture, dry matter, yield and water productivity. Similar to the field results, the simulated values indicated that the modified (SCGO), with the 1. 5 m gate spacing, gave the highest yield and water productivity. The modified gated pipe received less water than the traditional gated pipe, due to its high application efficiency. In addition to water saving, there is an economic benefit for using 1. 5 m gate spacings as its cost is low (14 gates per 21 m pipe length) in comparison with 1. 0 m and 0. 7 m spacings. The results confirmed SALTMED ability to simulate with high precision, soil moisture, dry matter, water productivity and yield for potato under gated pipe irrigation.
