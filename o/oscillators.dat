5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric <b>oscillators.</b> However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear <b>oscillators.</b> The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
50|$|An <b>oscillator</b> {{start-up}} timer (OST) is {{a module}} {{used by some}} microcontrollers to keep the device reset until the crystal <b>oscillator</b> is stable. When a crystal <b>oscillator</b> starts up, its frequency is not constant, which causes the clock frequency to be non-constant. This would cause timing errors, leading to many problems. An <b>oscillator</b> start-up timer ensures that the device only operates when the <b>oscillator</b> generates a stable clock frequency.The PIC microcontroller's <b>oscillator</b> start-up timer holds the device's reset for a 1024-oscillator-cycle delay to allow the <b>oscillator</b> to stabilize.|$|R

5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic <b>oscillators</b> and synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, {{impressed}} {{with what he}} saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions {{as well as new}} ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and <b>oscillators</b> patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog <b>oscillators</b> and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E

A number of programs are available to store sounds under three categories – Synth, Pad or Bass.

5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite <b>oscillators</b> due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU.

25|$|In 1900, Max Planck {{hypothesized}} that the frequency of light emitted by the black body depended on {{the frequency of the}} oscillator that emitted it, and the energy of these <b>oscillators</b> increased linearly with frequency (according to his constant h, where E = hν). This was not an unsound proposal considering that macroscopic <b>oscillators</b> operate similarly: when studying five simple harmonic <b>oscillators</b> of equal amplitude but different frequency, the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the highest energy (though this relationship is not linear like Planck's). By demanding that high-frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency, and further requiring that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a lesser frequency, Planck avoided any catastrophe; giving an equal partition to high-frequency <b>oscillators</b> produced successively fewer <b>oscillators</b> and less emitted light. And as in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, the low-frequency, low-energy <b>oscillators</b> were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal jiggling from higher energy <b>oscillators,</b> which necessarily increased their energy and frequency.|$|E
