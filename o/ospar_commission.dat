40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} ship of {{opportunity}} (Ferrybox) concept for both sustained monitoring of UK shelf sea waters and numerical model validation. Release of phosphate from the wreck of a chemical tanker (MV Ece) in the western English Channel (49. 73 °N, 3. 25 °W) in March 2006 is used to demonstrate the importance of sustained observations in decision support systems and policy development. The Ferrybox system continuously collects sea surface (5 m) data from a suite of autonomous electronic sensors installed on a passenger ferry operating year-round between Portsmouth (UK) and Bilbao (Spain). The detection of anomalously high concentrations of phosphate (1. 54 mmol m− 3, four times the usual level) and onset of phytoplankton growth close to the wreck site in March 2006 {{was placed in the}} context of multiple years of measurements (phosphate, nitrate, silicate and chlorophyll) collected from the Ferrybox system (2003 – 2006) and the long-term time series station E 1 (50. 03 °N, 4. 65 °W, 1930 – 1987) in the English Channel. With regard to decision support, release of phosphate from the tanker is unlikely to pose a threat as phytoplankton growth at the end of winter is not unusual in this region and dissolved inorganic nitrogen rather than phosphate (DIN:DIP = 10 – 18) is likely to ultimately limit algal growth in spring 2006. With regard to policy development, the Oslo and Paris (<b>OSPAR)</b> <b>commissions</b> recommendation of sampling every three years in “non-problem areas” is likely to provide statistically inadequate data, given the interannual and decadal variability identified in the Ferrybox and E 1 data: the Ferrybox data show that oceanic winter nutrient concentrations varied by 35 – 50 % between 2003 / 2004 and 2005 / 2006 due to deeper mixing of water off-shelf in early 2005 / 2006 and comparisons between the Ferrybox and E 1 years show that the western English Channel is currently experiencing a low in phosphate concentrations similar to those in the 1960 s. The importance of Ferrybox data in evaluating the reliability of predictive operational models needed in decision support is also demonstrated, by highlighting both strengths and weaknesses in a state-of-the-art ecosystem model designed for UK shelf waters...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{collecting}} beached birds along the Flemish coast {{goes back to}} 1962. The study aims to determine the oil-rate (the proportion of oiled birds) of the beach washed birds, {{which is a good}} tool to determine trends in the chronic pollution of our coastal waters with oil. Since 1992, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) is responsible for the Beached Bird Surveys (BBS) and organises systematic counts once a month during October - March. The numbers of beached birds fluctuated a lot over the previous decades, depending on the number of birds wintering along our coast, oil spills and weather conditions. During the winter 2006 / 2007, 447 beached birds were counted along the Flemish coast, being 0. 99 birds km - 1, close to the average number of 1. 06 birds km - 1 since the winter 1991 / 1992 (numbers of beached birds due to the Tricolor oil spill during the winter 2002 / 2003 are ignored in this analysis). The highest densities were encountered during February, a general tendency. Auks and gulls were the most numerous last winter, and that was always the case since the winter 1991 / 1992. A of Uria aalge and Razorbills) last winter will be remembered as the winter with the highest proportion of auks since the winter 1992. Guillemots and Razorbills are especially vulnerable for oil pollution because they spend most of their life swimming at beach were auks. During {{the first half of the}} winter, the oil-rate was relatively low, but the second half was characterised by a relatively high score. Recently, <b>OSPAR</b> (the <b>commission</b> for the Protection of Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) has recognised the oil-rate among Guillemots as EcoQ, an indicator to evaluate trends in chronic oil pollution of the marine environment. The EcoQ-objective is to force back the oil rate of Guillemots to 10 % or less. When examining the changes in the oil-rate of Guillemots that washed ashore our beaches since 1962, three periods are noticeable. Between 1962 and 1990, the oil rate of beached Guillemots was very high (> 95 % of all beached Guillemots were fouled). Since 1990, there was a remarkable decline with an average oil-rate of about 60 %. Since 2004 the decline continued with an all time lowest score of an oil-rate of ‘only’ 17 % last winter. On the other hand, there is no decline in the density of Guillemots found death along the Flemish coast, so possibly a problem in food viability is responsible for the death of many auks since 1990. Diet studies on collected auks will hopefully tell us something why auks wash ashore without any visible reason...|$|R

Fin-fish were also collected from five Irish fishing ports and analysed for total mercury content in compliance with the European Commission's Decision of 19 May 1993 on mercury in fisheries products. Selected samples of fin-fish were also analysed for trace metal and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration. As there are no generally accepted European standards for the concentration of these contaminants in shellfish or fin-fish, the levels were compared with the available standards and guidance values compiled by the Oslo and Paris <b>Commission</b> (<b>OSPAR)</b> countries for human consumption.

The normal operation of the endocrine (hormonal) system can be disrupted {{by a number of}} man-made and naturally-occurring chemicals, thereby affecting those physiological processes that are under hormonal control. Such substances are called endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The endocrine disruption issue has alarmed the environmental authorities since the substances involved can hinder hormonal processes causing far-reaching effects on reproduction and development in current and future human and wildlife generations. Effects on some species of fish triggered worldwide concern and initiated a research scheme which is being undertaken by various organisations e. g. United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), United Kingdom Environment Agency (UKEA), Oslo and Paris <b>Commission</b> (<b>OSPAR),</b> Japan Environment Agency (JEA) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in order to assess the effects (present and potential), point of generation, levels of contamination and exposure limits. The findings showed that most of the oestrogens are produced by humans and animals and get discharged into river streams mainly through sewage effluents. Fish in particular {{have been found to be}} affected the most even when the oestrogenic levels in water are very low. The probability of future European legislation to eliminate hormonally active compounds from wastewaters suggests that new and alternative methods should be developed for their removal. In this work, the adsorption of 17 ß-oestradiol (E 2) and 17 a-ethinyl oestradiol (EE 2) onto several granular activated carbons and Hypersol-Macronet hypercrosslinked polymers was investigated by batch experiments after a low level detection system had been developed using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Equilibrium experiments were carried out for all adsorbents to quantify the sorption capacity for E 2 and EE 2. For better assessment of the sorbents performance, their physical properties such as surface area, average pore diameter and micropore volume and chemical structure were characterised by N 2 adsorption experiments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, sodium capacity determination, pH titration, proton binding curves and zeta potential measurements. Adsorption isotherm data were fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. Activated carbons were found to be preferable to Hypersol-Macronet hypercrosslinked polymers for adsorption purposes. The adsorption of oestrogens appears to be controlled by hydrophobic interactions. Kinetic experiments were performed with different size ranges of adsorbents at different concentrations and the results were analysed by a particle diffusion model. It was found that concentration did not seem to influence the kinetics of the oestrogen sorption whereas the particle size of the adsorbents influenced the adsorption rate of both molecules. The particle diffusion model seemed to fit the data collected for the adsorption rate of 17 B-oestradiool onto the adsorbents but gave a poor fit for most of the data collected for 17 a-ethinyl oestradiol...|$|R
