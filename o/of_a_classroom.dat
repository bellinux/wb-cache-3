5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E

25|$|Great Falls High School {{was founded}} {{in the fall of}} 1890 by the city of Great Falls after four teenage girls (newly arrived in the city) asked to receive a high school public education. The four young women {{constituted}} the first class, which met in a corner <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> in the Whittier Building (which, by that time, featured instruction in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades). By September 1892, Great Falls High School was an independent school within the city public school system. Its 23 students also had a specified course of instruction (rather than general classes).|$|E

She also tried to overcome her shyness by entering a public speaking contest and volunteering to take minutes at student meetings.|$|E

25|$|Association {{with the}} Infantry School increased, but {{inspection}} trips formerly used at Langley first became voluntary {{and then were}} discontinued. Only a handful of graduates {{had gone on to}} attend the Command and General Staff School, and as a result the Tactical School ended its role as a preparatory school. Instead the ACTS became the equivalent for Air Corps officers of C, and increased the emphasis on air subjects to {{more than half of the}} total course hours by 1934–1935, with an accompanying decrease in hours for ground and administrative subjects. Classroom studies were similarly altered. Lectures occupied only half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>classroom</b> hour, with the remainder given over to discussion and debate of concepts presented and of alternative ideas.|$|E

Suddenly, Willow is attacked and has the life sucked out of her by the First Slayer.|$|E
