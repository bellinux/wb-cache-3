5|$|Elagabalus {{was born}} {{around the year}} 203 to Sextus Varius Marcellus and Julia Soaemias Bassiana. His father was {{initially}} {{a member of the}} Equites class, but was later elevated to the rank of senator. His grandmother, Julia Maesa, was the widow of the consul Julius Avitus, the sister <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> Domna, and the sister-in-law of the emperor Septimius Severus. He had at least one sibling: an unnamed elder brother. His mother, Julia Soaemias, was a cousin of the Roman emperor Caracalla. His other relatives included his aunt Julia Avita Mamaea and uncle Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus and among their children, their son Severus Alexander. Elagabalus's family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god Elagabal, of whom Elagabalus was the high priest at Emesa (modern Homs) in Roman Syria.|$|E

5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone. Early on September17, Julia weakened to a tropical depression. Despite {{a slight increase}} in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued to take its toll on the increasingly ill-defined storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12hours. While moving north, the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E
5|$|Miranda's mom {{is invited}} {{to appear on the}} $20,000 Pyramid. In hopes of winning the money and having a better life, Miranda and her mom's boyfriend Richard prep her for the show.

She suddenly realizes that the laughing man is an older incarnation of Marcus, who has come from the future to save Sal's life. He needed to deliver the notes to the young Marcus through Miranda. Later on Miranda goes to the mailbox the laughing man (Marcus) slept under, where she finds a picture of an older version <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> smiling happily. The novel ends as Miranda reflects on the events in an epilogue.|$|E
5|$|Scholar William Luis observes {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} between the structure <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents and Alejo Carpentier's Viaje a la Semilla as both employ the tactic of backwards narration and consequently {{lay claim to}} two beginnings and two endings. Alvarez has also been said to follow the stylistic traditions established by novels such as Pedro Juan Labarthe's The Son of Two Nations: The Private Life of a Columbia Student (1931), Marcio Veloz Maggiolo's El prófugo (1962), Humberto Cintrón's Frankie Cristo (1972), and Richard Ruiz's The Hungry American (1978). Despite the overtly North American stylistic qualities the book appears to boast at first glance, each of the aforementioned authors are of Hispanic descent.|$|E

5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> trace {{back to a}} {{vigorous}} tropical wave, or an equatorward low-pressure area, which emerged into the Atlantic along the western coast of Africa on September11. At the time, the system maintained deep convection and strong easterly winds, prompting the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to commence tracking the system as an area of interest. As the wave moved generally westward at 10 to 15mph (16 to 24km/h), a quick increase in organization {{as well as a}} significant drop in surface pressure became notable. The system continued to organize, and several hours later, the NHC noted only a slight increase would suffice {{for the development of a}} tropical cyclone. By September12, a tropical depression developed, and the NHC initiated advisories at 1500UTC that day. At the time, the cyclone was situated 250mi (400km) southeast of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> and a longing for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.|$|E
5|$|When the entourage reached Rome in {{the autumn}} of 219, Comazon and other allies <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> Maesa and Elagabalus were given {{powerful}} and lucrative positions, to the chagrin of many senators who did not consider them worthy of such privileges. After his tenure as Praetorian prefect, Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as consul twice. Elagabalus soon devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 58% to 46.5%— the actual silver weight dropping from 1.82grams to 1.41grams. He also demonetized the antoninianus during this period in Rome.|$|E

5|$|The Best Man Wins is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> Seaton and propose {{to her on the}} same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time the caliber of both men are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally attests to the character of both men when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The same {{tropical}} {{wave that}} led to the formation <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> moved off the western coast of Africa on September11, leading {{to the development of a}} tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September23 about 565mi (910km) east of Cabo Gracias a Dios. Steered west to west-northwest by a subtropical ridge to its north, the depression steadily organized, intensifying into Tropical Storm Matthew six hours after formation and attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) by 18:00UTC on September23, an intensity it maintained while making just south of Cabo Gracias a Dios an hour later. The system briefly emerged into the Gulf of Honduras on September25 before making a second landfall north-northeast of Monkey River Town, Belize, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) around 15:00UTC. The system weakened quickly once inland, falling to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC and degenerating into a remnant low by 12:00UTC on September26. The remnant low turned southwest and dissipated twelve hours later.|$|E
5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover <b>of</b> <b>Julia</b> Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E
