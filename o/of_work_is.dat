5|$|A {{programme}} <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{scheduled to}} take place in 2018 to replace expansion joints in both towers along with replacing the truss end links. Plans to replace these joints were postponed by the bridge management following the Scottish Government's commitment to the construction of the Queensferry Crossing; the original work proposals would have involved round-the-clock contraflows during the installation of ramps and mini-bridges to carry traffic over the work area, and heavy lorries being diverted.|$|E
5|$|Nolan's {{films are}} rooted in {{epistemological}} and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. His body <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> permeated by materialistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, innovative soundscapes, large-format film photography, and analogous relationships between visual language and narrative elements. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a vocal advocate for film preservation and the continued availability of film stock.|$|E
50|$|Much <b>of</b> {{non-monetary}} <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{categorized as}} either civic work or housework.

5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
25|$|The SI unit <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> the joule (J), {{which is}} defined as the work {{expended}} by a force of one newton through a displacement of one metre.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{tells us}} that the production <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> reduced by the generation of entropy. The term TaSi gives the lost work, or dissipated energy, by the machine.|$|E

25|$|The {{message from}} this entire body <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> that {{the climate system}} is telling a {{consistent}} story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and circulation patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.|$|E
25|$|Ethel Leginska's body <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{relatively}} small, {{consisting of}} piano pieces and songs, excluding her orchestral works and three operas. Among her major compositions are quartets for strings and piano, four Poems and six nursery rhymes. Many of her works are still unpublished.|$|E
25|$|Work {{commenced}} during 2013, with bridge-strengthening works near London Bridge station {{completed in}} June 2013. The first track {{was used for}} services from 27 December 2016, two new lines for SouthEastern traffic will come into service after the August bank holiday and the overall programme <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> {{expected to be completed}} in January 2018.|$|E

40|$|Most of our labour {{policies}} {{were established in}} the early 1900 s when the old world <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> vastly different from today's world <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> These differences <b>are</b> elaborated upon, as are the basic background factors that are shaping labour policy today. Ten key ingredients of labour policy appropriate {{to the new world}} <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>are</b> then outlined and illustrated with specific policy examples. The paper concludes with a checklist of questions to ask with respect to policy initiatives in the new world <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> as well as a list of research needs to guide policy formation in this area. The suggested ingredients of a new labour policy for the new world <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>are</b> substantially different than those that were appropriate for the old world <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|It {{is defined}} as the work needed to {{accelerate}} a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity. Having gained this energy during its acceleration, the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes. The same amount <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> done by the body when decelerating from its current speed to a state of rest.|$|E
25|$|Writing in {{the early}} 20th century, Max Weber {{believed}} that a definitive feature of a developed state {{had come to be}} its bureaucratic support. Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{fuel cells}} operate on {{reformed}} natural gas, hydrogen or methanol. Ethanol {{is an attractive}} alternative due to its wide availability, low cost, high purity and low toxicity. There are {{a wide range of}} fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including direct-ethanol fuel cells, auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems. The majority <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> being conducted at a research level although {{there are a number of}} organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells.|$|E

25|$|During most of {{the colonial}} period, {{ceramics}} in Mexico State were mostly produced for self consumption. Ceramics became a fusion of Spanish and indigenous techniques and designs. It remained so until {{the first half of}} the 20th century, when decorative and even luxurious pieces began to be produced. This type <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> typified by the tree of life, especially those that are not religious in function. These non-religious trees have themes such as death or spring.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Cross began to {{experience}} {{trouble with his}} eyes, which grew more severe in the 1900s. He also increasingly suffered from arthritis. At least {{in part due to}} these health issues that plagued him for years, Cross's body <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> relatively small. However, in his last years he was productive and very creative, and his work was featured in significant solo exhibitions; he received great acclaim from critics and enjoyed commercial success.|$|E
25|$|Ex situ {{strategies}} for conservation of fungi are also currently under way, including ectomycorrhizal fungi, {{but a great}} deal <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> still needed. There are large culture collections maintained throughout the world; however, there are only approximately 11,500 species included. This represents only about 17% of known fungal species, and around 1% of the world’s estimated species of fungi. A great deal of worldwide cooperation is {{needed in order to}} secure the fungal genetic resource for the future.|$|E

25|$|Except the {{difficulty}} of the sentiment analysis itself, applying sentiment analysis on reviews or feedback also face the challenge of spam and biased reviews. One direction <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review. Review or feedback poorly written are hardly helpful for recommender system. Besides, a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product, thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written.|$|E
25|$|Krasner is {{identified}} as an abstract expressionist due to her abstract, gestural, and expressive works. She worked in painting, collage painting, charcoal drawing, and occasionally mosaics. She would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings. She also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature. As a result, her surviving body <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> relatively small. Her catalogue raisonné, published in 1995 by Abrams, lists 599 known pieces.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{community}} or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores {{is related to}} remix culture. She proposes a possible model of scholarly writing that collects and compiles work in illuminating ways. To be viable, this would require institutional acknowledgement that this kind <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> as valuable as the traditional scholarly monograph, and also {{the participation of the}} scholarly community in a gift economy with their work. She suggests that scholars use a Creative Commons license for scholarly work to facilitate the use and reuse of material for the collective benefit of the community.|$|E
