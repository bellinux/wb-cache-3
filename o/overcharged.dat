40|$|Using 406 <b>overcharge</b> estimates, {{the study}} {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} cartel characteristics and the market environment on the magnitude of <b>overcharges</b> attained by cartels in different geographic markets and during six antitrust law regimes starting from the 18 th century. The median <b>overcharge</b> achieved by cartels is 20 percent of selling price. As predicted by cartel theory, market structure is an important determinant of the <b>overcharge</b> level. Markets where cartels have high market shares tend to have higher <b>overcharges.</b> The number of cartel participants and the size inequality among them are inversely related to the <b>overcharge</b> level. International cartels impose higher <b>overcharges</b> than domestic cartels. <b>Overcharges</b> attained in the US and European markets tend to be lower than <b>overcharges</b> achieved in the Asian markets {{and the rest of}} the world. Results on the impact of changes in the antitrust law environment over time on the size of cartel <b>overcharges</b> are mixed.

To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions.

5000|$|<b>Overcharging,</b> in law, {{refers to}} a prosecutorial {{practice}} that involves [...] "tacking on" [...] additional charges that the prosecutor knows he cannot prove. It is used to put the prosecutor in a better plea bargaining position. [...] The term has been defined in different ways. Alschuler writes that [...] "to prosecutors, <b>overcharging</b> is accusing the defendant of a crime {{of which he is}} clearly innocent to induce a plea to the 'proper' crime. Defense counsel identify two types of <b>overcharging.</b> 'Horizontal' <b>overcharging</b> is the unreasonable multiplying of accusations against a single defendant. He may be either charged with a separate offense for every technical criminal transaction in which he participated, or the prosecutor may fragment a single criminal transaction into numerous component offenses. 'Vertical' <b>overcharging</b> is charging a single offense at a higher level than the circumstances of the case seem to warrant." [...] Vertical <b>overcharging</b> is deemed to be the more abusive of the two practices.

The conventional hybrid premium could fall to US$2000 in five years, with US$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries, providing for a three-year payback.

40|$|Mean-field {{theory is}} used to model {{polyelectrolyte}} adsorption {{and the possibility of}} overcompensation of charged surfaces. For charged surfaces that are also chemically attractive, the <b>overcharging</b> is large in high salt conditions, amounting to 20 - 40 % of the bare surface charge. However, full charge inversion is not obtained in thermodynamical equilibrium for physical values of the parameters. The <b>overcharging</b> increases with addition of salt, but does not have a simple scaling form with the bare surface charge. Our results indicate that more evolved explanation is needed in order to understand polyelectrolyte multilayer built-up. For strong polymer-repulsive surfaces, we derive simple scaling laws for the polyelectrolyte adsorption and <b>overcharging.</b> We show that the <b>overcharging</b> scales linearly with the bare surface charge, but its magnitude is very small in comparison to the surface charge. In contrast with the attractive surface, here the <b>overcharging</b> is found to decrease substantially with addition of salt. In the intermediate range of weak repulsive surfaces, the behavior with addition of salt crosses over from increasing <b>overcharging</b> (at low ionic strength) to decreasing one (at high ionic strength). Our results for all types of surfaces are supported by full numerical solutions of the mean-field equations. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, final version. to be published in PR...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of cartel <b>overcharges</b> {{lies at the}} heart of antitrust policy on cartel prosecution as it constitutes a key element in the determination of fines. Connor and Lande (2008) conducted a survey of cartels and found a mean <b>overcharge</b> estimate in the range of 31 % to 49 %. By examining more sources, Connor (2010) finds a mean of 50. 4 % for successful cartels. However, the data used in those studies are estimates obtained from different methodologies, sources and contexts rather than by direct observations. Therefore, these data are subject to model error, estimation error and publication bias. A quick examination of the Connor database reveals that the universe of <b>overcharge</b> estimate is asymmetric, heterogenous and contains a number of influential observations. Beside the fact that <b>overcharge</b> estimate are potentially biased, fitting a linear regression model to the data without providing a carefull treatment of the problems raised above may produce distorted results.

40|$|Based on unique data characterizing private cartel {{behavior}} {{since the}} 1770 s, this dissertation presents an empirical analysis of four measures of success of overt collusive conduct: <b>overcharges,</b> stability, duration, and a multidimensional index of cartel success. Factors hypothesized {{to contribute to}} success include market structure, internal organization, and legal environment. The results of this research make important contributions to cartel studies and the design of antitrust policies. ^ Empirical findings suggest that markets characterized by {{a high degree of}} seller concentration provide a more favorable environment for cartel success than less concentrated markets. <b>Overcharges</b> attained in concentrated markets are higher, and cartels are more stable. The firms 2 ̆ 7 size inequality within the cartel is negatively related to cartel success. ^ There is mixed evidence about the impact of changes in the antirust law environment on cartel success. First, antitrust enforcement appears to be directed at cartels that attain lower <b>overcharges</b> rather than cartels that achieve higher <b>overcharges.</b> Second, stricter antitrust regulations tend to target cartel <b>overcharges</b> to a higher extent than they target cartel duration. Although cartel <b>overcharges</b> tend to decline over time, the duration of cartel agreements tends to increase over time. The multidimensional index of cartel success tends to increase over time, suggesting that cartels have become more successful as antitrust laws become stricter. However, there is also evidence that antitrust enforcement since 1990 has been the most effective. The <b>overcharges</b> are the lowest during this period. ^ This research shows that <b>overcharges</b> tend to be lower in the countries with the most mature antitrust systems. Empirical findings suggest that current antitrust policy presumptions about the average gain from price-fixing are likely to be too low. Therefore, fines calculated based on these presumptions typically result in sub-optimal deterrence. ...|$|R
