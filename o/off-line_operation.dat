The KL-7 produced printed output on narrow paper strips that were then glued to message pads. When encrypting, it automatically inserted a space between five-letter code groups. One of the reasons for the five letter groups was messages might be given to a morse code operator. The number of five letter groups was easily verified when transmitted. There was an adaptor available, the HL-1/X22, that allowed 5-level Baudot punched paper tape from Teletype equipment to be read for decryption. The standard KL-7 had no ability to punch tapes. A variant of the KL-7, the KL-47, could also punch paper tape for direct input to teleprinters.|$|E

Numerous {{aspects of the}} mobility’s effect on middleware have been analysed {{and the amount of}} previous work allowed to identify the most important patterns. Although the notion of “most important middleware ” depends on the application supported by the middleware, there are traits that can be discovered in most of the connected mobile applications.

Very often, the attempted recordings {{turn out to}} have failed for various reasons, or the imagery proves inadequate for successful image interpretation. Performing this assessment afterwards can induce costs, as it could imply the need to repeat the recordings or to continue working with bad data. The presented work aims to move many of the off-line evaluation procedures to the on-line system. Besides some straightforward operations like configuring the cameras, this also includes processing the live video feeds in order to quickly generate image interpretations and preliminary 3 D reconstructions. While these results will surely be of lower fidelity than what off-line processing with unlimited processing power could achieve, they can provide a minimum guaranteed quality for said <b>off-line</b> <b>operations.</b> The main part of this thesis focusses on {{a new version of the}} shape-from-silhouette algorithm with the following objectives in mind: generating a full and closed 3 D model, both efficiently and robustly, in order to produce a concise and re-usable representation.

The first stage of the MINISAT program conclude with the complete development and orbit qualification of the platform MINISAT 0 together with the operational experiences will be achieved to perform the scientific mission 01. This platform is already left commercially available to perform a lot of scientific missions. The second stage of the MINISAT program consist of the modular upgrading of the platform 0 up to reach the maximum performances or platforms MINISAT 1 to do earth observation missions. The first mission with the platform 1 started the phase A of feasibility study in 1995. The third stage of the MINISAT program will consist {{of the development of}} the platform MINISAT 2 that will be an adaptation of the platform MINISAT 1 {{to be able to do}} communication missions even in the geostationary orbit.

40|$|Traditionally ESA {{missions}} {{have been}} operated using packets {{in accordance with}} the ECSS Packet Utilization Standard (ECSS E- 70 - 41). Increasingly however there is a move towards <b>off-line</b> <b>operations</b> concepts as file transfer has become an ever more common function for ESA missions recently launched and in development (Rosetta, Mars Express, Venus Express, BepiColombo, GAIA). Operations at packet-level on the downlink are perfectly adequate for engineering type of data (housekeeping, etc.), which are processed in near real-time on the ground. Science data however are not processed in near real-time and normally not at the control centre. For this type of data, moving to a file based approach, where each file contains a self-consistent set of data, would make more sense and simplify the downlink operation as well as the distribution to the end user. Similar considerations can be made for other on-board generated products used for spacecraft ‘maintenance’ operations. The use of a file-based data delivery is made possible by the availability of standardized file transfer protocols, such as the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). However the availability of a suitable file delivery mechanism is not sufficient to realize the full benefits of file based operations. In addition it is necessary to have a suitable file management system on-board. This is expected to be provided by the CCSDS Spacecraft On board Interface Services (SOIS), which will among others provide file and packet store services. A further prerequisite for file based operations is the availability of on-board services supporting access to files to carry out the required operations. ESA is currently embarking on an activity to identify the required services. This paper identifies the areas in which adoption of file based operations would be beneficial for future ESA missions and discusses some of the scenarios in which these could be deployed. Some of these scenarios have implications on how mission ground segments should be designed and the consequences of these are outlined. I...|$|R

30|$|Another {{replication}} characteristic with a {{great impact}} on data stores throughput is how write operations are propagated among nodes. Synchronization of replicas can be synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous or eager replication, changes are propagated to replicas before the success of the write operation is acknowledged to the client. This means that synchronous replication introduces latencies because the write operation is completed only after change propagation. This approach is rarely used in NoSQL because it can result in large delays in the case of temporary loss or degradation of the connection. In asynchronous or lazy replication, the success of a write operation is acknowledged before the change has been propagated to replica nodes. This enables replication over large distances, but it may result in nodes containing inconsistent copies of data. However, performance can be greatly improved over synchronous replication. As illustrated in Table  2, the majority of the data stores studied use asynchronous replication. Typically, NoSQL solutions use this approach to achieve the desired performance, yet CouchDB uses it to achieve <b>off-line</b> <b>operation.</b> In CouchDB, multiple replicas can have their own copies of the same data, modify them, and then synchronize these changes at a later time.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a new version of Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network named ordered fuzzy artmap for evaluating on-line short term load forecasting. Fuzzy ARTMAP can operate in off-line or on-line modes. In the on-line mode, the network must process the data as it becomes available, without storing or reusing it. In the off-line mode, the data can be stored and repeatedly presented to the network. In this paper, we consider the <b>off-line</b> <b>operation</b> of fuzzy ARTMAP in classification inputs and then used this classified input to forecast daily load of power network. In particular, we consider one of the major limitations of fuzzy ARTMAP, its dependence on tuning parameters. The performance of fuzzy ARTMAP depends on the values of two parameters called the choice and vigilance parameters, and also on the order of pattern presentation for the off-line mode of training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neural network, short term load forecasting is performed on the IRAN power system. Test results indicate that the special neural network is very effective in improving the accuracy of the forecast hourly loads. For on-line training, the Fuzzy ARTMAP network was found to be a better choice than the other neural networks. Also to enhance performance of specified neural network in off-line classification, we develop it to Ordered Fuzzy ARTMAP network, which has a better performance in input classification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{real-time}} VLBI system using Internet protocol (IP) {{technology has}} been developed to reduce network-cost and to expand connection sites of VLBI network. We call this system “IP-VLBI ” or “Internet VLBI”. We are developing the system consisting of a personal computer (PC) -based sampler equipped with a PCI-bus Versatile Scientific Sampling Processor (VSSP) board and FreeBSD (and/or Linux) software to carry out real-time data transmission, reception and correlation. The IP-VLBI system developed at CRL is dedicated to taking over current geodetic VLBI system. A geodetic VLBI system usually receives 14 to 16 frequency channels at S and X bands. A VSSP board on a PC can sample 4 channel data, hence 4 PCs can cover the current geodetic VLBI system. Each PC (4 -channel) data are transmitted to a PC for correlation processing independently through the Internet. Thus by only establishing the system for a PC sampler, we can easily expand it to the multi-PC sampler system, i. e., geodetic VLBI system. In parallel {{with the development of}} the real-time system, we are also developing a quasireal time (QRT) VLBI system. In the QRT system data are stored in a hard disk at first, then transmitted to a correlation site with a possible transmission speed of network.

40|$|Non-linear {{programming}} {{has been}} extensively used in wireless telecommunication systems design. An important criterion in optimization is the minimization of mean square error. This thesis examines two applications: peak to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and wireless airtime traffic estimation. These two applications are both of interests to wireless service providers. PAPR reduction is implemented in the handheld devices and low complexity is a major objective. On the other hand, exact traffic prediction can save a huge cost for wireless service providers by better resource management through <b>off-line</b> <b>operations.</b> High PAPR {{is one of the}} major disadvantages of OFDM system which is resulted from large envelope fluctuation of the signal. Our proposed technique to reduce the PAPR is based on constellation shaping that starts with a larger constellation of points, and then the points with higher energy are removed. The constellation shaping algorithm is combined with peak reduction, with extra flexibilities defined to reduce the signal peak. This method, called MMSE-Threshold, has a significant improvement in PAPR reduction with low computational complexity. The peak reduction formulated into a quadratic minimization problem is subsequently optimized by the semidefinite programming algorithm, and the simulation results show that the PAPR of semidefinite programming algorithm (SDPA) has noticeable improvement over MMSE-Threshold while SDPA has higher complexity. Results are also presented for the PAPR minimization by applying optimization techniques such as hill climbing and simulated annealing. The simulation results indicate that for a small number of sub-carriers, both hill climbing and simulated annealing result in a significant improvement in PAPR reduction, while their degree of complexity can be very large. The second application of non-linear optimization is in airtime data traffic estimation. This is a crucial problem in many organizations and plays a significant role in resource management of the company. Even a small improvement in the data prediction can save a huge cost for the organization. Our proposed method is based on the definition of extra parameters for the basic structural model. In the proposed technique, a novel search method that combines the maximum likelihood estimation with mean absolute percentage error of the estimated data is presented. Simulated results indicate a substantial improvement in the proposed technique over that of the basic structural model and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) package. In addition, this model is capable of updating the parameters when new data become available...|$|R

40|$|Almost every {{distributed}} or networked application has {{to somehow}} cope with securing its communications channels, thus demanding appropriate system support. In {{just the same}} way as security issues have already gained such importance, it is foreseeable that in the near future accounting schemes will attain similar significance. These new aspects, however, become especially critical when using an open communications infrastructure like the Internet. The Internet as an originally non-profit network does neither offer the security, nor the globally available accounting infrastructure by itself. These problems were addressed in the recent past, but often in a seemingly ad-hoc manner. Several different accounting schemes sensible for only certain types of commercial transactions have been developed, which either seem to neglect the problems of scalability, or trade security for efficiency. Finally, some proposals aim at achieving the best security possible, but do this at the expense of efficiency, thus rendering those systems to be of delimited practical use. In contrast, this paper presents a suitably configurable scheme for security and accounting in a general, widely distributed client/server environment. Features such as efficient <b>off-line</b> <b>operation,</b> prepaid single message requests, options for authenticated as well as anonymous transactions and encrypted meassage traffic can freely be combined in order to form a protocol matching the application's needs.

By the latter means, the immobilized enzyme could be easily regenerated, to ensure the well-kept enzymatic activity of IMERs. All the above mentioned IMERs were successfully applied for the digestion of proteins, membrane proteins or glycoproteins, by which the protein digestion time could be obviously shortened from over 10 h to a few minutes or seconds. Furthermore, such IMERs were on-line integrated with protein separation and peptide separation by HPLC, to ensure the high throughput analysis of proteomes...|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{coordinate}} PEV discharging considering PEV stochastic mobility data. The main idea is to use PEV battery capacities depending on the load profile characteristic to ensure an effective peak shaving throughout the peak times. This requires a coordinated V 2 G strategy by considering both the load profile and PEV characteristics connected to the grid. In this study, the optimal V 2 G solution is first found to provide a basis for assessing the performance of the developed algorithm. Then, a two-stage V 2 G control scheme is developed. The first stage includes an <b>off-line</b> <b>operation</b> to determine the desired level for peak shaving and the time period for V 2 G service based on a forecasted load profile. In the second stage, discharging rates for each PEV are simultaneously determined considering both the load profile level and the available capacities of PEVs participating in V 2 G service. From the distribution system operator (DSO) perspective, PEVs track the load profile in the distribution system so that the peak loads are shaved effectively. From a PEV user convenience point of view, a minimum SOC level is maintained for emergency departures at any time. This is also to avoid the deep discharging which causes premature aging of the batteries. To evaluate the impact of the extra charge energy need resulting from the V 2 G contribution, a simple charging scheduling strategy is employed at off-peak hours. The algorithms are tested on real residential distribution transformer loading data for heuristic user case scenarios with different PEV penetration rates and the performance of the algorithm is assessed by two metrics: peak shaving index (PSI) and peak load reduction (PLR) rate.|$|E

Sites were sampled from each facility on three different days (replication) during the same week. Four air samples (1000 L each) were drawn from each sampling site on a given day. Sampling sites, included areas in or near the following on-site locations: hen house (in-line and mixed operations), farm transition room (in-line and mixed operations), egg washers, egg dryer, packer heads, post-processing cooler, nest-run cooler (<b>off-line</b> and mixed <b>operations),</b> loading dock and dry storage. Type of <b>operation</b> (in-line, <b>off-line</b> or mixed), sampling site and the interaction between operation and site had a significant effect on the number of total aerobic bacteria, molds/yeasts, coliforms and pseudomonads recovered (P < 0. 05). Highest counts for total aerobic bacteria (5. 9 log cfu/ml air), molds/yeasts (4. 0 log cfu/ml air) and coliforms 10 10 (2. 5 log cfu/ml air) were found in the hen house.

40|$|The {{fields of}} {{artificial}} reality and conventional telerobotics share many common technological challenges. In this {{paper we discuss}} the concept of applying techniques of virtual environment simulation {{to address some of}} the challenges of remote manipulation of teleoperated systems in unstructured environments, with a focus on remote excavation. We first present a taxonomy of factors for distinguishing between some of the constraints imposed by different remote interaction environments. In contrast to the conventional methods of continuous closed loop manual control of remote systems, we discuss the concept of supervisory control. This leads to the notion of elevating the operator from low level tasks by providing a virtual model of the remote work site, to allow the operator to plan and rehearse remote <b>operations</b> <b>off-line</b> prior to execution. In an attempt to reduce this concept to practice, we review two complementary approaches: Augmented Reality TEleManipulation Interface System (ART [...] ...|$|R
