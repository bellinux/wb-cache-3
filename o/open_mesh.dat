40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{relative}} cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic methods of inguinal hernia repair compared with <b>open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> and <b>open</b> non-mesh repair. Methods: Data {{on the effectiveness}} of these alternatives came from three systematic reviews comparing: (i) laparoscopic methods with <b>open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> or non-mesh methods; (ii) <b>open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> with <b>open</b> non-mesh repair; and (iii) methods that used synthetic mesh to repair the hernia defect with those that did not. Data on costs were obtained from the authors of economic evaluations previously conducted alongside trials included in the reviews. A Markov model was used to model cost-effectiveness for a five-year period after the initial operation. The outcomes of the model were presented using a balance sheet approach and as cost per hernia recurrence avoided and cost per extra day at usual activities. Results: <b>Open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> was the most cost-effective method of preventing recurrences. Laparoscopic repair provided a shorter period of convalescence and less long-term pain compared with <b>open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> but was more costly. The mean incremental cost per additional day back at usual activities compared with <b>open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> was € 38 and € 80 for totally extraperitoneal and transabdominal preperitoneal repair, respectively. Conclusions: Laparoscopic repair is not cost-effective compared with <b>open</b> flat <b>mesh</b> repair in terms of cost per recurrence avoided. Decisions about the use of laparoscopic repair depend on whether the benefits (reduced pain and earlier return to usual activities) outweigh the extra costs and intraoperative risks. On the evidence presented here, these extra costs are unlikely to be offset by the short-term benefits of laparoscopic repair. Luke Vale, Adrian Grant, Kirsty McCormack, Neil W.

In contrast to existing methods which treat meshes as 3 D polyhedra {{and try to}} partition the faces at their exact intersection curves, we treat meshes as adaptive surfaces which can be arbitrarily refined. Rather than depending on computing precise face intersections, our approach refines the input meshes in the intersection regions, then discards intersecting triangles and fills the resulting holes with high-quality triangles. The original intersection curves are approximated to a user-definable precision, and our method can identify and preserve creases and sharp features. Advantages of our approach include the ability to trade speed for accuracy, support for <b>open</b> <b>meshes,</b> {{and the ability to}} incorporate tolerances to handle cases where large numbers of faces are slightly inter-penetrating or near-coincident...|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} of preference tests offers {{a choice between}} two alternatives. This {{can be done by}} putting different goal boxes at the ends of the arms of a 'T' shaped maze, or having a chamber divided in into differing halves. A famous example of this simple method is an investigation of the preferences of chickens for different types of wire floor in battery cages. Two types of metal mesh flooring were being used in the 1950s; one type was a large, <b>open</b> <b>mesh</b> using thick wire, the other was a smaller mesh size but the wire was considerably thinner. A prestigious committee, the Brambell Committee, conducting an investigation into farm animal welfare concluded the thicker mesh should be used as this was likely to be more comfortable for the chickens. However, preference tests showed that chickens preferred the thinner wire. Photographs taken from under the cages showed that the thinner mesh offered more points of contact for the feet than the thick mesh, thereby spreading the load on the hens' feet and presumably feeling more comfortable to the birds.|$|E

50|$|Healthcare cubicle {{curtains}} are factory {{made and}} constructed from different woven fabrics stitched {{together with the}} top portion of <b>open</b> <b>mesh</b> of the curtain {{as required by the}} National Fire Protection Association (NFPA-701 large & small scale). The suggested fire prevention and regulatory codes are followed by local, state and Federal fire marshals with Healthcare patient safety in mind. The suggestion for mesh is seventy-percent (70%) open allowing for ceiling sprinkler head water penetration in event of fire. The vertical length requirement for mesh size is determined by the number of horizontal inches of the curtain ceiling track from the sprinkler head. Example: If ceiling track is six (6") inches from ceiling sprinkler head, the required vertical length of the mesh is approximately six (6") inches. The maximum vertical mesh length required is eighteen inches (18") regardless of additional distance from the ceiling sprinkler head. The code for the vertical mesh requirement is found under National Fire Protection Agency code NFPA-701/large and small scale (NFPA-701). The lower portion of the cubicle curtain is opaque to ensure patient privacy. Cubicle curtain factory made fabric with an antimicrobial finish is not required by code but is becoming more common in medical treatment facilities to reduce the spread of germs within a facility.

Net pen, or cage, {{technology}} started to be used seriously in Canada in the early 1980s in New Brunswick when joint government /private projects introduced cage technology from Norway. Cage culture started seriously in B.C. in the late 1980s. Smaller scale cage culture developed in freshwaters as well, including Georgian Bay, Ontario and Lake Diefenbaker, Sask. and B.C. The oldest operating cage farm in Canada is actually in Georgian Bay.The conventional net-pen is an <b>open</b> <b>mesh</b> net that is suspended within a framework constructed of steel, wood or plastic, that floats at the surface and {{held in place by}} down-haul weights. The arrangement of the cages (net pens) varies considerably. On Canada's east coast typical cages are circular and constructed of high density poly pipe (HDPE). The cages are 60m to 150m in circumference and moored individually within a grid system. On the west coast the cages are often steel with 8 to 24 cages in a group, half on each side of a main walkway. The cages are typically 15m to 30m across and 15m to 30m deep. Natural currents bring fresh, oxygenated water to the net pens and carry away soluble waste. The solid waste fecal material and uneaten feed settle to the ocean bottom near the cage site. Note that the amount of uneaten feed is negligible because the farmers cannot afford to waste feed, which is typically about 60% of their production cost.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of using <b>open</b> tension-free <b>mesh</b> repair for adult inguinal hernias performed by resident surgeons under the supervision of a chief surgeon in a community hospital. MethodsFrom May, 1992 through April, 2000, we performed 314 <b>open</b> tension-free <b>mesh</b> repairs on 289 patients (234 men, 55 women) with a mean age of 65. 7 years. There were 173 right and 141 left hernias, and 25 were bilateral; while 220 were indirect, 77 were direct and 17 were of the femoral type. There were 281 primary and 33 recurrent lesions. Resident surgeons under the supervision of the first author (SY) performed all hernioplasties. Three types of <b>open</b> tension-free <b>mesh</b> repairs were performed; the Lichtenstein repair (n = 72), the mesh-plug repair (n = 134), and the Hernia System repair (n = 108). ResultsThe duration of surgery averaged 73. 0 minutes. There was no perioperative mortality. Five patients developed subcutaneous wound infections; no case required mesh removal. Hematoma occurred in eight patients, and seroma developed in 25. All haematomas and seromas subsided with repeated aspiration. The average duration of hospitalization was 6. 5 days. The length of follow-up rose from 1 to 8 years, with a mean of 3. 7 years. No patients in any group had a recurrence during the follow-up period. ConclusionsUnder the close supervision of the staff surgeon, tension-free hernioplasties can be performed on adult inguinal hernias by surgeons-in-training in non-specialist centres with excellent outcomes, low postoperative complications and no recurrence.
