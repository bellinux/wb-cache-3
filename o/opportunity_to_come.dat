5|$|English forces laid siege to Loch Leven in 1301, but the {{garrison}} was relieved {{in the same}} year when the siege was broken by Sir John Comyn. King Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) is known to have visited the castle in 1313 and again in 1323. Following Bruce's death, the English invaded again, and laid siege to Loch Leven Castle in 1335 in support of the pretender Edward Balliol (d. 1364). According to the 14th-century chronicle of John of Fordun, the English attempted to flood the castle by building a dam across the outflow of the loch. The water level rose for a month, until the captain of the English force, Sir John de Stirling, left to attend the festival of Saint Margaret of Scotland. The defenders, under Alan de Vipont, took the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of the castle at night, and damaged the dam, causing it to collapse and flood the English camp. The story has, however, been doubted by later historians.|$|E

25|$|Tennessee's {{inability}} {{to get into the}} end zone came to an end on just the third play of the third quarter, when George took a handoff from McNair and stormed through {{the middle of the field}} for a 68-yard touchdown run. Then after several punts, the Titans put together a 13-play, 73-yard drive, featuring a 26-yard completion from McNair to receiver Chris Sanders. With 12:57 left in the fourth quarter, Del Greco finished the drive with his third field goal, increasing the Tennessee lead to 16–9. Later in the quarter, the Colts had a great <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back when wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 87 yards to the Titans 3-yard line, but it was overruled by a replay challenge from coach Jeff Fisher. Fisher had to burn a timeout to get his challenge heard over the roaring crowd in the RCA Dome, but it paid off, as the replay showed Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at his own 33-yard line during the return.|$|E

In a highly heterogeneous community, we {{are more likely to}} make friends with those from different groups, such as people of different ethnicities or occupations.

500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable because the Rangers felt Moreland {{was a better}} option at first base; Rangers' general manager Jon Daniels said {{the day of the}} trade that he knew there was a possibility Davis could turn into a high-impact offensive player and [...] "If he does, we'll live with it." [...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to get the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E
500|$|One of Chloe's key {{relationships}} {{is with the}} series protagonist, Clark Kent. Although believers in the [...] "Chlois" [...] theory initially suspected that Chloe would eventually become Lois Lane, Clark's future wife in the comics, Mack contends that Clark does not love Chloe {{in the way that}} she loves him. The actress does not believe that Clark's feelings will ever change. Regardless of Clark's feelings, Mack recognizes that Chloe is blinded by her love for Clark, which ultimately affects her judgment in not only seeing Clark's faults, but making choices that place her character in danger. In season five, Clark finally discovers that Chloe knows his secret, and this revelation allows Chloe the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with her feelings for Clark; this also provided a means for the two have a more meaningful friendship, without the concerns of Chloe's unrequited love.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E

French coach Raymond Domenech believed that France [...] "scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that." [...] Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded. French player Thierry Henry claimed the team was [...] "really upset" [...] when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as [...] "if he (the referee) had given us the valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back into the match."

2500|$|Uriel is a {{character}} in The Dresden Files book series by Jim Butcher. In Small Favor, Uriel is a subtle but powerful player in the war with the Black Council and the Fallen/Denarians. Called the [...] "Watchman", he only reveals himself to the book's protagonist, Harry Dresden, as a janitor named [...] "Jake". In the novel, Harry receives the power of soulfire and believes that it came from Uriel. He is {{also referred to as}} Heaven's [...] "spook". [...] Uriel also appears at the end of Jim Butcher's novella The Warrior, which was released {{as a part of the}} anthology, Mean Streets. Uriel appears again in Changes, when Harry Dresden asks him for help, after being paralyzed from the waist down. Uriel tells him that he cannot help him, and that he is limited to what he has already done. He also tells Harry that Maggie is indeed his daughter, something that he hadn't been entirely sure of. In Ghost Story, Uriel uses his influence to offer Harry the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to Earth as a spirit to find out the identity of his killer. [...] This is not revealed until close to the end of the book, when Uriel also shows Harry that his friends and family will be okay in his absence. [...] He also shows how Harry was unduly influenced to take up the mantle of the Winter Knight and redresses this imbalance by telling him that Mab, the Winter Queen cannot change who he is. At another point in the book, Uriel becomes enraged when Harry nicknames him [...] "Uri" [...] (omitting [...] "el" [...] (God) from the phrase making up Uriel's name). Unlike his appearances in Small Favor and The Warrior, Uriel's form in Changes and Ghost Story is that of a young man with blond hair, rather than an old janitor. During his appearance in Skin Game, his form is that of an olive skinned young man with dark hair. He is not bound by linear time, and is responsible for protecting Free Will. [...] The author has described the character as a VP of Creation.|$|E
40|$|In post-conflict societies, {{elections}} play several roles.
