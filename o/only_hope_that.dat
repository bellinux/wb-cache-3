5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

At the time, many new lawyers barely scraped together enough business to earn their livings. Most new lawyers could <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they would win well-known cases to ensure their success. Rutledge, however, emerged almost immediately {{as one of the}} most prominent lawyers in Charleston, and his services were in high demand.|$|E

But it was the <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> Seattle-New York Alki held out for a connection with a transcontinental system. On the other hand, the side benefits of the SLS enabled boosters to hit the jackpot with the Great Northern.|$|E

When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{you will be able}} to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

Barbados went into the match as heavy favourites but fell behind to Pacquette's goal on his international debut, which finished as a 1–1 draw. After making his debut, manager Christopher Ericson said [...] "He is great in front of goal, powerful and full of effort and work. I <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> we can get him some more support up front in the next game – if we do I am sure we can win it". He also played in the 1–0 defeat in the second leg on 26 March.|$|E
500|$|... "Provenance" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode an A– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} powerfully intense episode with plenty of strong characterization and ties to former continuity. In short, this episode had something for everyone. I <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the next episode manages {{to live up to}} this beginning." [...] Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Provenance", along with its follow-up [...] "Providence", [...] "does a fairly good job without including Duchovny" [...] due to its adherence to [...] "the series' main storyline [...] the government conspiracies." ...|$|E

When Miles nearly crashed his car, she asked if anyone in Summer Bay is capable of [...] "sitting atop four wheels" [...] without nearly getting killed. Stephen was not a fan of Miles' long hair. When he returned in 2011, she said [...] "we can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> he’s seen a hairdresser since his departure." [...] When he left the series, Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Home and Away [...] "won't be the same without Miles' shaggy barnet".

Of Kennan, historian Wilson D. Miscamble remarked that [...] "ne can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> present and future makers of foreign policy might share something of his integrity and intelligence". Foreign Policy described Kennan as [...] "the most influential diplomat of the 20th century". Henry Kissinger said that Kennan [...] "came as close to authoring the diplomatic doctrine of his era as any diplomat in our history", while Colin Powell called Kennan [...] "our best tutor" [...] in dealing with the foreign policy issues of the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|For {{his third}} opera, Bush chose a {{contemporary}} theme – {{the struggle against}} colonial rule. He intended to collect appropriate musical material from [...] British Guiana, but an attempt to visit the colony in 1957 was thwarted when its government refused him entry. The ban was rescinded the following year, and in 1959 Bush was able to gather and record {{a great deal of}} authentic [...] music from the local African and Indian populations. The eventual result was The Sugar Reapers, [...] premiered at Leipzig on 11 December 1966. The Times correspondent, praising the performance, wrote: [...] "One can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> London will soon see a production of its own". [...] With Nancy, Bush wrote two more operettas for children: The Spell Unbound (1953) and The Ferryman's [...] Daughter (1961). His final opera, written in 1965–67, was Joe Hill, based on the [...] life story of Joe Hill, [...] an American union activist and songwriter who was [...] controversially convicted of murder and executed in 1915. The opera, to a libretto by Barrie Stavis, was premiered [...] at the German State Opera, Berlin, on 29 September 1970, and in 1979 was broadcast by the BBC.|$|E

500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and I <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a B– rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray that he can do a much better job when he writes for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E

500|$|The Queen {{reportedly}} felt a [...] "profound {{sense of}} disappointment" [...] in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing {{in his memoirs}} sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace told a newspaper, [...] "No prime minister before has ever done this and we can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{it will never happen}} again." [...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E
