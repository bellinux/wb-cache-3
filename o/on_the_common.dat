5|$|The system {{operates}} continually (24/7) with a varying headway {{throughout the}} day. During rush hour (07:00–10:00 and 15:00–18:00), {{there is a}} two-minute headway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> section and a four-minute headway on the single-service sections. During Thursday through Saturday night (0:00–05:00), there is a seven/eight-minute headway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> section and a fifteen-minute headway on the single-service sections, and other nights it is twenty minutes on all sections of the metro. At all other times, there is a three-minute headway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> section and a six-minute on the split sections. Travel time from Nørreport to Vestamager on M1 is 14 minutes, to the airport on M2 is 15 minutes, and to Vanløse on M1 and M2 is 9 minutes. In 2009, the metro transported 50million passengers, or 137,000 per day; by 2013, the metro's ridership increased to 55million.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with the}} rest of Upstate New York, <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> {{suffered}} through <b>the</b> 1990s with many empty storefronts. Rothschilds, a local department store, closed in the early 1980s, and its successors, Iszards (the only store outhside of the Elmira area) and a McCurdy's store, closed in the mid-1990s. A McDonald's and a CVS also closed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> in <b>the</b> mid-90s, and a block away, a Woolworths store closed in 1998.

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E

The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily.

5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a logarithmic scale. For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance {{of light in the}} fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
5|$|The four {{lanes of}} I-35E pass through {{downtown}} Saint Paul {{in the center}} of the six lanes of I-94, with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E—exit107A from I-35E north to I-94 east, and exit107B from I-35E south to I-94 west—takes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap instead to the right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> segment, and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 west or I-94 eastbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east and I-94 westbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway10 (US10), which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, and truck traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood.|$|E
40|$|This {{editorial}} {{sets the}} scene for the special feature by explaining the importance of geography to <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> and its governance, critically appraising <b>the</b> existing literature <b>on</b> this theme, highlighting important contributions from recent research and mapping out a future research agenda. It begins by reflecting on how little explicit {{attention has been paid}} to date to the spatial dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> <b>The</b> author critiques <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand <b>the</b> literature <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> for conceiving of spatiality primarily as the local, physical context of commons use and regulation but also, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the spatial science literature for generally neglecting <b>the</b> <b>commons,</b> both conceptually and empirically. The paper then pinpoints important exceptions in the fields of human geography and planning studies, assessing how these works contribute to a more thorough and robust understanding of the relationship between spatiality, <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> and their governance. The analysis of these select works making explicit reference to <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> is complemented with a reflection on how broader debates in the spatial sciences can enrich spatial research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>commons.</b> <b>The</b> final section turns to the papers of the special feature, summarizing each of the papers in order and indicating how they each contribute to the themes developed in the editorial...|$|R

5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other Essays in 1940 and Critical Essays in 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1950, England Your England and Other Essays in 1953—which was revised as Such, Such Were the Joys—and Collected Essays in 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George Orwell from 1954, 1956's The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected Essays in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other Essays and in abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the Great Ideas series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), Some Thoughts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by Penguin in association with Secker & Warburg in 1965. The complete texts Orwell wrote for the Observer are collected in Orwell: The Observer Years published by Atlantic Books in 2003.|$|E
