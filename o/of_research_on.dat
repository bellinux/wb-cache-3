5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically we expect this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E
5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.|$|E

Improving {{reliability}} of the machining center (MC) has great significance for raising the manufacturing level of machine building industry and enhancing the international competitiveness of products. Based on the current situation <b>of</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> the reliability <b>of</b> machining center, this paper presents a systematic discussion of MC {{from the perspectives of}} the reliability design, the test and assessment and reliability management respectively, aiming to improving {{reliability of}} the MC. Relevant methods and approaches, which form a theoretical system <b>of</b> reliability <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> the MC and serve as a scientific and systematic reference basis for them, are proposed. The study of it has an active meaning to raising the level <b>of</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> the reliability <b>of</b> MC...|$|R

5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> <b>on</b> Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E
