40|$|For {{a decade}} and a half Global Positioning System (GPS) common-view time {{transfer}} has greatly served the needs of primary timing laboratories for regular intercomparisons of remote atomic clocks. However, GPS as a <b>one-way</b> <b>technique</b> has natural limits and may not meet all challenges of the comparison of the coming new generation of atomic clocks. Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) is a promising technique which may successfully complement GPS. For two years, regular TWSTFT's have been performed between eight laboratories situated in both Europe and North America, using INTELSAT satellites. This has enabled an extensive direct comparison to be made between these two high performance time transfer methods. The performance of the TWSTFT and GPS common view methods are compared over a number of time-transfer links. These links use a variety of time-transfer hardware and atomic clocks and have baselines of substantially different lengths. The relative merits of the two time-transfer systems are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} single and multi-hop {{performance}} of time synchronization mechanisms for challenging environments characterized by high propagation delays, low duty-cycle operation, and imprecise clocks, such as underwater acoustic sensor networks. We find that receiver-receiver based schemes are unsuitable for such environments, and therefore {{focus primarily on}} sender-receiver schemes. According to our analysis, a one-way dissemination approach provides good clock skew estimation but poor offset estimation while a two-way exchange approach provides accurate offset estimation but imprecise clock skew estimation. In average, using one-way scheme can result in significant cumulative propagation error over multiple hops, and using two-way can lead to high variance of propagation error. We develop and analyze a hybrid <b>one-way</b> dissemination/two-way exchange <b>technique,</b> and verify the performance of our hybrid scheme through trace-based experiments. The results suggest that this hybrid approach can provide bounded average error propagation in multi-hop settings and significantly lower variance of propagation error...|$|R
