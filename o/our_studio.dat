5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from <b>our</b> <b>studio,</b> and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
25|$|The way <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> {{operated}} {{was that}} anything that comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but the duo removed them just before the outfits were publicly unveiled in 2001.

Campbell also criticized the film, describing it as a [...] "lesson about abject failure", writing [...] "no matter how you slice it, the film was a dog, and everyone involved can pretty much line up and take forty whacks. As filmmakers, we failed to execute a misguided concept and <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> refused us the benefit of any doubt." [...] The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film. In one of the few positive notices, MTV writer Adam Rosenberg described the film as [...] "criminally underrated". Rosenberg disagreed with the consensus about the film, labeling it as a [...] "hard-to-find classic". Kim Newman also called the film underrated, writing that the film [...] "revels" [...] in its slapstick nature, taking influence from everything from horror comics to The Three Stooges.|$|E

Hoppus and Barker spent {{the remainder of the}} year in discussions with record companies before announcing that the planned next +44 album would see release via Interscope Records. According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album: [...] "As for +44, there had been months slipping by with no real work on that one aside from writing snippets here and there, although there were also reports flying about that the next tour would take in a lot more of the world including South America." [...] Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo studio album. [...] "I see him in <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> every week, and we'll be in the room of the studio he's working in, listening to stuff he's recorded, or he'll come into the room where I'm working and check out my songs," [...] said Hoppus.
