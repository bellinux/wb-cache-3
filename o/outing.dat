40|$|Background Australian {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} outdoor mobility {{be addressed to}} increase participation after stroke. Aim To investigate {{the efficacy of the}} Out-and-About program at increasing <b>outings</b> delivered during therapy by community teams, and <b>outings</b> taken by stroke survivors in real life. Method Cluster-randomized trial involving 22 community teams providing stroke rehabilitation. Experimental teams received the Out-and-About program (a behavior change program comprising a training workshop with barrier identification and booster session, printed educational materials, audit, and feedback). Control teams received printed clinical guidelines only. The primary outcome was the percentage of stroke survivors receiving four or more <b>outings</b> during therapy. Secondary outcomes included the number of <b>outings</b> received by stroke survivors during therapy and undertaken in real life. Results At 12 months after implementation of the behavior change program, 9 % of audited experimental group stroke survivors received four or more <b>outings</b> during therapy compared with 5 % in the control group (adjusted risk difference 4 %, 95 % CI[*]−[*] 9 to 17, p[*]=[*] 0. 54). They received 1. 1 (SD 0. 9) <b>outings</b> during therapy compared with 0. 6 (SD 1. 0) in the control group (adjusted mean difference 0. 5, 95 % CI[*]−[*] 0. 4 to 1. 4; p[*]=[*] 0. 26). After six months of rehabilitation, observed experimental group stroke survivors took 9. 0 (SD 3. 0) <b>outings</b> per week in real life compared with 7. 4 (SD 4. 0) in the control group (adjusted mean difference 0. 5, 95 % CI[*]−[*] 1. 8 to 2. 8; p[*]=[*] 0. 63). Conclusion The Out-and-About program did not change team or stroke survivor behavior...|$|R
