5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> is now practiced in most countries.|$|E

50|$|Two {{comparative}} {{studies have been}} conducted involving mammal populations and diversity among farm practices. A study done by Brown (1999) found that small mammal population density and diversity did not depend on farming practices, however overall activity was higher on <b>organic</b> <b>farms.</b> It was concluded that more food resources were available to small mammals on <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> because of the reduction or lack of herbicides and pesticides. Another study conducted by Wickramasinghe et al. (2003) compared bat species and activity. Species activity and foraging were both more than double on <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> compared to conventional farms. Species richness was also higher on <b>organic</b> <b>farms,</b> and 2 of the sixteen species sighted were found only on <b>organic</b> <b>farms.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E

5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> and more sustainable business practices.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles.

Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in <b>organic</b> <b>farming</b> also.|$|E
40|$|In thesis are {{comparing}} two cattle {{farms in}} area around Svratka, focussed on dairy cows of Czech Fleckvieh cattle. One is conventional farm and other is <b>organic</b> <b>farm.</b> Thesis is focused mainly on analysis {{of differences in}} volume of milk and its composition. Quantity of milk was monitored in monthly intervals for period of one year. Apart from milk quantity we observed contents of fat, protein and lactose. Number and day of lactation was also taken into account. Attention was given to composition of daily ration for dairy cows on <b>organic</b> <b>farm,</b> and we also monitored number of somatic cells and solids-non-fat in milk. It was found that dairy cows in <b>organic</b> <b>farm</b> breeding showed permanently lower performance of the animals, which was often statistically provable.

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> support greater levels of biodiversity, it is not known whether this translates into better provision of ecosystem services. Here we use a food-web approach to analyse the community structure and function at the whole-farm scale. Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of <b>organic</b> and conventional <b>farms</b> showed that <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> have significantly more species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and significantly different network structure. Herbivores on <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> were attacked by more parasitoid species on <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service. The explanation for these differences is likely to include inherent differences in management strategies and landscape structure between the two farming systems. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS...|$|R
5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in <b>organic</b> <b>farming,</b> which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E

Results show that milk from Slovene <b>organic</b> <b>farms</b> contain the highest proportion of saturated FA (SFA; 70. 32 %) and the lowest proportion of monounsaturated FA (MUFA; 25. 49 %). Milk from both production systems in Slovenia contained greater proportions of n- 3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; 0. 99 and 1. 20 % in conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>farms,</b> respectively) and lower proportions of n- 6 PUFA (2. 60 and 2. 33 % in conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>farms,</b> respectively) than Italian milk samples (0. 54 and 0. 68 % n- 3 PUFA and 3. 03 and 3. 39 % n- 6 PUFA in conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>farms,</b> respectively). The ratio between n- 6 and n- 3 PUFA was thus lower in Slovene than in Italian milk samples, yet they did not differ statistically between production systems within the States.
