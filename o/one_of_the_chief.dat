5|$|His Remarks {{upon the}} Life of Jan Zamoyski (Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1787), {{published}} anonymously {{on the eve}} of the Great Sejm, transformed the little-known tutor into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth. It became a model for other similar works and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.|$|E

The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} fascinating and exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> draws of tourism to the township.|$|E
5|$|Leo Phokas {{released}} the Byzantine prisoners after {{providing them with}} provisions, and took the booty and Arab prisoners back to Constantinople, where he celebrated a triumph at the Hippodrome. Indeed, the battle of Andrassos made a deep impression among contemporaries, provoking outbursts of celebration in the Empire, and grief and lamentation in the Syrian cities; it is mentioned by all historical sources of the time, and upheld in the contemporary Byzantine treatise De velitatione bellica as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> examples of a successful ambush.|$|E

5|$|Popery is {{favourable}} to ceremony; {{and among}} the ignorant nations ceremony is the only preservative of tradition. Since Protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland, it has perhaps been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> labours of the Ministers to abolish stated observances, because they continued the remembrance of the former religion.|$|E

She also employed several priests who acted as her confessors, chaplains, and religious advisers.

5|$|Bloet was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> {{administrative}} {{officers of}} the kingdom under William II, often associated with Ranulf Flambard, Urse d'Abetot, and Haimo the dapifer. As a bishop, he moved the newly founded monastery of Stow to Eynsham instead. This church was considered a proprietary church and the bishops of Lincoln retained the right to appoint the abbot and installing the abbot in office. The monks of Stow had been established by his predecessor. Bloet also gave the manor of Charleton to the priory of Bermondsey, which became a Cluniac priory during Rufus' reign.|$|E
5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> agricultural activities of the district {{and the opening of}} the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E
5|$|Nasib al-Bakri (1888–1966) was a Syrian {{politician}} and nationalist {{leader in the}} first half of the 20th century. He played a major role in establishing al-Fatat, an underground organization which sought the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories. As the chief envoy between al-Fatat and the Hejaz-based Hashemites, al-Bakri became a close aide to Emir Faisal when the latter became King of Syria following the success of the 1916 Arab Revolt. Al-Bakri opposed the establishment of the French Mandate of Syria and became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt, leading the rebels' brief capture of Damascus. He escaped a death warrant in Syria in 1927, but returned the following year after being amnestied.|$|E

5000|$|Angus Dow Mackay, <b>the</b> {{ancestor}} <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> Mackay <b>chiefs,</b> attained {{power in}} around 1408. By 1427 he was {{important enough to}} be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiefs</b> summoned to a parliament in Inverness, where they were arrested by James I.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax on trees such as palmyrah, margosa and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each. Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty on clothes (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp), Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna {{to be sold to}} foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} Wiśniowiecki also {{engaged in a}} {{political}} conflict over nobility titles, in particular, the title of prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); the gist of the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chief</b> {{measures}} {{by which}} Ranavalona maintained order within her realm {{was through the}} traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E
