5|$|Early work <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> {{category}} of nova was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory. They identified SAndromedae, {{what they considered}} a typical supernova, as an explosive event that released radiation approximately equal to the Sun's total energy output for 107 years. They decided to call this new class of cataclysmic variables super-novae, and postulated that the energy was generated by the gravitational collapse of ordinary stars into neutron stars. The name super-novae was first used in a 1931 lecture at Caltech by Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 {{at a meeting of}} the American Physical Society. By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the vins de pays, a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC, opened up the Languedoc wine industry to the labeling of varietal wines and the blending of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Chardonnay. Examples include Vin de pays d'Oc, Vin de pays d'Aude, Vin de pays de l'Hérault, and Vin de Pays du Gard. Winemakers such as Guy Anderson, Thierry Boudinaud and E. & J. Gallo Winery capitalized <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> horizon, producing wines like FAT bastard and Red Bicyclette.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin. When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team {{felt that it was}} not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them. Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately. Eventually Meredith Vieira, who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.|$|E

5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|During the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES) eras, Nintendo and Capcom {{enjoyed a}} close relationship, with Mega Man {{as one of}} the NES' most {{prominent}} franchises. This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's monopoly of the video game console market, which allowed the company to compel third-party developers to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule. Sega's rival Genesis system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with third-party developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided to retain a proprietary cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, in the face of Sony's disc-based PlayStation. Due to increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge memory capacity, many third parties—Capcom included—moved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as Resident Evil. <b>On</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering the manufacture of expensive proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or over-stocking inventory which might eat into revenue. This third-party abandonment allowed the PlayStation to outsell the Nintendo 64 during that console generation.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E

25|$|Tyler {{is one of}} two pilots {{that started}} service with the Pacific Air Transport in 1926 flying along the west coast between Canada and Mexico. He is {{credited}} with flying the last leg, from Portland to Seattle, Washington, of a historic five-leg trip between Los Angeles, California, and Seattle, establishing the flight of the Pacific Coast Airways. Landing his biplane at Gorst Field, he handed over the first sack of mail <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> commercial route to Postmaster C. M. Perkins on 15 September 1926. To prepare the route for night flying Tyler and fellow pilot Arthur Starbuck, the other original pilot staff of PAT, drove an old Ford up and down the San Joaquin Valley setting up airway beacon lights with a pick and shovel. By 1928 the PAT had become a unit of Boeing Systems and Tyler continued flying the mail as well as passengers <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> route he had helped to establish.|$|E

25|$|During a {{description}} of the vertebrae of Europasaurus by Carbadillo & Sander (2013), another phylogenetic analysis was conducted (right column above). The cladistic matrix was expanded to include more sauropod taxa, such as Bellusaurus, Cedarosaurus and Tapuiasaurus. The taxon Brachiosaurus was also separated into true Brachiosaurus (B. altithorax) and Giraffatitan (B. brancai), based on Taylor (2009). Based <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>newer</b> and more expansive analysis, Europasaurus was found to be in a similar placement, as a basal camarasauromorph closer to titanosaurs than Camarasaurus. However, Euhelopus, Tehuelchesaurus, Tastavinsaurus and Galvesaurus were placed between Europasaurus and Brachiosauridae.|$|R
25|$|Trying {{it out for}} {{the first}} time on 21 February 1940, it {{immediately}} began producing 400W of 10cm (3GHz) microwaves. Within days they noticed that it was causing fluorescent tubes to light up across the room. Quick calculations showed this meant the tube was creating about 500W, already beating the klystrons. They pushed this over 1,000W within weeks. The main Birmingham team gave up on the klystron and began work <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> cavity magnetron, and by the summer had examples producing 15kW.

25|$|In {{the year}} 1973 {{the state of}} California {{recognized}} Hickman's potentilla as an endangered species.

In preparing an Environmental Impact Report, information on occurrences of Hickman's potentilla was published. Subsequently, in 1995 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) acted <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>new</b> information regarding a species that some thought extinct, and promulgated a notice of intent to classify the species as endangered.|$|E

Although a small amount of coal was being cut from the new colliery, brought to the surface at Birley West, it was not until 1890 when a new winding engine was installed that it fully came on stream. Later expansion came with mining rights being obtained from the Duke of Norfolk to mine below Handsworth Common.|$|E
