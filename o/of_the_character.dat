5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made him seem more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards women in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> in his original story.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Edgar Allan Poe's {{masterpiece}} short stories, "The Fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum. " In this study, I pay attention to how <b>the</b> psychological condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> and <b>the</b> settings in "The Fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Usher" and "The Pit and the Pendulum" influence each other as <b>the</b> major problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis. In this thesis, I want to reveal that <b>the</b> psychological condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> and <b>the</b> settings really influence each other. I use <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> characterization and setting to analyze <b>the</b> psychological condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> and <b>the</b> setting. In the analyzing I know that mental condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> {{is influenced by the}} fearful circumstances and this makes their mental disorder worse; besides, the mental disorder can make the fearful circumstances more fearful. I can conclude that <b>the</b> psychological problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> and <b>the</b> fearful setting really influence each other...|$|R
