40|$|A small animal PET insert for use {{inside of}} a small MR bore is {{currently}} in the design phase. The small diameter of the tomograph results in an increased need to collect Depth of Interaction (DOI) information to mitigate the parallax error. The tomograph will use a Dual Layer <b>Offset</b> <b>block</b> design to collect DOI information. Of critical importance {{to the design of}} the block is the depth into the block where the front layer is separated from the back layer. With the total thickness of scintillating crystal limited to 10 mm, GATE simulations with a single block were run with the front layer thickness ranging from 1 mm to 10 mm (single layer). These simulations characterized the block's ability to accurately locate the radial coordinate of the first interaction location of a `single'. It was found that a split between front and back that is roughly even minimized the mispositioning of the radial coordinate of first interaction. To estimate the reconstructed resolution and resolution uniformity obtainable with this block design, coincidence data from a full tomograph were simulated. Data were reconstructed using Filtered Back Projection. Data were also reconstructed with the DOI information discarded to estimate the improvement in resolution uniformity obtained with this block design. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{deal with}} {{noncoherent}} detection of a digitally phasor block-modulated signal in the additive white Gaussian noise channel when a direct-current (DC) offset {{is present in the}} receiver baseband processing. By processing the received baseband signal block by block, a generalized linear transform is used to remove the offset prior to data detection, thereby releasing the succeeding detection process from the threat of DC offset. Operating on transform output blocks, a generalized maximum-likelihood scheme is developed for noncoherent data detection without a priori knowledge of channel amplitude and phase. When all the signaling blocks are confined within the space expanded by the basis vectors obtained from the offset-removal transform matrix, the proposed detection scheme can exploit the advantage of performing data detection and estimation on channel amplitude and phase jointly in the maximum-likelihood sense. It is analytically shown that the block detection scheme provides the bit error performance asymptotically approaching that of the corresponding ideal coherent phase-shift-keyed (PSK) detection in the absence of DC offset when the block length is increased. An iterative detection scheme is also modified from the block detection scheme to simplify the realization complexity. Both block and iterative detection schemes are shown to outperform the conventional training-sequence-aided PSK detection scheme under the same transmission throughput efficiency.

Both drugs induced a leftward {{shift of the}} steady-state inactivation curve of ICa(L).

In this study, we show that subduction initiation by small-scale convection is, however, favoured by a free surface as compared to a vertically fixed, free-slip surface. A free rock-air interface causes surface down- and uplifts, enables plate bending and increases the horizontal, gravitational sliding of plate portions from high-pressure regions above mantle upwellings to low-pressure regions above mantle downwellings. A freely evolving rock-air interface further allows for more realistic, linear and narrow lithosphere-scale shear zones. These shear zones penetrate through the whole plate by vertically <b>offsetting</b> rigid <b>blocks</b> at the surface and so lead to the characteristic criss-cross pattern.

Methods: The expression of c-erbB 2 mRNA and protein in neonatal ovaries cultured 4 and 8 days with/without {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) were examined by in situ hybridization, RT-PCR and western blot. The function of c-erbB 2 in the primordial folliculogenesis was abolished by small interfering RNA transfection.
