5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> fact that it is grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E
5|$|The best {{documented}} {{account of}} these hauntings occurred between 1968 and 1970. The Evening Herald and Evening Press newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired Garda superintendent, who were converting the house into an arts centre. The redevelopment had been a troubled affair with tradesmen employed on the work leaving complaining of ghosts. One night, {{a friend of the}} O'Brien's, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years after. Although locals were sceptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably of an Indian gentleman and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Mount Pelier Hill. There were also reports of ringing bells and poltergeist activity. In 1970 an RTÉ television crew recorded a documentary at the house. In the documentary a clairvoyant called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through automatic writing. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child <b>or,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>the</b> body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.|$|E

25|$|The lobster-pot traps of Genlisea are {{difficult}} to interpret.

Whatever their origin, the helical shape of the lobster pot is an adaptation that displays as much trapping surface as possible in all directions when buried in moss.|$|E
25|$|A major {{advance in}} {{manufacturing}} began in Europe {{in the late}} 14th century when the safety and thoroughness of incorporation was improved by wet grinding; liquid, such as distilled spirits <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> urine of wine-drinking bishops was added during the grinding-together of the ingredients and the moist paste dried afterwards.

Further, when Hagahot Maimoniyot limits slaves to the seventh portion, the comment closes by citing his teacher, the more famous R. Meir of Rothenburg.|$|E

25|$|The {{right of}} a German court to try an Italian bishop was very {{controversial}} and presaged the Investiture Controversy that characterised the reigns of Henry's son and grandson. Henry continued from there on to Saxony and held imperial courts at Quedlinburg, Merseburg (in June), and Meissen. At the first, he made his daughter Beatrice {{from his first marriage}} abbess, and at the second he ended the strife between the dux Bomeraniorum and Casimir of Poland.

25|$|A {{possible}} non-literary but graphic {{indication that}} people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> world) was a sphere is the use of the orb (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested {{from the time of the}} Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the Reichsapfel was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word 'orbis' means 'circle' and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west till that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire 'world' or cosmos.|$|E

25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not {{delve into the}} mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E
25|$|The Cherokee {{language}} {{is one of}} the few, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> only, Native American language with an increasing population of speakers, and along with Navajo it is the only indigenous language in the United States with more than 50,000 speakers, a figure most likely achieved through the tribe's 10-year long language preservation plan involving growing new speakers through immersion schools for children, developing new words for modern phrases, teaching the language to non-Indians in schools and Universities, fostering the language among young adults so their children can use that language at home, developing iPhone and iPad apps for language education, the development of language radio stations including Cherokee Voices, Cherokee Sounds, and promoting the writing system through public signage, products like Apple Inc., Internet use through Google including Gmail, and others so the language remains relevant in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|From {{the second}} instar on, the spiderlings have a brownish-gray cephaIothorax and limbs, {{and a red}} abdomen with {{markings}} limited to the posterior portion. These consist {{of a pair of}} black stripes, each bearing two conspicuous white dots, separated by a light region. The light region may be gray, white, or even golden; immediately anterior to the black stripes it is enlarged into a conspicuous light dot. While the abdomen of very young spiderlings appears bronze, the red color of the abdomen is striking in later instars. In one of the later instars, the 5th <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> 6th, a red cap appears in the eye region, but this marking disappears in the following molt. The light basal band and side bands of the adult are also present in immature spiders, and, in the two instars proceeding maturity, the chelicerae are also iridescent.|$|E
