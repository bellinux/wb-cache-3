Orahovica d. d.) in North-eastern Croatia {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of chemical weed control through single or multiple applications of post-emergence herbicides, alone or in combinations and their effects on soybean yields. Main weeds were summer annual species of Echinochloa crus-galli (140 - 269 shoots/m 2), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (8 - 56 plants/m 2) and Chenopodium album (3 - 12 plants/m 2). All herbicide treatments showed high efficacy in control of annual grass- and broad-leaved weeds, but were ineffective against perennial weeds. Multiple applications of post-em. herbicide combinations of <b>oxasulfuron</b> + imazamox (92 %), clethodim + fomesafen (93 %) and <b>oxasulfuron</b> + imazamox + thifensulfuron methyl (94 %) at reduced rates, provided better weed control compared to a single application of <b>oxasulfuron</b> (91 %) and imazamox (89 %) at recommended rates. No significant differences were observed in yields between herbicide treatments, ranging from 3395 kg to 3496 kg /ha, on average...|$|E

Here we demonstrate that an optimal separation and analysis of such compounds can be achieved by using a novel analytical method based on “non-aqueous” capillary electrophoresis (CE) system joined to an electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry equipment. Using such a separation method and a particular electrophoretic solution a high reproducibility of migration times and peak areas can be obtained...|$|E

Thus, laboratory experiments were set up to study the feasibility of using tank mixes of B. euphorbiae spores with herbicides or surfactants recommended for soybean. Mycelial growth and conidia germination were evaluated in PDA medium enriched with the herbicides <b>oxasulfuron</b> (80 g/ha), glyphosate (4 L/ha), bentazon (1. 5 L/ha), fomesafen (1 L/ha), chlorimuron-ethyl (80 g/ha), lactofen (1 L/ha) and imazetaphyr (1 L/ha), and the surfactants Energic (2 ml/L), Aterbane (2. 5 ml/L), Silwet L- 77 Ag (1 ml/L), Herbitensil (2 ml/L) and Natur L'óleo (10 ml/L). Dilution of the herbicides at 50 % and 25 % were evaluated based on solution consumption of 300 L/ha. The surfactants were evaluated only in the recommended concentrations. Mycelial growth was not affected by bentazon and fomesafen and slightly by <b>oxasulfuron.</b> However, glyphosate and the surfactants Energic, Herbitensil and Aterbane strongly reduced its growth. The reduction observed on imazetaphyr enriched medium was intermediate and the Natur L'óleo promoted mycelial growth. All of the surfactants allowed B. euphorbiae conidia germination equivalent to that reached in the presence of water. Energic and Herbitensil caused an expressive retardation on spore germination. The germinative process only began after 120 minutes in the presence of Herbitensil. In relation to the herbicides, it was observed that only in the presence of glyphosate and imazetaphyr the conidia germination did not follow the trend of the treatment with water. Bipolaris euphorbiae Muchovej & Carvalho é um forte candidato para o controle de Euphorbia heterophylla L. (amendoim bravo). Este fungo pode ser aplicado em combinação com herbicidas para controlar um maior espectro de espécies daninhas. Para tanto, experimentos laboratoriais foram realizados para verificar a possibilidade da utilização de mistura de tanque de esporos de B. euphorbiae e herbicidas ou surfatantes recomendados para a cultura da soja. Crescimento micelial e germinação de conídios foram avaliados em meio BDA acrescido dos herbicidas, nas concentrações recomendadas dos produtos comerciais, <b>oxasulfuron</b> (80 g/ha), glifosato (4 L/ha), bentazon (1. 5 L/ha), fomesafen (1 L/ha), chlorimuron-ethyl (80 g/ha), lactofen (1 L/ha) e imazetaphyr (1 L/ha) e dos surfatantes Energic (2 ml/L), Aterbane (2, 5 ml/L), Silwet L- 77 Ag (1 ml/L), Herbitensil (2 ml/L) e Natur L'óleo (10 ml/L). Diluições dos herbicidas de 50 % e 25 % foram avaliadas com um consumo de calda equivalente a 300 L/ha. Os surfatantes foram somente utilizados nas concentrações recomendadas. O crescimento micelial não foi afetado por bentazon e fomesafen e apenas levemente por <b>oxasulfuron.</b> Porém, glifosato, chlorimuron-ethyl, lactofen, Energic, Herbitensil, Silwet, e Aterbane o reduziram drasticamente. A redução observada com imazetaphyr foi intermediária e Natur L' óleo promoveu o crescimento micelial. Na presença dos surfatantes, observou-se que todos permitiram uma porcentagem de germinação equivalente àquela alcançada na presença de água. Energic e Herbitensil causaram um retardamento expressivo. Com Herbitensil, o processo germinativo iniciou somente aos 120 minutos.

40|$|Teve-se o objetivo de avaliar a eficiência de um conjunto de equipamentos de proteção {{individual}} no controle das exposições proporcionadas ao tratorista aplicando herbicidas nas culturas de soja e de amendoim com o pulverizador de barra e a segurança dessas condições de trabalho. Os pulverizadores utilizados foram os convencionais empregados nas duas culturas para as aplicações de herbicidas em pré-plantio incorporado (ppi), em pré-emergência (pré) e em pós-emergência inicial (pós), com volumes de 200 L ha- 1, e 150 L ha- 1 apenas na aplicação em pós, na cultura de soja. As exposições sem EPIs foram de 102, 77 mL de calda por dia nas aplicações em ppi, 39, 62 em pré e 47, 14 em pós-emergência. A eficiência dos EPIs no controle das exposições dérmicas foi de 76, 5 % em ppi, 50, 9 % em pré e 75, 3 % em pós-emergência. Na cultura de soja, foram seguras para o tratorista, sem ou com EPIs, as aplicações de pendimethalin, imazaquin e flumetsulam em ppi; de pendimethalin, acetochlor, clomazone, flumioxazin, imazaquin, metribuzin, sulfentrazone, dimethenamid e flumetsulamem em pré, e de bentazone, glyphosate, imazethapyr, quizalofop-ethyl, chlorimuron ethyl e <b>oxasulfuron</b> em pós. Na cultura de amendoim, sem e com EPIs, foi segura a aplicação de pendimethalin em ppi; em pré, a aplicação de alachlor foi classificada como insegura, sem ou com o uso dos EPIs. The aim of {{the study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of a combination of personal protective equipments (PPE) for the tractor operator applying herbicides on soybean and peanut crops with a tractor mounted boom sprayer and the safetyness of these work conditions. The application of the herbicides were in pre-planting soil-incorporated (ppi), pre-emergence (pre) and post-emergence (post) treatment, with volumes of 200 L ha- 1, except in the post application for soybeans where it was 150 L ha- 1. It was shown that exposure with PPE was 102. 77 mL of spray per day in ppi, 39. 62 in pre and 47. 14 in post applications. The effectiveness of PPE in controlling dermal exposure was 76. 5 % in ppi, 50. 9 % in pre and 75. 3 % in post applications.

40|$|Two-year {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} within the three-year maize-soybean-wheat crop rotation {{with the aim}} to assess the influence of two cropping systems, conditionally marked as high-input and reduced-input systems, on soybean dry matter yield and nitrogen concentration in its different plant parts. The high-input system was characterized by: ploughing at 30 - 32 cm, fertilization with 80 kg N and 130 P 2 O 5 and K 2 O kg ha- 1, weed control based on <b>oxasulfuron</b> and, if required, a corrective treatment with propachizafop and bentazone. The reduced-input system involved: ploughing at 20 - 22 cm, fertilization {{with a total of}} 40 kg N and 130 kg P 2 O 5 and K 2 O kg ha- 1, and only oxasulfuron-based weed control. Investigations involved two soybean genotypes: L 940596 and L 910631, vegetation group I. An identical monofactorial trial with four replications was set up in each cropping system. Cropping system intensity had a positive effect on leaf and stem dry matter mass in 2002, and on leaf and stem nitrogen concentration, whereas it had no effect on pod dry matter, seed yield and seed nitrogen concentrations in either year. The highest leaf dry matter was recorded in R 4 development stage and that of stem and pod without seeds in R 7 development stage. In both trial years, the highest nitrogen concentrations in leaf and stem were recorded in R 1 development stage. In both trial years, higher pod nitrogen concentration was achieved in R 4 development stage than in the R 7 stage...|$|E
