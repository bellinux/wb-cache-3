The primate lentiviruses are distinguished by the use of CD4 protein as a receptor and the absence of dUTPase. Some groups have cross-reactive gag antigens (e.g., the <b>ovine,</b> <b>caprine,</b> and feline lentiviruses). Antibodies to gag antigens in lions and other large felids indicate the existence of other as yet unidentified viruses related to feline lentivirus and the ovine/caprine lentiviruses.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Q fever is a {{ubiquitous}} zoonosis {{caused by}} Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular rickettsial organism that caused abortion and stillbirth in ruminants. Approach: The prevalence of Coxiella burnetii in Iran is essentially unknown. Its traditional diagnosis {{is based on}} culture, serology and conventional PCR. In this present study, for more sensitive and accurate detection and prevalence's determination of Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses, the nested and real-time PCR methods are recommended. Results: About 98 (12. 53 %) and 122 (16. 39 %) out of 782 and 744 <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> aborted fetuses, were positive for presence of Coxiella burnetii by nested PCR, respectively. After LSI Taqvet Coxiella burnetii real-time PCR, it was recognized that 121 (15. 47 %) and 152 (20. 43 %) samples were positive for Coxiella burnetii in <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> aborted fetuses, respectively. Results indicated that the real-time PCR was 7 times more sensitive than the nested PCR. Statistical analysis showed significant differences about P Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses by both nested and real-time PCR assays and P Coxiella burnetii. The Ct values which obtained from real-time PCR had significant differences about P Coxiella burnetii between aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses. Our results indicated that Caprine is more sensitive than Ovine to Coxiella burnetiis abortion Khozestan and Gilan have the highest and Khorasan and Sistan va Baluchistan provinces have the lowest prevalence of Coxiella burnetii, respectively. Conclusion: To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first prevalence report of direct identification of Coxiella burnetii in aborted <b>Ovine</b> and <b>Caprine</b> fetuses by evaluation of nested and real-time PCR assays in Iran.

Ninety-three colonies, from 31 of the 54 samples (57. 4 %) and from 18 (69. 2 %) of the 26 farms of origin tested positive for SEs/SEls genes.

Most of the strains (73 %) possessed the f 17 cA structural subunit gene, whereas the f 17 aA and f 17 dA genes were detected only on three (6 %) and two (4 %) strains, respectively. The f 17 bA gene was not detected. All but one of these strains possessed the f 17 G genes of the adhesin subfamily II. The only strain having the f 17 G gene of subfamily I possessed the structural subunit gene f 17 dA. Sequencing of the f 17 A and f 17 G genes of four selected strains confirmed the association of f 17 cA and f 17 dA structural subunit genes with the f 17 G genes of the adhesin subfamily II.

40|$|In the Iberian Peninsula, the proteinases {{present in}} the flowers {{of members of the}} Cynara genus, C. cardunculus, C. humilis and C. scolymus, have for many years been {{successfully}} used in the manufacture of traditional cheeses from <b>ovine</b> and/or <b>caprine</b> milk on individual farms (Vieira de Sá & Barbosa, 1972; Trujillo et al. 1994). In Portugal, C. cardunculus is the species most frequently employed. Although commercial thistle was tentatively assumed to be pure in taxonomic terms, accurate analyses have shown that the flowers of C. cardunculus are often mixed with flowers of C. humilis (Pires et al. 1994). The clotting activity of C. humilis is due to an aspartic proteinase, currently designated cardosin A and similar to another enzyme obtained from C. cardunculus. This enzyme is similar in specificity and activity to chymosin (Pires et al. 1994). The action of cardosin A from C. cardunculus upon <b>ovine</b> and <b>caprine</b> caseins has been reported recently (Ramalho-Santos et al. 1996; Simo 4 es, 1998; Sousa & Malcata, 1998), but as yet there is no information on the proteolytic activity of the proteinase from C. humilis upon caseins from milks other than bovine.
