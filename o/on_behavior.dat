25|$|Some critics view {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a form}} of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that {{evolutionary psychology}} does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes <b>on</b> <b>behavior</b> in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes <b>on</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

Behavior {{was a result}} of internal and external factors such as stimulus and response. Many factors can affect of children <b>behavior</b> <b>on</b> oral health maintenance. This study aims is to identify factors affecting children <b>behavior</b> <b>on</b> oral health maintenance. The study is an observational research with a cross sectional design and all that met inclusion criteria were sampled. Questionnaires with Likert scale were used to assess attitudes, perception, motivation, and behavior variables. The questionnaires showed validity (correlation values ≥ 0. 30) and reliability (alpha Cronbach ≥ 0. 70). The result of multiple regression analysis showed that variables attitude (p = 0. 163) did not affect significantly <b>on</b> the <b>behavior.</b> Variables perception (p = 0. 017) and motivation (p = 0. 006) affected significantly <b>on</b> the <b>behavior.</b> Variables of perception and motivation contribute 40. 0 % (R 2 = 0. 400) to children <b>behavior</b> <b>on</b> oral health maintenance. Motivation gave the highest contribution of 10. 4 % to children <b>behavior</b> <b>on</b> oral health maintenance.
