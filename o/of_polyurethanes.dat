40|$|BackgroundPolyurethane {{coating of}} breast {{implants}} {{has been shown}} to reduce capsular contracture in short-term follow-up studies. This 30 -year study is the longest examination of the use of polyurethane-coated implants and their correlation with capsular contracture. MethodsThis study evaluates the senior surgeon's (F. D. P.) experience with the use of polyurethane-coated implants in aesthetic breast augmentation in 382 patients over 30 years. Follow-up evaluations were conducted for six months after surgery. After the six-month follow-up period, 76 patients returned for reoperation. The gross findings, histology, and associated capsular contracture were noted at the time of explantation. ResultsNo patient during the six-month follow-up period demonstrated capsular contracture. For those who underwent reoperation for capsular contracture, Baker II/III contractures were noted nine to 10 years after surgery and Baker IV contractures were noted 12 to 21 years after surgery. None of the explanted implants had macroscopic evidence <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane,</b> which was only found during the first five years after surgery. The microscopic presence <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> was noted in all capsules up to 30 years after the original operation. ConclusionsAn inverse correlation was found between the amount <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> coating on the implant and the occurrence of capsular contracture. Increasingly severe capsular contracture was associated with a decreased amount <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> coating {{on the surface of the}} implants. No contracture occurred in patients whose implants showed incomplete biodegradation <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane,</b> as indicated by the visible presence <b>of</b> <b>polyurethane</b> coating.

50|$|While polyesters {{dominate}} {{both the}} research and industrial focus on synthetic biodegradable polymers, other classes of polymers are also of interest. Polyanhydrides are an active area of research in drug delivery because they only degrade from the surface and so are able to release the drug they carry at a constant rate. Polyanhydrides can be made via {{a variety of methods}} also used in the synthesis of other polymers, including condensation, dehydrochlorination, dehydrative coupling, and ROP. Polyurethanes and poly(ester amide)s are used in biomaterials. Polyurethanes were initially used for their biocompatibility, durability, resilience, but are more recently being investigated for their biodegradability. Polyurethanes are typically synthesized using a diisocyanate, a diol, and a polymer chain extender. The initial reaction is carried out between the diisocyanate and the diol, with the diisocyanate in excess to ensure that the ends of the new polymer chain are isocyanate groups. This polymer can then be reacted with either a diol or a diamine to form urethane or urethane-urea end groups, respectively. The choice of terminal groups affects the properties of the resulting polymer. Additionally, the use of vegetable oil and biomass in the formation <b>of</b> <b>polyurethanes,</b> as well as the conversion <b>of</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> to polyols, is an active area of research.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{desirable}} attributes <b>of</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> is their ability to be turned into foam.

The gas can be carbon dioxide, either generated by reacting isocyanate with water or added as a gas; it also be produced by boiling volatile liquids.

The liquids can be HFC-245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane) and HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), and hydrocarbons such as n-pentane.The balance between gellation and blowing is sensitive to operating parameters including the concentrations of water and catalyst. The reaction to generate carbon dioxide involves water reacting with an isocyanate first forming an unstable carbamic acid, which then decomposes into carbon dioxide and an amine. The amine reacts with more isocyanate to give a substituted urea. Water has a very low molecular weight, so even though the weight percent of water may be small, the molar proportion of water may be high and considerable amounts of urea produced. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate [...] "hard segment" [...] phases consisting mostly of polyurea. The concentration and organization of these polyurea phases can have a significant impact on the properties of the polyurethane foam.|$|E
