60|$|There {{was no room}} in {{the prison}} for <b>ordinary</b> <b>offences</b> against the {{criminal}} code; they were overfilled already with so-called traitors against the Republic.|$|R
50|$|The Treachery Act {{was deemed}} {{necessary}} because treason still {{had its own}} special rules of evidence and procedure which made it a difficult offence to prove and prosecute (see Treason Act 1695). The new offence of treachery, a felony, was designed to make securing convictions easier {{as it could be}} proved under the same rules of evidence as <b>ordinary</b> <b>offences.</b> It was also needed because there was doubt whether the treason laws were applicable to German saboteurs.|$|R
50|$|This move to {{establish}} a sound definition of terrorism in the law {{made it possible to}} build an entirely new set of police and investigatory powers into incidents of this kind, beyond what they could do for <b>ordinary</b> violent <b>offences.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to remember, therefore, that to be convicted of an offence in terms of section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act is to be convicted of a unique statutory offence, described in detail above, and not of the <b>ordinary</b> common-law <b>offence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In England, {{there was}} no clear common law {{definition}} of treason; {{it was for the}} king and his judges to determine if an offence constituted treason. Thus, the process became open to abuse, and decisions were often arbitrary. For instance, during the reign of Edward III, a knight was convicted of treason because he assaulted one of the king's subjects and held him for a ransom of £90. It was only in 1351 that Parliament passed legislation on the subject of treason. Under the Treason Act 1351, or [...] "Statute of Treasons", which distinguished between high and petty treason, several distinct offences constitute high treason; most of them continue to do so, while those relating to forgery have been relegated to <b>ordinary</b> <b>offences.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} used in the {{execution}} {{of those who had}} committed <b>ordinary</b> criminal <b>offences.</b> On occasion, it is said, the person to be executed was led through a series of corridors, not knowing when or where the shot takes place. Even after the break up of the Soviet Union, people continued to be executed by shooting. The mass murderer Andrei Chikatilo was executed in this way in 1994, just before Russia halted use of the death penalty as part of its accession to the Council of Europe.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 May 1947, 16-year-old Alexander Rubowitz {{disappeared}} while {{putting up}} posters for Jewish paramilitary group Lehi. Palestine police CID {{believed he had}} been caught and killed by Farran's squad; Gurney ordered them [...] "to proceed with the case as an <b>ordinary</b> criminal <b>offence</b> with the object of bringing Farran and any other accused to trial". According to an account ruled inadmissible at Farran's trial, Rubowitz {{was taken to a}} remote location where, after brutal attempts to extract information, he was killed by Farran with a rock and the body given to an Arab for disposal. His body was never found. Suspicions of Farran's involvement were first raised after a grey trilby hat, bearing worn lettering compatible with his name, was found near the street corner where a struggling Rubowitz was seen being pushed into a car. Farran claimed he was being framed and fled to Syria. Colonel Bernard Fergusson persuaded Farran to return voluntarily. However, when, contrary to Fergusson's assurances, he was arrested, Farran escaped to Jordan, finally returning when he heard of reprisals being planned against British officers. He was brought to trial in a British military court in Jerusalem.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of my sociological research regarding full-time and extramural students’ attitudes towards bribery as a common form of corruption. The research encompassed 480 students representing the following areas of study: computer science, management, marketing, pedagogy, sociology, philosophy, law and Catholic theology. The attitudes of students towards bribery were correlated with four independent variables: sex, mode of study (full-time and extramural), field of study, and having a religious or non-religious (laic, secular) worldview. The study illustrates that student’s attitude towards corruption, including bribery depends most on whether the subject represents a religious or a non-religious outlook. The religious students are characterized by a deeper moral sensitivity than are non-religious students, and therefore more often morally condemn giving and accepting bribes, as well as other forms of corruption. The students of Catholic theology condemned bribery most strongly, compared to the students of other areas of studies. More than one-forth of the students surveyed admitted giving or receiving a bribe at least ones in their lifetime, including some of the theology students. However, 72 % of the students surveyed did not have any personal experience associated with bribery. According to these students, bribery and other forms of corruption are morally illicit. In the legal dimension, they are simply <b>ordinary</b> criminal <b>offences,</b> and should be opposed in any place and at any time. In students’ moral appraisal bribery is a „contiguous” phenomenon, and it is easily passed on from the elder generation (parents) to the younger (children). The students expressed their opinion that corruption in Poland, and bribery in particular, is an insidious social plague, visible in every sphere of social life, and difficult to combat. Bribery seems to have a moral license in Poland as sometimes it is the „only” way to have something done expediently...|$|R
6000|$|On my father's {{side the}} matter is more complex. The history of the [...] family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my [...] own, by Sir William Fraser, the highest living authority.[2] He has [...] carried us up to a rather remote period, I think before Elizabeth, [...] but {{has not yet been}} able to connect us with the {{earliest}} known [...] holders of the name, which with the aid of charter-chests he hopes [...] to do. Some things are plain and not without interest. They were a [...] race of borderers. There is still an old Gledstanes or Gladstone [...] castle. They formed a family in Sweden in the seventeenth century. [...] The explanation of this may have been that, when the union of the [...] crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service [...] like Sir Dugald Dalgetty under Gustavus Adolphus, and in this case [...] passed from service to settlement. I have never heard of them in [...] Scotland until after the Restoration, otherwise than as persons of [...] family. At that period there are traces of their having been fined [...] by public authority, but not for any <b>ordinary</b> criminal <b>offence.</b> [...] From this time forward I find no trace of their gentility. During [...] the eighteenth century they are, I think, principally traced by a [...] line of maltsters (no doubt a small business then) in Lanarkshire. [...] Their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of Biggar. [...] I remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of [...] that branch, either in 1820 or some years earlier, who was a small [...] watchmaker in that town. He was of the same generation as my [...] father, but came, I understood, from a senior brother of the [...] family. I do not know whether his line is extinct. There also seem [...] to be some stray Gladstones who are found at Yarmouth and in [...] Yorkshire.[3] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} what I mean, citizens; you think I am mad, or drunk, or a traitor like Déroulède? Eh bien! {{give me your}} attention five minutes longer, and you shall see. Let me suppose that we have reached {{the moment when the}} woman--what is her name? Oh! ah! yes! Juliette Marny--stands in the Hall of Justice on her trial before the Committee of Public Safety. Citizen Foucquier-Tinville, one of our greatest patriots, reads the indictment against her: the papers surreptitiously burnt, the torn, mysterious letter-case found in her room. If these are presumed, in the indictment, to be treasonable correspondence with the enemies of the Republic, condemnation follows at once, then the guillotine. There is no defence, no respite. The Minister of Justice, according to Article IX of the Law framed by himself, allows no advocate to those directly accused of treason. But," [...] continued the giant, with slow and calm impressiveness, [...] "in the case of <b>ordinary,</b> civil indictments, <b>offences</b> against public morality or matters pertaining to the penal code, the Minister of Justice allows the accused to be publicly defended. Place Juliette Marny in the dock on a treasonable charge, she will be hustled out of the court in a few minutes, amongst a batch of other traitors, dragged back to her own prison, and executed in the early dawn, before Déroulède has had time to frame a plan for her safety or defence. If, then, he tries to move heaven and earth to rescue the woman he loves, the mob of Paris may,--who knows?--take his part warmly. They are mad where Déroulède is concerned; and we all know that two devoted lovers have ere now found favour with the people of France--a curious remnant of sentimentalism, I suppose--and the popular Citizen-Deputy knows better than anyone else on earth, how to play upon the sentimental feelings of the populace. Now, {{in the case of a}} penal offence, mark where the difference would be! The woman Juliette Marny, arraigned for wantonness, for an offence against public morals; the burnt correspondence, admitted to be the letters of a lover--her hatred for Déroulède suggesting the false denunciation. Then the Minister of Justice allows an advocate to defend her. She has none in court; but think you Déroulède would not step forward, and bring all the fervour of his eloquence to bear in favour of his mistress? Can you hear his impassioned speech on her behalf?--I can--the rope, I tell you, citizens, with which he'll hang himself. Will he admit in open court that the burnt correspondence was another lover's letters? No!--a thousand times no!--and, in the face of his emphatic denial of the existence of another lover for Juliette, it will be for our clever Public Prosecutor to bring him down to an admission that the correspondence was his, that it was treasonable, that she burnt them to save him." ...|$|R
