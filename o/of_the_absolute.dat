5|$|By the 1920s {{a series}} of new palaces were {{constructed}} elsewhere for the king's use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual {{move out of the}} palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absolute</b> monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} the uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absolute</b> infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absolute</b> value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E
