5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and <b>overreliance</b> on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E

25|$|Constant {{exposure}} to a toxin creates evolutionary pressure for pests resistant to that toxin. <b>Overreliance</b> on glyphosate {{and a reduction in}} the diversity of weed management practices allowed the spread of glyphosate resistance in 14 weed species/biotypes in the US.|$|E
25|$|Veblen {{and other}} American institutionalists were {{indebted to the}} German Historical School, {{especially}} Gustav von Schmoller, for the emphasis on historical fact, their empiricism and especially a broad, evolutionary framework of study. Veblen admired Schmoller, but criticized some other leaders of the German school because of their <b>overreliance</b> on descriptions, long displays of numerical data and narratives of industrial development that rested on no underlying economic theory. Veblen tried {{to use the same}} approach with his own theory added.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Davis {{had been}} clearly {{struggling}} with his game, displaying the classic {{symptoms of a}} confidence problem in his technique. His cue action, which was once regarded by his peers as {{the best in the}} game, was now in tatters, with Davis seemingly unable to settle on a feathering up drill, going from slow and deliberate in some matches to randomly speeding up in others. He also soon brought comments from commentators with regard to his <b>overreliance</b> on safety play, and over thinking his shots. It was clear that Davis had a serious problem and ultimately one he would never recover from. 1989 proved to be his last appearance in a World Final, unthinkable at the time.|$|E
25|$|Skepticism {{concerning}} {{the role of}} mathematics in academic economics and in economic decision making. Despite his degree in mathematics, Keynes remained skeptical about the usefulness of mathematical models for solving economic problems. Mathematics, however, became increasingly central to economics even during Keynes' career, {{and even more so}} in the decades following his death. While the Keynesian resurgence has seen no general reversal of opinion on the utility of complex math, there have been numerous calls for a broadening of economics to make further use of disciplines other than mathematics. In the practical spheres of banking and finance, there have been warnings against <b>overreliance</b> on mathematical models, which have been held up as one of the contributing causes of the 2008–09 crises.|$|E
25|$|Martin {{originally}} {{planned for the}} fourth book to be called A Dance with Dragons with the story picking up {{five years after the}} events of A Storm of Swords (primarily to advance the ages of the younger characters). However, during the writing process it was discovered that this was leading to an <b>overreliance</b> on flashbacks to fill in the gap. After twelve months or so of working on the book, Martin decided to abandon much of what had previously been written and start again, this time picking up immediately after the end of A Storm of Swords. He announced this decision, along with the new title A Feast for Crows, at Worldcon in Philadelphia on September 1, 2001. He also announced that A Dance with Dragons would now be the fifth book in the sequence.|$|E
25|$|In Nigeria, school {{counseling}} began in 1959 and exists in some high schools. It rarely exists {{at the elementary}} school level. Where there are federally funded secondary schools, there are some professionally trained school counselors. However, in many cases, there are only teachers who function as career masters/mistresses. School counselors often have teaching and other responsibilities that take time away from their {{school counseling}} tasks. The Counseling Association of Nigeria (CASSON) was formed in 1976 to promote the profession, but there is no code of ethics. However, a certification/licensure board has been formed. Aluede, Adomeh, & Afen-Akpaida (2004) discussed the <b>overreliance</b> on textbooks from the USA and the need for school counselors in Nigeria to take a whole-school approach and lessen the focus on individual approaches and honor the traditional African world view that values the family and community's roles in decision-making as paramount for effective decision-making in schools.|$|E
25|$|The Ca.331 O.A. won {{widespread}} {{praise from}} both the Italian and German pilots—including German fighter ace Werner Mölders (1913–1941) -- who tested it, and {{the chief of the}} German Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring (1893–1946), was given a demonstration of its capabilities at Guidonia Montecelio in January 1942. The reasons for the lack of a production order by either Italy or Germany remain obscure and a matter of debate. Reasons given by various sources include a supposed <b>overreliance</b> on the use of materials in the Ca.331s construction that may have been in scarce supply (although this itself is controversial) in wartime Italy and Germany; the use of too many parts in the Ca.331, uncommon with other Italian aircraft (although {{it is not clear what}} specifically these may have been); political problems that Caproni company founder Gianni Caproni (1886–1957) may have had with the Italian Fascist government (which have not been identified clearly); an unwillingness of the Italian military to cooperate too closely with their German counterparts for fear of being dominated by Germany in the event of a German victory in World War II; or simply that the Ca.331 was under development for so long that the requirement for it disappeared before it could enter production, a common problem in the Italian aircraft industry during the World War II years.|$|E
500|$|... "Kingdom Come" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it [...] "a particularly superficial addition to the series". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the [...] "awkward" [...] performances and [...] "cheesy" [...] approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as [...] "an episode {{about a man who}} finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from [...] "the typical Millennium problems", including [...] "an <b>overreliance</b> on trite philosophical dialogue"; however, he found that it contained [...] "something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely". The episode's thematic concern with {{the role of religion in}} society was noted as being [...] "the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Kingdom Come" [...] 5 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "classic Millennium". Gibron felt that the episode had [...] "an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell everything out for us up front", and noted that it served as [...] "the blueprint for all better Millennium episodes to come".|$|E
500|$|Modern {{appreciation}} of the film has seen its standing among critics improve. Salon.com called Mann's original {{the best of the}} Lecter series, and Slate magazine described it as [...] "mesmerizing", positing that it directly inspired television series such as Millennium and , though calling attention to its [...] "Miami-Vice-like <b>overreliance</b> on synthesized sludge". The Independent called it [...] "the most aestheticised film of the 1980s", and noted its [...] "chilly integrity". British television channel and production company Film4 called it [...] "the most refined screen adaptation of Harris' books", although they found the film's contemporary soundtrack [...] "dated". Sky Movies echoed this sentiment, summing up their review by saying [...] "although it still remains a classic, the film has dated slightly." [...] Retrospective reviews tend to be less critical of the stylized visuals: the BBC's Ali Barclay called the film [...] "a truly suspenseful, stylish thriller", awarding it four out of five stars, and Nathan Ditum described it in Total Film as [...] "complex, disturbing and super-stylish", adding that the 2002 remake could not compete with it. Empire editor Mark Dinning gave the film five stars out of five, praising the [...] "subtlety" [...] of the acting and the [...] "neon angst" [...] of the visuals. Television channel Bravo named Dollarhyde's interrogation of Freddy Lounds as one of its 30 Even Scarier Movie Moments in 2007, and Noonan's portrayal of Dollarhyde was praised by Simon Abrams of UGO Networks as [...] "a highlight of his career".|$|E
500|$|... {{today the}} film has more of a mixed reception, with many critics believing that the film relies on its (now-dated) extravagance and is too long; Christopher Null stated that The Great Ziegfeld is a [...] "textbook case of how a film can lose its appeal over the years". Since its release {{the film has}} been criticized in {{particular}} for being unnecessarily lengthy and its overacting (particularly by Rainer), and is occasionally cited as a [...] "prime example of the Academy's fallibility" [...] {{in a year when}} other critically acclaimed pictures such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town were released, which some argue was more deserving of Best Picture. The consensus today on the review site Rotten Tomatoes is that although the [...] "biopic is undeniably stylish", it [...] "loses points for excessive length, an <b>overreliance</b> on clichés, and historical inaccuracies", and has a 65% fresh rating. Emily W. Leider claims the film to be [...] "more remarkable for its [...] "legs and tinsel" [...] extravagance than for its excellence." [...] David Parkinson of Empire magazine gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and concluded that it [...] "Drags in places and doesn't even try for a true-to-life portrait of the great theatre entrepreneur but it's shiny and big spectacle with impressive choreography." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called it [...] "amazingly dull, even with William Powell in the lead and guest appearances by the likes of Ray Bolger and Fanny Brice." [...] Emanuel Levy gave it a C grade and stated that it was [...] "overlong and overblown but ultimately mediocre as a musical movie and as a biopic of the legendary showman." [...] James Berardinelli awarded it 2.5 out of 4 stars and stated that [...] "although some of the production's technical aspects remain impressive, the dramatic elements come across as trite and many of the musical numbers are dated", but said that it was a [...] "reasonably competent – albeit [...] "airbrushed" [...] – presentation of the main character's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Business Weekly published on June 25, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the United States does not want see Taiwan's independence being threatened or undermined. Pointing to the crisis in Ukraine, she further warned {{that the loss of}} economic independence will affect Taiwan's political independence, and that <b>overreliance</b> on China will leave Taiwan vulnerable. While thanking Clinton for reminding Taiwan to act [...] "carefully and smartly" [...] when dealing with China, the Mainland Affairs Council said Taiwan's steady promotion of exchanges with China has not led to over-dependence on China, and that Taiwan has not lost economic and political independence.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{began with}} French author Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel La Planète des Singes. Boulle wrote the novel {{in six months}} after the [...] "humanlike expressions" [...] of gorillas at the zoo {{inspired}} him to contemplate the relationship between man and ape. La Planète des Singes was heavily influenced by 18th- and 19th-century fantastical travel narratives, especially Jonathan Swift's satirical Gulliver's Travels. It is one of several of Boulle's works to use science fiction tropes and plot devices to comment on the failings of human nature and mankind's <b>overreliance</b> on technology. However, Boulle rejected the science fiction label for his work, instead terming it [...] "social fantasy".|$|E
2500|$|While {{some claim}} that phone text {{messaging}} {{is the primary}} cause of character amnesia, the phenomenon, at least in Japan, appears to originate with widespread use of word processors. An article in the Asahi Shimbun from 23 September 1985, reports that students were finding it increasingly difficult to remember how to write even quite simple kanji by hand since the full-scale introduction of word processors at a university campus in Isehara. A 1993 survey of members of the Information Processing Society of Japan found that habitual word processor users reported declining ability to write characters by hand. The Japanese term [...] describes a person whose handwriting ability has deteriorated due to <b>overreliance</b> on computer input methods.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 and 2005, {{along with}} {{research}} for the sand tiger shark, there was {{research for the}} broadnose sevengill shark for development techniques for semen collection and artificial insemination to potentially increase breeding and lower <b>overreliance</b> on natural mating. Research in 2010 found that this shark has very poorly calcified vertebrae that cannot be used for age and growth estimations. Research in 2009 in [...] (RD) and [...] (SJ), Argentina found that females were larger in RD than SJ and the heaviest female in RD was 70kg while it was 36.9kg in SJ. For the males, the heaviest in RD was 40kg while it was 32.5 in SJ. Both locations also found the most significant to occur December and January.|$|E
2500|$|A {{detailed}} and political work, {{it has been}} underused by historians of the late Carolingians. It may have been written at the bequest or insistence of Odo of France, who appears as the hero and [...] "future king" [...] (rex futurus) in the poem. The poet views Odo {{through the lens of}} the 890s. He praises Odo as [...] "the noblest" [...] of the city of Paris, more so than Askericus or Joscelin. Abbo also presents the Emperor Charles III, whom he refers to as basileus Francorum ("emperor of the Franks"), in a positive light. The poem stresses the magnitude and diversity of the united Frankish empire. Significantly, he places no blame on the emperor for the siege of Paris nor for the subsequent harrying of Burgundy, which he actually considered to be appropriate for the Burgundians' refusal to aid the city. Abbo even warns the Neustrians not to use [...] "the purple to keep warm", a reference to <b>overreliance</b> on imperial protection, purple being an imperial colour. The term basileus is likewise a distinctly Byzantine term.|$|E
2500|$|Midnight Oil {{undertook}} {{more politically}} motivated benefit concerts, including organising the Stop the Drop Nuclear Disarmament concert in 1983 which received a United Nations Media Peace Prize. 10 to 1 {{was followed by}} Red Sails in the Sunset in October 1984, which was recorded in Japan, produced by Launay again. It peaked at No.1 for four weeks on the Australian charts, and charted on the Billboard 200. Singles from the album were released in US and UK but had no chart success. Whilst the album showed an <b>overreliance</b> on technical wizardry, their lyrical stance was positive. The band continued to expand their sound and explore themes of politics, consumerism, militarism, {{the threat of nuclear}} war and environmental issues. The album cover by Japanese artist Tsunehisa Kimura featured a photomontage of Sydney – both city and harbour – cratered and devastated after a hypothetical nuclear attack. Live concert footage of [...] "Short Memory" [...] was used in the Australian independent anti-nuclear war movie One Night Stand. A promotional video for [...] "Best of Both Worlds", later on Best of Both Worlds, received airplay worldwide on cable music TV station MTV.|$|E
