40|$|Serbian conservationists {{could learn}} a lot from the {{revitalization}} example of the Old city of Bern. Analyses of this example show that the method of revitalization and protection of listed, but abandoned and inhabited, buildings depends on its future use. Alone analyses of future purpose of built heritage cannot be used as a method for its revitalization. The use of new ideas based on historical importance of the protected building generates the building's structures. The approach of revitalization through the process of building structuring and adaptation to new purpose has been tested through different analyses. It was found that the future purpose of building cannot be determined only by defining the revitalization method, set by public body, but in this process the future <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> should actively participate.
