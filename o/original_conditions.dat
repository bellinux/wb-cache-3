5|$|The vast {{majority}} of improvements to this reaction have focused on rendering the transformation catalytic {{with respect to the}} palladium salt, primarily due to its high cost. The <b>original</b> <b>conditions,</b> though technically catalytic, still require 50 mol% of palladium(II) actetate, raising the cost to prohibitively high levels for large scale syntheses.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} <b>original</b> <b>conditions.</b> The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered from the <b>original</b> <b>conditions</b> {{by the presence}} of life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} GCCS operations, the General Post Office (GPO) {{established}} a training school, and a women's {{teacher training college}} was opened in 1948. The Ministry of Aviation also opened the Navaid training school on part of the site. The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of the site, and other blocks were adapted from their <b>original</b> <b>conditions</b> for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on the site within Blocks C and D until 1987. Aerial masts which had been erected by the division became unusable after the nearby train line was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Malaysian Navy's five naval {{stations}} were originally built on outlying atolls, {{with the most}} developed Station Lima now expanded to a comfortably habitable naval station and also a popular diving spot in the region, in contrast with its harsh <b>original</b> <b>conditions</b> in 1983. On 21 June 1980 a claim plaque was erected {{on the island and}} three years later eighteen PASKAL men went ashore on May 1983 to build the first encampment while braving the elements. At the time, the only infrastructure available was a helipad for personnel transfer and the soldiers had to camp under the open skies on the bare reef. When the naval station proper was constructed six years later with the construction of a small living-cum-operations quarters, it was also decided that the enlarged island the atoll had become would also be developed as a tourist attraction so that the tourism potential of the island could be exploited.|$|E
500|$|Like the Grey Cup, {{awarded to}} {{the winner of the}} Canadian Football League, the Stanley Cup is {{engraved}} with the names of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff. However, this was not always the case: one of Lord Stanley's <b>original</b> <b>conditions</b> was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring to the Cup to commemorate their victory. Initially, there was only one base ring, which was attached {{to the bottom of the}} original bowl by the Montreal Hockey Club. Clubs engraved their team names, usually in the form [...] "TEAM NAME" [...] "YEAR WON", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no more room to engrave their names (and unwilling to pay for a second band), teams left their mark on the bowl itself. The 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowl's interior surface, and the first champion to record the name of every member of their team.|$|E

6000|$|There may be {{an excess}} even of informing light. Niépce, a Frenchman, {{discovered}} [...] "actinism," [...] that power in the sun's rays which produces a chemical effect,--that granite rocks, and stone structures, and statues of metal, [...] "are all alike destructively acted upon during the hours of sunshine, and, but for provisions of Nature no less wonderful, would soon perish under the delicate touch of the most subtile of the agencies of the universe." [...] But he observed that [...] "those bodies which underwent this change during the daylight possessed the power of restoring themselves to their <b>original</b> <b>conditions</b> during the hours of night, when this excitement was no-longer influencing them." [...] Hence it has been inferred that [...] "the hours of darkness are as necessary to the inorganic creation as we know night and sleep are to the organic kingdom." [...] Not even does the moon shine every night, but gives place to darkness.|$|E
6000|$|It was at {{any rate}} {{strictly}} impossible to me {{to make an appointment}} for the day as to which I have just recorded Nina's proposal; and the turn of events since then has not quickened my eagerness. Mrs. Munden remained in correspondence with Mrs. Brash--to the extent, that is, of three letters, each of which she showed me. They so told to our imagination her terrible little story that we were quite prepared--or thought we were--for her going out like a snuffed candle. She resisted, on her return to her <b>original</b> <b>conditions,</b> less than a year; the taste of the tree, as I had called it, had been fatal to her; what she had contentedly enough lived without before for half a century she couldn't now live without for a day. I know nothing of her original conditions--some minor American city--save that for her to have gone back to them was clearly to have stepped out of her frame. We performed, Mrs. Munden and I, a small funeral service for her by talking it all over and making it all out. It wasn't--the minor American city--a market for Holbeins, and what had occurred was that the poor old picture, banished from its museum and refreshed by the rise of no new movement to hang it, was capable of the miracle of a silent revolution; of itself turning, in its dire dishonour, its face to the wall. So it stood, without the intervention of the ghost of a critic, till they happened to pull it round again and find it mere dead paint. Well, it had had, if that's anything, its season of fame, its name on a thousand tongues and printed in capitals in the catalogue. We hadn't been at fault. I haven't, all the same, the least note of her--not a scratch. And I did her so in intention! Mrs. Munden continues to remind me, however, {{that this is not the}} sort of rendering with which, on the other side, after all, Lady Beldonald proposes to content herself. She has come back to the question of her own portrait. Let me settle it then at last. Since she will have the real thing--well, hang it, she shall! ...|$|E
60|$|But {{does the}} {{utilitarian}} doctrine deny that people desire virtue, or maintain that virtue {{is not a}} thing to be desired? The very reverse. It maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, {{but that it is}} to be desired disinterestedly, for itself. Whatever may be the opinion of utilitarian moralists as to the <b>original</b> <b>conditions</b> by which virtue is made virtue; however they may believe (as they do) that actions and dispositions are only virtuous because they promote another end than virtue; yet this being granted, and it having been decided, from considerations of this description, what is virtuous, they not only place virtue at the very head of the things which are good as means to the ultimate end, but they also recognise as a psychological fact the possibility of its being, to the individual, a good in itself, without looking to any end beyond it; and hold, that the mind is not in a right state, not in a state conformable to Utility, not in the state most conducive to the general happiness, unless it does love virtue in this manner--as a thing desirable in itself, even although, in the individual instance, it should not produce those other desirable consequences which it tends to produce, and on account of which it is held to be virtue. This opinion is not, in the smallest degree, a departure from the Happiness principle. The ingredients of happiness are very various, and each of them is desirable in itself, and not merely when considered as swelling an aggregate. The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any given exemption from pain, as for example health, are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness, and to be desired on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for themselves; besides being means, they {{are a part of the}} end. Virtue, according to the utilitarian doctrine, is not naturally and originally part of the end, but it is capable of becoming so; and in those who love it disinterestedly it has become so, and is desired and cherished, not as a means to happiness, but as a part of their happiness.|$|E

60|$|The Australians {{sometimes}} introduce crude decorative {{attempts at}} designing the human figure, {{as in the}} pointed shield opposite (Fig. 2, a), which, with the other Australian designs, are from Mr. Brough Smyth's 'Aborigines of Victoria.' But these ambitious efforts usually end in failure. Though the Australians chiefly confine themselves to decorative art, there are numbers of wall-paintings, so to speak, in the caves of the country which prove that they, like the Bushmen, could design the human figure in action when they pleased. Their usual preference for the employment of patterns appears {{to me to be}} the result of the nature of their materials. In modern art our mechanical advantages and facilities are so great that we are always carrying the method and manner of one art over the frontier of another. Our poetry aims at producing the effects of music; our prose at producing the effects of poetry. Our sculpture tries to vie with painting in the representation of action, or with lace- making in the production of reticulated surfaces, and so forth. But the savage, in his art, has sense enough to confine himself to the sort of work for which his materials are fitted. Set him in the bush with no implements and materials but a bit of broken shell and a lump of hard wood, and he confines himself to decorative scratches. Place the black in the large cave which Pundjel, the Australian Zeus, inhabited when on earth (as Zeus inhabited the cave in Crete), and give the black plenty of red and white ochre and charcoal, and he will paint the human figure in action on the rocky walls. Later, we will return to the cave-paintings of the Australians and the Bushmen in South Africa. At present we must trace purely decorative art a little further. But we must remember that there was once a race apparently in much the same social condition as the Australians, but far more advanced and ingenious in art. The earliest men of the European Continent, about whom we know much, the men whose bones and whose weapons are found beneath the gravel-drift, the men who were contemporary with the rhinoceros, mammoth, and cave-bear, were not further advanced in material civilisation than the Australians. They used weapons of bone, of unpolished stone, and probably of hard wood. But the remnants of their art, the scraps of mammoth or reindeer bone in our museums, prove that they had a most spirited style of sketching from the life. In a collection of drawings on bone (probably designed with a flint or a shell), drawings by palaeolithic man, in the British Museum, I have only observed one purely decorative attempt. Even in this the decoration resembles an effort to use the outlines of foliage for ornamental purposes. In almost all the other cases the palaeolithic artist has not decorated his bits of bone in the usual savage manner, but has treated his bone as an artist treats his sketch-book, and has scratched outlines of beasts and fishes with his sharp shell as an artist uses his point. These ancient bones, in short, are the sketch-books of European savages, whose untaught skill was far greater than that of the Australians, or even of the Eskimo. When brought into contact with Europeans, the Australian and Eskimo very quickly, even without regular teaching, learn to draw with some spirit and skill. In the Australian stele, or grave-pillar, which we have engraved (Fig. 4), the shapeless figures below the men and animals are the dead, and the boilyas or ghosts. Observe the patterns in the interstices. The artist had lived with Europeans. In their <b>original</b> <b>conditions,</b> however, the Australians have not attained to such free, artist-like, and unhampered use of their rude materials as the mysterious European artists who drew the mammoth that walked abroad amongst them.|$|E
