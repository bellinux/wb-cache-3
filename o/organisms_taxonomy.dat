Transfer function performance should theoretically be expected to decrease with reduced taxonomic resolution. However for many groups of <b>organisms</b> <b>taxonomy</b> is imperfect and species level identification not always possible. We conducted numerical experiments on five testate amoeba water table (DWT) transfer function data sets. We sequentially {{reduced the number of}} taxonomic groups by successively merging morphologically similar species and removing inconspicuous species. We then assessed how these changes affected model performance and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction using two fossil data sets. Model performance decreased with decreasing taxonomic resolution, but this had only limited effects on patterns of inferred DWT, at least to detect major dry/wet shifts. Higher-resolution taxonomy may however still be useful to detect more subtle changes, or for reconstructed shifts to be significant...|$|E

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) envelope glycoprotein gp 41 is an important mediator of viral entry into host cells. Previous studies showed that the virucidal protein cyanovirin-N (CV-N) bound to both gp 120 and gp 41, and that this binding was associated with its antiviral activity. We constructed an HTS assay based on the interaction of europium-labeled CV-N with recombinant glycosylated gp 41 ectodomain to support identification of small-molecule mimetics of CV-N that might be developed as antiviral drug leads. Primary screening of over 107, 000 natural product extracts in the assay yielded 347 confirmed hits. Secondary assays eliminated extracts that bound directly to labeled CV-N or for which the simple sugars mannose and N-acetylglucosamine blocked the interaction with gp 41 (lectin activity).

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} interoperation of heterogeneous bioinformatics databases. Results We introduce BioWarehouse, an open source toolkit for constructing bioinformatics database warehouses using the MySQL and Oracle relational database managers. BioWarehouse integrates its component databases into a common representational framework within a single database management system, thus enabling multi-database queries using the Structured Query Language (SQL) but also facilitating a variety of database integration tasks such as comparative analysis and data mining. BioWarehouse currently supports the integration of a pathway-centric set of databases including ENZYME, KEGG, and BioCyc, and in addition the UniProt, GenBank, NCBI Taxonomy, and CMR databases, and the Gene Ontology. Loader tools, written in the C and JAVA languages, parse and load these databases into a relational database schema. The loaders also apply a degree of semantic normalization to their respective source data, decreasing semantic heterogeneity. The schema supports the following bioinformatics datatypes: chemical compounds, biochemical reactions, metabolic pathways, proteins, genes, nucleic acid sequences, features on protein and nucleic-acid sequences, <b>organisms,</b> <b>organism</b> <b>taxonomies,</b> and controlled vocabularies. As an application example, we applied BioWarehouse to determine the fraction of biochemically characterized enzyme activities for which no sequences exist in the public sequence databases. The answer is that no sequence exists for 36 % of enzyme activities for which EC numbers have been assigned. These gaps in sequence data significantly limit the accuracy of genome annotation and metabolic pathway prediction, and are a barrier for metabolic engineering. Complex queries of this type provide examples {{of the value of}} the data warehousing approach to bioinformatics research.

40|$|Abstract. Biodiversity {{management}} {{requires the}} usage of heterogeneous biological information from multiple sources. Indexing, aggregating, and finding such information is based on names and taxonomic knowledge of <b>organisms.</b> However, <b>taxonomies</b> change in time due to new scientific findings, opinions of authorities, and changes in our conception about life forms. Furthermore, organism names and their meaning change in time, different authorities use different scientific names for the same taxon in different times, and various vernacular names are in use in different languages. This makes data integration and information retrieval difficult without detailed biological information. This paper introduces a meta-ontology for managing the names and <b>taxonomies</b> of <b>organisms,</b> and presents three applications for it: 1) publishing biological species lists as ontology services (ca. 20 taxonomies including more than 80, 000 names), 2) collaborative management of the vernacular names of vascular plants (ca. 26, 000 taxa), and 3) management of individual scientific name changes based on research results, covering a group of beetles.

40|$|Background: The task of gene {{normalization}} is {{to assign}} a unique identifier from a database to the gene mentions. Using these identifiers {{a great deal}} of information can be gathered from external databases such as interactions, pathways, sequences and protein structures. Normalizing gene mentions in articles is a difficult task as the inter-species ambiguity of the gene mentions in biomedical publications is high. The experiences gained from the BioCreative II Gene Normalization Task indicate that the biggest challenge in gene normalization is the recognition of the species that a specific gene mention belongs to. In biomedical scientific articles the authors often use taxonomical entities besides concrete species mentions as references to different group of <b>organisms.</b> Species <b>taxonomies</b> are hierarchical systems (trees) of living creatures and therefore provide a classification of species. Here we investigate the added value of the utilization of taxonomic entity mentions in the inter-species gene normalization task. Results: We present a method which marks those words mentioning all taxonomic entities (genus, family, etc.) and applies filtering heuristics to select the taxonomic entities referring to species mentioned in the document. These entities are then treated as species mentions together with standard species annotations and we employ them in gene normalization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background GenBank(R) is {{a public}} {{repository}} of all publicly available molecular sequence data {{from a range of}} sources. In addition to relevant metadata (e. g., sequence description, source <b>organism</b> and <b>taxonomy),</b> publication information is recorded in the GenBank data file. The identification of literature associated with a given molecular sequence may be an essential first step in developing research hypotheses. Although many of the publications associated with GenBank records may not be linked into or part of complementary literature databases (e. g., PubMed), GenBank records associated with literature indexed in Medline are identifiable as they contain PubMed identifiers (PMIDs). Results Here we show that an analysis of 87, 116, 501 GenBank sequence files reveals that 42 % are associated with a publication or patent. Of these, 71 % are associated with PMIDs, and can therefore be linked to a citation record in the PubMed database. The remaining (29 %) of publication-associated GenBank entries either do not have PMIDs or cite a publication that is not currently indexed by PubMed. We also identify the journal titles that are linked through citations in the GenBank files to the largest number of sequences. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that GenBank contains molecular sequences from a range of disciplines beyond biomedicine, the initial scope of PubMed. The findings thus suggest opportunities to develop mechanisms for integrating biological knowledge beyond the biomedical field. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{functions}} of museums is the deployment of knowledge through collected artifacts. In the case of natural history museums, these collections consist largely of preserved specimens that all share the marks of the human hand {{as a result of}} the processes of preservation and display. Such processes result in the transformation of nature into objects of material culture. Given the challenges that arise from shifting definitions of the natural history specimen in an age when life is being re-defined and re-configured, and living matter is treated as a mutable and expressive substance, I question how our perception of the “order of life” has been impacted by recent developments in genetic manipulation, tissue engineering, and DNA taxonomy. I extend the discussion of the impact of the human hand on natural objects to include the practices of contemporary artists who employ taxidermy, wet preservation, field research, scientific illustration, and biotechnology to investigate the shifting relationship between living <b>organisms</b> and <b>taxonomy.</b> I focus on the hierarchical nature of knowledge in art and science, the changing use of language in classification, systems of preservation and display, and mutations and hybrid organisms, to suggest that natural history as a discipline, can be viewed as a mediating factor between the museum, on the one hand, and both scientific and art practices on the other. The specimen therefore functions as a site of knowledge production that merges both the museological impulses of preservation and conservation with the scientific/laboratory-based impulses of experimentation and alteration...|$|R

Importantly, while all 15 candidate species were morphologically diagnosable a posteriori from one another, single-gene DNA barcoding proved largely unsuccessful as an a priori method for species identification. These results lead us to draw two strong inferences of relevance to {{estimates of}} global biodiversity. First, hyper-cryptic complexes are likely to be common in many organismal groups. Second, no assessment of species numbers can be considered “best practice” in the molecular age unless it explicitly includes estimates of the extent of cryptic and hyper-cryptic biodiversity.

40|$|The title Cities Made, Unmade, Remade {{stems from}} {{an attempt to}} {{classify}} cities irrespective of their geography or history but {{in relation to their}} own life cycle. Beyond the common vision of cities as living <b>organisms</b> this <b>taxonomy</b> instead prefers to think of the city as an object in perpetual construction while it is alive, and as an artefact which unlike most living organisms can be brought back to life after destruction. Nobody has quantified yet how much destruction is needed for a city to die. Consequently, irrespective of place and time, cities are founded; cities boom, cities collapse and almost all cities can be revamped. In this light, The City as a Construction Site proposes a way to look on cities. Even if all this processes can happen at once, we can classify cities as: New cities, or cities in the making; Developing cities, or cities transforming, unmaking themselves; and finally as Historic Cities, cities that have to adapt to a new time, that need to remake themselves. In this particular time, it was my aim to identify territories where each of these processes can apply best, as test grounds to understand what may have happened earlier and may happen ahead. Due to personal but also to a certain extent objective reasons I found at hand to select as areas of study three territories that I know well: the American City, urban India and the city of Berlin.

40|$|Taxonomic classifications {{simultaneously}} represent hypotheses of taxon {{identity and}} relationships to taxonomists, and real, unchanging entities to users of taxonomic information. Taxonomic changes, while representing scientific progress, {{can be a}} source of frustration for users. A method for assessing confidence in the taxonomy of a group of organisms would assist users of the taxonomy. A method is presented for determining the degree of development of a taxonomy, a concept termed ‘taxonomic resolution’. The method was applied to six groups of southern African mygalomorph trapdoor spiders, namely Stasimopus Simon 1892 (Ctenizidae Thorell 1877), Ancylotrypa Simon 1889 (Cyrtaucheniidae Simon 1889), four genera of Idiopidae Simon 1889 assessed as a single group, Galeosoma Purcell 1903, the families Migidae Simon 1889 and Microstigmatidae Roewer 1942, and the burrowing scorpion genus Opistophthalmus C. L. Koch 1837 (Scorpionidae Latreille 1802). The method was {{based on the assumption that}} species delimitation in a group of <b>organisms,</b> the <b>taxonomy</b> of which is based on morphological characters, depends on whether the sample of material examined is adequate for assessing variation in those characters. Five assessment criteria were identified and scored for a group of species using the taxonomic literature. Estimates of the number of species remaining to be discovered and described in each group were also included in the assessment. The results obtained for the trapdoor spiders ranged from 15 to 29 %, indicating a potentially significant degree of uncertainty in the taxonomy. Results for Migidae and Microstigmatidae were 51 and 78 % respectively, whereas the result for Opistophthalmus was 93 %.

40|$|Many prokaryotic organisms {{have adapted}} to {{incredibly}} extreme habitats. The genomes of such extremophiles differ from their non-extremophile relatives. For example, some proteins in thermophiles sustain high temperatures by being more compact than homologs in non-extremophiles. Conversely, some proteins have increased volumes to compensate for freezing effects in psychrophiles that survive in the cold. Here, we revealed that some differences in organisms surviving in extreme habitats correlate with a simple single feature, namely the fraction of proteins predicted to have long disordered regions. We predicted disorder with different methods for 46 completely sequenced organisms from diverse habitats and found a correlation between protein disorder and the extremity of the environment. More specifically, the overall percentage of proteins with long disordered regions {{tended to be more}} similar between organisms of similar habitats than between <b>organisms</b> of similar <b>taxonomy.</b> For example, predictions tended to detect substantially more proteins with long disordered regions in prokaryotic halophiles (survive high salt) than in their taxonomic neighbors. Another peculiar environment is that of high radiation survived, e. g. by Deinococcus radiodurans.

To compile this information a thorough list of all aquatic organisms in Illinois was required.

Each species name was used to search a database which contained toxicity information on aquatic organisms. No toxicological Information was found for many Illinois species. For most organisms, all available information retrieved from the database is presented. For species on which extensive toxicological research has been performed, data showing 96 hour LC 50 or EC 50 values and chronic testing values constitute {{the bulk of the}} records. In addition to records detailing toxicity values and experimental conditions, a list of tested chemical compounds and organisms is included. Literature citing observations and identification of aquatic organisms within Illinois was the most valuable resource in compiling a list of Illinois aquatic species. Staff of the Illinois Natural History Survey were helpful in recommending the most useful publications, making available their own field lists, and helping to update taxonomy and nomenclature from older reports. In particular we would like to acknowledge Don Webb, Larry Page, Warren Brigham, Mark Wetzel, Kevin Cummings, and Allison Brigham from the INHS Faunistics section and Michael Henebry from the section of Aquatic Biology. To retrieve toxicity data on the aquatic organisms of Illinois, a Chemical Information System, Inc. database, AQUIRE (Aquatic Information Retrieval System), was employed. AQUIRE contains data extracted from publications dealing with the toxic effects of chemical substances on aquatic organisms. Each Latin species name from the compiled Illinois list was used to search records in the database. If AQUIRE matched a record with the species name, the record was stored. If there were an excessive number of matching records, the search was narrowed by specifying particular regimens and/or effective endpoint types. Ultimately a printout of the records pertaining to each organism was produced.

The identification of marine natural products contributes to many scientific areas including pharmacology, chemical ecology, chemical synthesis, and others. Today various methodologies {{are used to}} select marine organisms that potentially contain bioactive metabolites.

The first strategy is the High Throughput Screening (HTS) of Irish marine organismsâ extracts against a cancer related target. With that purpose a library of 916 marine organismsâ extracts was composed, a colorectal cancer cell line resistant towards 5 -fluorouracil was prepared and the HTS of the library was conducted on this target. Through this strategy, only one known structure was elucidated among the âhitsâ. Therefore, another methodology directed towards {{the construction of a}} marine chemical library was employed which was based on a selection of marine <b>organisms</b> using their <b>taxonomy.</b> The chemical investigation of species of the genus Haliclona yielded two new and six known compounds. Next, the taxonomy based selection was improved by addition of HPLC-DAD-ELSD chemical screening. The chemical screening of 27 sponges belonging to the order Haplosclerida from the Caribbean and Poecilosclerida order from Ireland, led to the selection of two sponges: Clathria strepsitoxa and Siphonodictyon coralliphagum. In total of 12 new compounds were isolated including interesting sesquiterpene (hydro) quinones together with four known compounds. In total, eight marine organisms were chemically investigated which led to the characterization of 14 new metabolites and 11 known.

An introduction with a brief overview of the actual coccolithophore knowledge and an abridged glossary with figures of the basic terminology are included. This research was supported by the C. S. I. C. and projects MAR 91 - 0359, GRQ 93 - 8041, AMB 94 - 0853; MAS 2 -CT 93 - 0063, MAS 3 -CT 96 - 0051 and MAR 98 - 0932. Samples were provided by, projects MAS 2 -CT 930063, MAS 3 -CT 95 - 0037, MAS 3 -CT 95 - 0016 and programe MEC-HF 98 - 207.

40|$|With {{increasing}} anthropogenic {{threats to}} the marine environment, {{it has become a}} priority to improve our understanding and conservation of marine fauna. In Antarctic waters, a rich and diverse benthic fauna thrives. However, the relative isolation of these organisms and their adaptation to the unique Antarctic environment potentially heightens their vulnerability to environmental change. Thorough research on the genetic and ecological structure of Antarctic benthic invertebrate populations is lacking, particularly for some of the most dominant taxa, such as the Amphipoda. This study investigated genetic structure, diversity and population ecology in some common Antarctic benthic amphipod species, to build a more rigorous understanding of the Antarctic benthos that will aid in future management planning. Genetic structure was explored over a circum-Antarctic scale in the widespread amphipod species Eusirus perdentatus and Eusirus giganteus from the continental shelf, using DNA sequences of two mitochondrial regions (COI and CytB) and one nuclear region (ITS 2). Phylogenies and haplotype networks provided strong evidence that E. perdentatus harbours two previously undetected cryptic species, and E. giganteus harbours at least three, highlighting our current misunderstanding of Antarctic benthic diversity. There were clear differences in the distribution, genetic diversity and connectivity of populations within each cryptic species, and it is proposed that this reflects different modes of post-glacial recolonisation of the continental shelf. Within one cryptic species, high genetic population differentiation (FST > 0. 47, p 6000 individuals, spatial and temporal patterns in abundance, and corresponding relationships with environmental data. The life history of O. franklini revealed several traits that exemplify adaptation to the polar environment, including delayed reproduction, longevity (> 2 years), and seasonal breeding linked to the summer phytoplankton bloom. There was preliminary evidence of inter-annual and spatial fluctuations in reproductive timing, potentially reflecting local sea-ice conditions. O. franklini was found to reach astounding densities (> 65, 000 /m 2) and abundance was highly heterogeneous in space and time. The distribution of O. franklini was related to various sediment properties although the relationship differed with geographic region, highlighting a close association to the local environment as well as broader Antarctic conditions. This study has provided significant insight into the dynamics of Antarctic benthic amphipod populations over a range of scales. Together the results emphasise a considerable degree of heterogeneity largely overlooked in Antarctic benthic <b>organisms</b> (from the <b>taxonomy</b> of entire species down to local-scale intraspecific population dynamics), and thereby support predictions of their vulnerability to anthropogenicinduced change. Results also shed light on speciation processes in Antarctic waters, and will ultimately help inform future planning decisions regarding spatial management of the Antarctic benthic ecosystem...|$|R
