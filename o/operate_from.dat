5|$|The {{first three}} Sea Harriers were a {{development}} batch and {{were used for}} clearance trials. The first production aircraft was delivered to RNAS Yeovilton in 1979 to form an Intensive Flying Trials Unit (also known as 700A Naval Air Squadron). In March 1980 the Intensive Flying Trials Unit became 899 Naval Air Squadron and would act as the landborne headquarters unit for the type. The first operational squadron 800 Naval Air Squadron was also formed in March 1980 initially to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> HMS Invincible before it transferred to HMS Hermes. In January 1981, a second operation squadron 801 Naval Air Squadron was formed to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> HMS Invincible.|$|E

5|$|This {{was about}} to get worse, when France and the Low Countries fell in May to June 1940. U-boats could <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> French Atlantic ports, {{reducing}} their need to make the dangerous journey from ports in Norway or Germany around Scotland, and increasing their operational range in the ocean by several hundred miles. The Luftwaffe with its small, but valuable fleet of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors, could now <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> the same area. From June 1940 onwards, the Battle of the Atlantic began in earnest.|$|E

5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|Keller's IV. Fliegerkorps {{headquarters}} would <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> Düsseldorf, LG 1. Kampfgeschwader 30 {{which was}} based at Oldenburg and its III. Gruppe were based at Marx.

5|$|The Australian Sea Kings {{had similar}} {{avionics}} {{to that of}} the Sea King HAS.1, with the same ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal radome, but had American Bendix AN/ASQ-13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings. They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance. Australia's Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS Melbourne until the carrier was retired from service, without replacement. As the Sea King was too large to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> the s, 817 Squadron was then forced to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> land bases, in both ASW and utility roles, with the Sea King relinquishing the anti-submarine mission in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E
5|$|Although Carnival Cruise Lines did not <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> Mobile {{after the}} Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the Carnival Triumph was towed into the port {{following}} a crippling engine room fire. It {{was the largest}} cruise ship ever to dock at the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the Carnival Conquest, which docked in Mobile when the Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.|$|E

5|$|At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris, Nungesser and Coli, {{working closely}} with Chief Engineer Émile Farret and {{production}} manager Albert Longelot, assisted {{in the design of}} the new Levasseur PL.8 biplane. Based on the Levasseur PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was a conventional, single-bay, wood and fabric-covered biplane that carried a crew of two in a side-by-side, open cockpit.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} carriers were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four carriers meant that five squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided to cancel the two new carriers, which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would <b>operate</b> <b>from</b> the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E
