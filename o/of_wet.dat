40|$|A {{number of}} studies of the {{properties}} of cellulose and of the cellulose-water system {{have been made in}} this laboratory. The general aim of this investigation was to obtain further information by means <b>of</b> heats <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> measurements. Several different studies were made and for purposes of clarity are presented in separate sections. A new technique for the determination of the heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> bone dry cellulose was developed; using this method the value for the heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> standard cotton was measured. A study of the hysteresis effect observed in water sorption was made by measuring the heats <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> cellulose containing various amounts of water, left both as the result of adsorption from the dry state, and as the result of desorption from saturated conditions. Measurements were made of the heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> sulphite pulp at different temperatures between 9 ° and 30 ºC. Further measurements were made in the same temperature range using pulp containing a small amount of adsorbed water. The heats <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> standard cellulose that had been subjected to severe mechanical treatment were determined. The treatment included compressing, pounding and shredding. The heats <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> a number of different pulp sample B were measured...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Surface tension <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> in {{products}} obtained from sampling of IZ type flotation machines by film flotation method has been investigated. The obtained results allowed {{to calculate the}} equations of regressions which characterize the dependence of surface tension <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> particles on the ash content of different rank of coal with the comparatively high correlation coefficient. The equations describing this dependence and research results let us carry out considerations {{about the relationship between}} surface properties of particles (surface tension <b>of</b> <b>wetting)</b> and the ash content in the particles. The outcomes of surface tension <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> calculations <b>of</b> given particles fractions and their ash content showed independently that there exists certain dependency. When the ash content of particles rises, the surface tension <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> is also higher. This dependence may be used for analysis of work of flotation machines.

40|$|The heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> {{regenerated}} cellulosic fibres (TENCEL (R), Viscose and Modal) {{was investigated}} by reaction calorimetry {{in comparison with}} cotton, polyester and TENCEL (R) Fabric. Reaction calorimetry is a technique applied for measuring the heat evolved in chemical reactions where very high analytical precision is required Before the measurements, the fibre samples were dried in an oven at 80 degrees C for 60 min with a low and constant nitrogen flow to eliminate initial moisture. As final results the amount of heat in Joules per gram fibre is given. The experimental {{results showed that the}} highest heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> was measured for man-made cellulosic fibres, middle for cotton, while the lowest heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> was observed for polyester fibres. The heat <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> depends on the interaction of water with hydroxyl groups in the non-crystalline domains of the fibre.

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations <b>of</b> <b>wet,</b> spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E

5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or sitting on top <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and house mouse (Mus musculus), as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground {{and would not be}} expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1879 {{under the}} {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons.

Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during 1885–89.

5|$|Fender's form {{dipped in}} 1924 {{after a good}} start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite {{occasional}} successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey {{finished third in the}} Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. Fender was married {{at the end of the}} 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.|$|E
