40|$|Many early anthropological studies treated {{pastoralist}} populations as egalitarian, however {{there is}} considerable variation in the resources available to individual households. This thesis considers how resources influence the subsistence system of the pastoral Datoga of Lake Eyasi. The two categories of resources considered are wealth and labour. The labour available to Datoga households does not influence the herding strategies of those households. In turn, the herding strategies do not affect the dynamics of cattle herds. This is because households that are short of labour can arrange for their animals to be herded by members of different households, {{and there are no}} discernible costs associated with this. Wealth, defined by livestock holdings, can be measured either as total household wealth, or as wealth per capita. These are conceptually distinct. Among the Datoga, households that are wealthy in terms of total livestock holdings, are also wealthy in terms of wealth per capita, but not proportionally more so. Once households have about five livestock units per capita, any increase in household wealth is used to attract new people to the household, rather than to increase the wealth of existing household members. For many aspects of the production system overall household wealth and wealth per capita have a similar effect, but this is not always the case. In some instances overall household wealth can explain variation between households, whereas wealth per capita cannot. This occurs when the absolute number of animals belonging to a household is important. In terms of provisioning the household and household economics, per capita wealth explains more of the variation between households. Overall the Datoga are struggling to survive. They have been alienated from more fertile areas, and consequently they are poor, and herd productivity is low. This is due to the low reproduction rate of cattle, and the high commercial <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> of both cattle and small stock. The high commercial <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> is driven by subsistence needs and most income is used to buy grain and veterinary products. However, {{there is considerable}} variation between households, and compared to poor households, wealthy households have a comparatively low <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> of livestock, in terms of both mortality and sales. Consequently, they are managing to retain their livestock holdings, or in a few cases to increase the size of their herds. However, wealthy households are in the minority, and the majority of households are caught in a declining cycle of poverty, and will eventually be forced {{to drop out of the}} pastoral system. </p...|$|E
30|$|Deciding which {{animal to}} sell is {{dependent}} on herd size, species composition, age and sex structure and how much cash is needed. Small cash needs are often met by selling small ruminants while cattle are sold when larger sums are required, e.g. to replenish grain stock, for weddings or other important festivities (Sutter 1987). Households tend to preferentially sell non-productive elements of their herds. Market records in northern Nigeria/sub-humid zone indicated that 70 to 88 % of all sales were older males (Fricke 1979; Amanor 1995). Older females {{at the end of}} their breeding life also usually account for a significant proportion of sales and/or slaughters, often occurring in more local markets; thus, the 28.2 % share of farm gate sales recorded in this study (Table  11) is not untypical nor is the sale of young males (30.2 % of sales). More young males than mature males were sold, perhaps reflecting grazing constraints. However, the high <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> of heifers is very unusual (18.6 % of all sales), as this compromises the future growth of the herd (Abaelu 1973; Pullan and Grindle 1980; Sieff 1995).|$|E
40|$|Wild {{animals are}} {{a primary source}} of protein (bushmeat) for people living in or near {{tropical}} forests. Ideally, the effect of bushmeat harvests should be monitored closely by making regular estimates of <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> and size of stock available for exploitation. However, in practice, this is possible in very few situations because it requires both of these aspects to be readily measurable, {{and even in the}} best case, entails very considerable time and effort. As alternative, in this study, we use high-resolution, environmental favorability models for terrestrial mammals (N = 165) in Central Africa to map areas of high species richness (hot spots) and hunting susceptibility. Favorability models distinguish localities with environmental conditions that favor the species ’ existence from those with detrimental characteristics for its presence. We develop an index for assessing Potential Hunting Sustainability (PHS) of each species based on their ecological characteristics (population density, habitat breadth, rarity and vulnerability), weighted according to restrictive and permissive assumptions of how species ’ characteristics are combined. Species are classified into five main hunting sustainability classes using fuzzy logic. Using the accumulated favorability values of all species, and their PHS values, we finally identify weak spots, defined as high diversity regions of especial hunting vulnerability for wildlife, as well as strong spots, defined as high diversity areas of high hunting sustainability potential. Our study uses relatively simple models that employ easily obtainable data of a species ’ ecological characteristics to assess the impacts of hunting in tropical regions.

40|$|A model {{describing}} livestock grazing {{system dynamics}} {{was developed and}} fitted to available data. This study preliminarily explored {{the use of a}} formal management procedure (MP) approach to determine appropriate annual offtake in a terrestrial system. This approach has been applied in marine systems with great success, but has never been tried in terrestrial ecosystems. Rangelands and marine systems have in common {{the fact that there is}} often an offtake component to them and so stakeholders in those systems need knowledge of optimal harvesting strategies within defined management strategies. Three models were developed that described the growth of female goats in Paulshoek. The first (basic livestock model) depicted the growth of livestock as a logistic equation with an adult survival term and an annual growth term. The second model (rainfall-livestock model) added a rainfall component, with livestock productivity modelled as a function of rainfall. The final version of the model (vegetation-rainfall-livestock model) added a vegetation component that interacted with rainfall and livestock. The rainfall-livestock model provided a statistically significant better fit to the data, followed by the vegetation-rainfall model. The vegetation-rainfall-livestock model provided a reasonable representation of livestock population changes through time, with the largest deviations evident over the period 1975 - 1980. Results show that environmental factors alone are unable to fully explain observed system dynamics because anthropogenic factors for which no data are available may also play a role. Preliminary exploration with a simple MP suggested that a low <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> of 10 % provided the highest average annual offtake. Our study has shown that a rangeland stocking system can be reasonably described by a simple model that uses only rainfall data and a rainfall-vegetation-livestock interaction. Rangeland livestock systems would benefit greatly from adopting an MP approach as it would allow stakeholders to make informed decisions on stocking rates and annual offtake...|$|E
40|$|Management zones feature {{prominently}} in conservation planning, particularly at large spatial scales, but prioritization of {{areas of concern}} is required to focus efforts and limited resources. Human-mediated mortality constitutes {{a major threat to}} species persistence, particularly for widespread carnivores that undergo harvest and population control, such as the leopard (Panthera pardus). In this study, we evaluated the extent and spatial distribution of legal anthropogenic offtake of leopards to identify de facto refugia and ecological traps across Limpopo Province, South Africa. We defined refugia as management units with offtake levels below an established sustainable harvest rate, and ecological traps as management units with offtake exceeding the sustainable harvest rate. We assessed offtake at three geographical scales using trophy hunting permit records alone, and then in combination with problem leopard permit records to investigate the compounding effect of additional forms of offtake and the potential for management scale mismatching. Across Limpopo Province, high leopard offtake created fewer areas of refuge than ecological traps. Refugia were smaller in size and within close proximity of ecological traps. Human-mediated leopard mortality occurred mostly in prime leopard habitat. Finerscaled management units resulted in fewer ecological traps and more refugia, and enables authorities to focus conservation attention in areas of concern. Human-mediated leopard mortality exceeded the annual <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> considered sustainable. Our study highlights the importance of assessing both the scale and distribution of the harvest, whilst also considering alternative forms of offtake, when devising harvest management strategies. Management scale mismatching and high human-mediated leopard mortality is of particular concern in Limpopo Province, as such, we propose an adaptive, science-based regulatory framework aimed at improving leopard harvest strategies.

40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR) is {{an acute}} infectious viral disease affecting domestic small ruminants (sheep and goats) and some wild ruminant species in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. A global PPR control strategy based on mass vaccination-in regions where PPR is endemic-was recently designed and launched by international organizations. Sahelian Africa {{is one of}} the most challenging endemic regions for PPR control. Indeed, strong seasonal and annual variations in mating, mortality and offtake rates result in a complex population dynamics which might in turn alter the population post-vaccination immunity rate (PIR), and thus be important to consider for the implementation of vaccination campaigns. In a context of preventive vaccination in epidemiological units without PPR virus transmission, we developed a predictive, dynamic model based on a seasonal matrix population model to simulate PIR dynamics. This model was mostly calibrated with demographic and epidemiological parameters estimated from a long-term follow-up survey of small ruminant herds. We used it to simulate the PIR dynamics following a single PPR vaccination campaign in a Sahelian sheep population, and to assess the effects of (i) changes in <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> related to the Tabaski (a Muslim feast following the lunar calendar), and (ii) the date of implementation of the vaccination campaigns. The persistence of PIR was not influenced by the Tabaski date. Decreasing the vaccination coverage from 100 to 80 % had limited effects on PIR. However, lower vaccination coverage did not provide sufficient immunity rates (PIR < 70 %). As a trade-off between model predictions and other considerations like animal physiological status, and suitability for livestock farmers, we would suggest to implement vaccination campaigns in September-October. This model is a first step towards better decision support for animal health authorities. It might be adapted to other species, livestock farming systems or diseases...|$|E

The efficiency of these practiceInternational audienceOn the Bolivian arid highlands, breeders' strategies combining herd diversification (llamas and sheep) {{and the control}} of breeding rate were assessed under unpredictable environmental conditions. A survey of 14 farms made it possible to characterise practices in llama flocks (controlled and uncontrolled breeding practices) and in sheep flocks (high care and low care practices). The efficiency of these practices was evaluated using annual numerical productivity indexes. To assess the effectiveness of these practices, a dynamic model of mixed herds, based on the mathematical framework of the viability theory, was developed. The model made it possible to analyse the long-term interactions between management practices and climatic uncertainty on livestock system sustainability. Numerical productivity at weaning was found to be significantly lower in llama flocks managed with controlled breeding compared to uncontrolled breeding (44 % and 70 % respectively). For sheep, numerical productivity at weaning of high-care flocks was not significantly higher than that of low-care ones (83 % and 69 %, respectively). It was not possible to conclude whether high-care practices were more efficient in increasing numbers than low-care ones. On a long-term perspective, the dynamic analysis showed that the control of the llama flock breeding rate stabilises the evolution of the mixed herd only when a low <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> can satisfy a minimum income. Thus, foregoing short-term yield can be a sound strategy to insure mixed herd viability in an extremely harsh and unpredictable environment. However, the effectiveness of this practice is closely related to wealth (herd size). The model is discussed in terms of its heuristic value for assessing management practices and sustainability of pastoral systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of feral cats (Felis catus) were assessed at Shark Bay at two adjoining sites subject to differing intensities of predator control. The Heirisson Prong conservation reserve (12 km 2) was fenced to exclude predators and {{was subject to}} intensive control actions, while {{a portion of the}} adjoining Carrarang pastoral lease (60 km 2) was subject to a lesser level of control. Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were largely absent at both sites owing to effective control. Densities of cats were highly variable over time, showing strong annual fluctuations over 14 years of records Three independent estimates of peak density were made, varying between 1. 5 and 2. 8 km 2. Rate of increase was assessed as 0. 98 on the pastoral lease and 0. 99 on the conservation reserve (to give an approximate doubling of the population every 8. 5 months). A logistic model, with K = 1. 5 km- 2 and r of 0. 98, gave a maximum sustained yield of 0. 37 cats km- 2 year- 1 and a harvest rate of > 0. 6 cats km- 2 year- 1 for their elimination in 5 years or less (for K = 2. 8 km- 2, these values increase to 0. 69 and > 1. 05 km- 2 year- 1 respectively). Harvest outcomes at both sites were consistent with these models. However, the effort required to maintain a given <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> increased 6 -fold at low cat densities and offtake by trapping as a function of cat density took the form of a Type 3 functional response. The functional response for cat trapping (the offtake with constant effort per unit time) overlaid against the curve of cat productivity suggested a stable equilibrium point at low cat densities (0. 07 - 0. 13 cats km- 2). Hence, trapping effort needed to be greatly intensified at low cat densities and/or augmented by other methods of control to eradicate cats from the closed system of the reserve. The strongly male-biased sex ratio of captures at the barrier fence suggested high levels of reinvasion from beyond the harvested area of the pastoral lease and this made effective control in this open system difficult...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{traditional}} sheep production was undertaken from February, 1998 to January, 1999 in Lallo-Mama Mider woreda, Northern Shewa, Ethiopia. For this study 90 flocks of the Menz sheep from three peasant associations were included. Data {{were collected on}} management practices, composition of livestock mix, ownership patterns, flock demography, and production constraints {{that need to be}} tackled in the area. For the study of reproduction and growth performance, mortality and offtake rates, 36 flocks were further selected and monitored year round. In this woreda, sheep were kept at marginal situations as far as housing, lamb rearing, feeding and feed management and disease control practices were concerned. Sheep constituted 80 % of the total livestock mix. The mean numbers of sheep in small, medium and large flocks were 11. 7, 26. 8 and 34. 1 heads respectively. Over 51. 68 % of small flocks were owned by two persons. Of the total sheep considered 67. 4 % were females, 28. 1 % males and 4. 6 % castrates. Age at first lambing ranged from 15 - 22 months. Lambing interval (n= 485) was 286 Â± 13 days. Annual reproduction rate (n= 297) was 1. 36 Â± 0. 02 lambs per ewe per year. Individual flock and season sigltificantly influenced both lambing interval and annual reproduction rate. Average litter size (n= 392) was 1. 03 Â± 0. 01 lambs per ewe per lambing and only season significantly affected litter size. Lambing occurred through out the year with peaks during the big rain and dry season. Lambs weighed on the average 1. 76 kg at birth, 3. 87, 6. 02, 7. 74, 9. 03, 10. 13 and 11. 06 kg at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days of age respectively. Weight gain from birth to 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days of age ranged from 51. 45 to 70. 57 grams per day. Except birth weight, both mean weight and weight gain were significantly affected by season, sex, parity, postpartum weight and individual flock. The mean body weight of sheep that had 1 to 4 pairs of permanent incisors ranged from 16. 98 to 20. 96 kg and annual weight gain was less than 0. 05 grams per day. The sex, season and individual flock effects were significant in all age groups. Mean flock mortality rate was 16. 84 %. The sex, age group, season and individual flock had significant effect. Pre-weaning mortality rate was 17. 71 % and was influenced by season of birth, parity and individual flock effects. The total <b>offtake</b> <b>rate</b> was 27. 96 % per annum. The ratio of entry to exit was 1 : 1 and the total flock size during the year stayed fairly balanced.

40|$|Variation in {{demographic}} rates {{within a}} spatially structured population could have important consequences for management decisions, harvesting strategies and <b>offtake</b> <b>rates.</b> Although {{there is a}} growing body of evidence suggesting that demographic rates vary within populations over a range of spatial scales, there has been little research investigating the consequences of this variation for population management. In this paper, data on the dynamics of two female red deer sub-populations on Rum are analysed, and evidence is presented for differences between the fecundity and mortality rates of the two sub-populations. A simple harvesting model is developed to represent the dynamics of the two sub-populations, including density-independent migration between sub-populations and spatially correlated environmental variability. The highest monetary yield in the model is obtained by harvesting the more resilient sub-population at a higher rate. Surprisingly the losses involved in harvesting both sub-populations at the same rate are insignificant. However, if migration were density-dependent, the size of one sub-population would be more relevant to harvesting policy for the other sub-population. The results of this empirical study are compared to theoretical work on spatially structured populations; it is shown that when a species has complex age- and sex-structured population dynamics, previous theoretical results may not hold...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{economically}} design an optimum carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) flood for a mature waterflood nearing its economic abandonment. The original project utilized advanced reservoir characterization and CO{sub 2 } horizontal injection wells as the primary methods to redevelop the South Cowden Unit (SCU). The development plans; project implementation and reservoir management techniques were {{to be transferred to}} the public domain to assist in preventing premature abandonment of similar fields. The Unit was a mature waterflood with water cut exceeding 95 %. Oil must be mobilized {{through the use of a}} miscible or near-miscible fluid to recover significant additional reserves. Also, because the unit was relatively small, it did not have the benefit of economies of scale inherent in normal larger scale projects. Thus, new and innovative methods were required to reduce investment and operating costs. Two primary methods used to accomplish improved economics were use of reservoir characterization to restrict the flood to the higher quality rock in the unit and use of horizontal injection wells to cut investment and operating costs. The project consisted of two budget phases. Budget Phase I started in June 1994 and ended late June 1996. In this phase Reservoir Analysis, Characterization Tasks and Advanced Technology Definition Tasks were completed. Completion enabled the project to be designed, evaluated, and an Authority for Expenditure (AFE) for project implementation submitted to working interest owners for approval. Budget Phase II consisted of the implementation and execution of the project in the field. Phase II was completed in July 2001. Performance monitoring, during Phase II, by mid 1998 identified the majority of producing wells which under performed their anticipated withdrawal rates. Newly drilled and re-activated wells had lower <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> than originally forecasted. As a result of poor offtake, higher reservoir pressure was a concern for the project as it limited CO{sub 2 } injectivity. To reduce voidage balance, and reservoir pressure, a disposal well was therefore drilled. Several injection surveys indicated the CO{sub 2 } injection wells had severe conformance issues. After close monitoring of the project to the end of 1999, it was evident the project would not recover the anticipated tertiary reserves. The main reasons for under-performance were poor in zone CO{sub 2 } injection into the upper San Andres layers, poorer <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> from newly drilled replacement wells and a higher than required reservoir pressure. After discussion internally within Phillips, externally with the Department of Energy (DOE) and SCU partners, a redevelopment of South Cowden was agreed upon to commence in year 2000. The redevelopment essentially abandoned the original development for Budget Phase II in favor of a revised approach. This involved conformance techniques to resolve out of zone CO{sub 2 } injection and use of horizontal wells to improve in zone injectivity and productivity. A phased approach was used to ensure short radius lateral drilling could be implemented effectively at South Cowden. This involved monitoring drilling operations and then production response to determine if larger investments during the second phase were justified. Redevelopment Phase 1 was completed in May 2000. It was deemed a success in regard to finding suitable/cost-effective technology for drilling horizontal laterals and finding a technique that could sustain long-term productivity from the upper layers of the San Andres reservoir. Four existing vertical producing wells were isolated from their existing completions and sidetracked with horizontal laterals into the upper layers of the San Andres. Overall average <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> for the four wells increased by a factor of 12 during the first four months after completion of Phase 1. Phase 2 of the redevelopment focused on current CO{sub 2 } vertical injection wells. Techniques were applied to resolve near well conformance concerns and then either single or dual laterals were drilled in the upper layers. Additional work required conformance resolution with a horizontal injection well and additional lateral drilling from four existing producing wells. Although Phase 1 had provided a short-term boost to lease offtake, it was Phase 2, by ensuring in zone CO{sub 2 } injection in all existing vertical wells, which would provide the longer-term reserve recovery from the upper San Andres. Phase 2 activities commenced in October 2000 with drilling a single lateral in an existing CO{sub 2 } injector. Four dual lateral and one single lateral CO{sub 2 } injection wells were completed from existing wellbores to replace the poorly performing CO{sub 2 } vertical injection wells. Four additional single laterals from existing vertical production wells were also completed. Phase 2 was completed in April 2001...|$|R

Similarly, pre-slaughter and carcass characteristics data on 1, 724 N'Dama cattle {{collected from the}} national abattoir, Abuko, in 1989 / 90 were analysed.

The asset value of cattle, even for those considered unproductive, increased higher relative to cash savings that would have accrued had the animals been sold prior to the devaluation. Analysis of the carcass data showed high reproductive wastage through slaughtering of pregnant cows in response to dry season feed shortages. This action was considered economically sound as the alternative was death of the stock. It was concluded that the reluctance of traditional stock owners to sell animals may in part stem from economic consideration and that when faced with production constraints such as shortfalls in feed supplies, farmers do sell animals readily. However, stock sold in emaciated conditions as observed {{in this study are}} not likely to meet the requirements of importers or attract good prices at the local markets...|$|R

40|$|Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) hunt various primates, but {{concentrate}} on red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus spp.) wherever {{the two species}} are sympatric. The extraordinarily large Ngogo chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, preys heavily on the local population of red colobus (P. tephrosceles). Census data showed a steep decline in this population {{in the center of}} the chimpanzees’ home range between 1975 and 2007 [Lwanga et al., 2011; Teelen, 2007 b]. Given no obvious change in food availability, predation by chimpanzees was the most likely cause [ibid.; Teelen, 2008]. However, census data from other parts of the home range raised the possibility that the decline was restricted to this central area [Teelen, 2007 a] We present data from 1998 to 2012 on the rate of encounters between chimpanzees and red colobus that provide a chimpanzee‐centered estimate of red colobus density, thus of predation opportunities, throughout the home range. These corroborate census data by showing a long‐term decline in encounters near the center. They also show that encounters become relativelymore common at increasing distances from the center, but encounter rates have decreased even in peripheral areas and, by implication, the red colobus population has declined throughout the study area. These data corroborate Teelen’s [2008] conclusion that chimpanzee predation on red colobus during the 1990 s and early 2000 s was unsustainable. Hunting <b>rates</b> and prey <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> have also declined markedly; whether this will allow the red colobus population to recover is unknown.

40|$|Dual purpose cattle {{production}} in mixed farming systems of Nicaragua is predominantly based on permanent grazing of naturalized grasslands, introduced pastures and crop residues. Milk production and animal <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> are low. Information to guide gender responsive interventions to improve livestock production is being generated through a collaborative project by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), the National Agrarian University of Nicaragua (UNA), and the University of Natural Resources and life Sciences in Austria (BOKU). Gender disaggregated data on milk production of 447 animals on 59 farms from Camoapa in central Nicaragua {{have been collected}} over 8 months. The data shows that more than 40 % of the households keep Brown Swiss crosses, however, male headed households keep significantly more Brahman and Holstein crosses than female headed households. The average daily milk production per animal is also significantly lower in female headed households (3. 54 ± 1. 55 kg) than in male headed households (4. 14 ± 1. 87 kg). Farmers are conversant with Artificial Insemination (AI), however the technology is not widely adopted. Reasons mentioned for low adoption include: high costs of service, need for repeat services, and unavailability of semen from desired breed-types (e. g. Brahman × Brown Swiss). Gender analysis revealed {{that the need for}} repeated services, which increased the costs of AI, is caused by a time mismatch between the animals' heat and the AI provision. These delays are in turn determined by the gender division of labour in livestock management: women are in charge of identifying when animals come into heat but {{have to wait for the}} men to call the AI service providers. Women head of households have difficulty accessing AI services and information altogether as they are less involved in cooperative groups and training on technologies related to {{cattle production}}. This reduces the effectiveness of AI in both male and female headed households. Practical training programs are required on reproductive management and the use of AI designed with gender responsive approaches. Austrian Development Agenc...|$|R
40|$|Présentation de l'éditeur : Ruminant {{livestock}} (cattle, small ruminants, and camels) have a determinant economic role in many tropical developing countries. In traditional {{low-input farming}} systems, demographic parameters (e. g. reproduction or mortality rates) are important indicators for estimating and modelling herd dynamics and production, and impacts of farming practices or environmental risks (droughts, epizootics, etc.). Although such parameters have been extensively {{described in the}} literature on tropical livestock, many descriptions only rely on empirical presentations of formulas without clear methodological justifications. This book fills this gap, presenting the main concepts used to define and compute demographic parameters for tropical livestock, such as probabilities and hazard rates of occurrences and competing risks. It is based on the LASER software, a relational database management system specifically designed for animal-based monitoring surveys. It also provides an introduction on R, the free statistical software ([URL] used for the computations. It is intended for researchers, engineers, technicians, or students dealing with demographic parameters of tropical ruminant livestock in various fields such as animal science, epidemiology, or economy. It will also be valuable for readers wishing to enhance their understanding of definitions and formulas found in the literature, and it will guide them in their applications. Contents: 1.

40|$|Government {{introduced}} {{livestock production}} systems (commercial, company, cooperative, individual, group, and grazing blocks) in Kenya's rangelands began about 15 years ago. This studyanalyizes {{the impact of}} group cooperative and individual ranching systems on resource productivity in South-Central Kenya. The issue of land subdivision {{of the group and}} cooperative ranching systems was also investigated. This was done by dividing the individual ranches into 4 strata (land area groups). The average land areas were 110, 240, 500, and 800 ha for strata 1 - 4 respectively. Survey results were summarized {{for each of the three}} ranching systems and the four individual ranch strata. Summary results included human and livestock populations, livestock breed composition, livestock off takes, and loaned and off-ranch grazing, annual ranch incomes and expenditures, and ranch assets. To measure livestock productivity, net returns per unit of some specified resources (people, land, and livestock) were used; hence budget analysis was adopted as the primary analytical tool for this study. Results from livestock and livestock products indi- iv cated that group ranches had positive net returns, and cooperative and individual ranches had neqative net returns. Extremely high livestock operating expenditures, particularly costs for maintenance and repairs, and high noncommercial <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> (largely due to high livestock mortality and slaughter for home consumption) greatly influenced the neqative net returns. The individual ranches had the lowest economic efficiency and highest physical efficiency, whereas group ranches had the reverse results. Hence, accelerated rangeland degradation would likely impact the individual ranches most because of their high livestock and human stocking rates. Individual ranches also had higher welfare status because they were found to spend more per person for home consumption, their proportion of total income spent for consumption was lower, and they had higher mean years of formal education than the group ranches. To address the cooperative and group ranch land subdivision issue, similar budget analyses were performed for the four individual ranch strata. Results revealed that stratum 4 had all positive net returns while the other three strata had negative net returns. While stratum 4 had the highest economic efficiency and lowest phYSical efficiency, stratum 1 had opposite results. Similarly, stratum 4 had the highest social welfare status and stratum 1 the lowest. Thus, group and cooperative ranch subdivision into smaller individual ranches like those in strata 1 and 2 would be both uneconomical and retrogressive to the rangeland resouces...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the cattle population of the Mnisi community in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The study provided data on the cattle population dynamics over 12 months, from July 2012 through June 2013. It focused on over 4, 500 cattle in Ward B 2 of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) control zone, comprising five diptanks, allowing for data recording on individuals and collecting information from farmers when they came once a week to have their cattle dipped and inspected for FMD. A baseline census was established for all the herds via individual identification by ear-tagging, gathering data such as age, gender, type and body condition. This information was updated weekly over 12 months with demographic parameters - herd dynamics, entries and exits. With an average herd size of 25. 8 cattle, ranging from 1 - 138 animals per herd, farmers in the study area own more livestock than many other communal farmers in other regions of southern Africa. Herd structure differs from that reported in other studies, with breeding cows aged three years and older representing 55. 8 % of the herd and heifers 2 %, resulting in one bull per 2. 1 cows. As for the herd composition, Sanga types and their crosses make up most of the herds in Ward B 2, and their average body condition score was 2. 7 on a 1 - 4 scale. The calving rate of 40. 1 % is a good sign of herd fertility, and represents 86. 3 % of all entries into the study population. The mortality rate of 7. 3 % is low compared to other studies, and represents 76. 8 % of all exits. Due to the restriction on movements of FMD-vaccinated cattle, intake and <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> are low. Cattle herds in Ward B 2 show signs of good health such as good body condition, low mortality rate and good reproductive performance. Over a year, the study population increased by 13. 3 %. Such a project can hopefully be the starting point for further HDSS work in the Mnisi community, which will refine population parameter estimates over the years by continuing weekly information recording.

30|$|In Kenya’s Northeastern Province, {{pastoralism}} is {{the main}} livestock production system and means of livelihood. However, pastoralists are facing increasing risks such as drought, insecurity, animal diseases, increasing human populations and land fragmentation. This study sought to evaluate household livestock herd structures and dynamics in view of such risks and subsistence and market demands. The {{study was conducted in}} Garissa County of Kenya, using a cross-sectional household survey. The data was analysed for descriptive statistics of household livestock status, dynamics and demographic parameters. The results showed that females of reproductive age formed over 50  % of all livestock species. Cattle had the highest turnover and all species’ mortalities accounted for the greater proportion of exits. Cattle had the highest multiplication and growth rates, but also the highest mortality, offtake, commercial <b>offtake</b> and intake <b>rates.</b> Goats had the lowest mortalities, offtake, commercial <b>offtake</b> and intake <b>rates.</b> Overall, the herds were structured to provide for both immediate and future needs in terms of milk, sales and herd replacement as well as for rapid recovery after disasters. The livestock herd dynamics indicate efforts at culling, restocking, retention of valuable categories of animals, and natural events. Livestock populations would be annihilated over time if the trends in end balances and negative growth rates were to continue and not be interrupted by the upward phases of the livestock cycles. It was recommended that the Government and development partners should undertake interventions to balance the herd dynamics in favour of entries by improvement of reproduction and reduction of mortalities, and support livelihood diversification to reduce dependence on livestock.|$|R

40|$|A flock {{monitoring}} {{study on}} 60 households as undertaken from October 2008 to September 2009 to measure productive and reproductive performances; determine socioeconomic benefits and husbandry practices; and identify production barriers and suggest intervention options in Alaba Special Woreda. The Woreda was stratified {{on the basis}} of sheep and goat densities and the respective sites and households were selected using multistage (purposive and random) sampling techniques. Mean land holding per household was 1. 5 ha. On average, a household owned 6. 5 cattle, 6. 1 sheep, 4. 5 goats, 1. 15 equines and 4. 2 chickens. Hot pepper, teff and chat are the major cash sources for farmers. Small ruminant are mainly kept for income generation. Males were sold or slaughtered before attaining puberty. ‘Afelama’, a local bylaw and punishment rule, restricts movement of sheep and goats during cropping period. Sale, death, home slaughter, share holding, gifts out and predator contributed for 60. 5, 13. 8, 11. 0, 5. 2, 1. 4, and 5. 7 % exits, respectively, in sheep flocks while the corresponding values for goats were 41. 5, 17. 8, 16. 1, 5. 9, 11. 9, and 2. 5 %. Sheep and goats are mainly sold to purchase agricultural inputs (fertilizer and improved seeds) and is the major reason for the reported exits. Home born, purchase, shareholding, and gifts back constituted 87. 1 %, 10. 1, 1. 7 and 1. 1 % entries, respectively, for sheep while for goats the values were 94. 4, 2. 1, 2. 8 and 0. 7 %, respectively. Most lambing and kidding occurred between March and June, the apparent peak being in May. Mean birth weight (BWT) (kg), weaning weight (WWT) (kg), Average daily gain to weaning (ADG, g), litter size, age at first parturition and parturition interval (months) for sheep were 2. 30 + 0. 03, 10. 35 + 0. 19, 89. 24 + 1. 98, 1. 52 + 0. 04, 12. 43 + 0. 1, and 9. 19 + 0. 08, respectively. The corresponding values for goats were 2. 34 + 0. 03, 9. 85 + 0. 29, 82. 34 + 3. 18, 1. 47 + 0. 04, 11. 95 + 0. 13, and 9. 05 + 0. 08 respectively. Sex, parity, litter size and season significantly (P< 0. 05) affected BWT in sheep whereas birth type affected 90 day weight, ADG and 120 day weight. Similarly, season influenced 30 and 120 day weights significantly (P< 0. 05). All fixed factors except sex significantly (P< 0. 05) affected BWT in goats whereas birth type and season significantly affected weight at 30, 60, 90 days and ADG consistently while other factors affected weight at specific ages; however, the trends were not consistent. Pre-weaning mortality rate of 13. 89 % and 10. 66 % were found for sheep and goats, respectively. Mean milk yield (morning milk) of does was 150 + 56. 03 ml. <b>Offtake</b> <b>rates</b> of sheep and goats were 41. 18 and 30. 37 %, respectively. Small ruminant enterprise contributes 52. 32 % of the net total cash income obtained from livestock rearing and 24. 23 % of the net total agricultural cash income. The major problems for small ruminant production in the area are poor veterinary services, water and feed shortage, seasonal market fluctuations and lack of overall extension supports. Higher rate of abortions and mortality could offset the higher prolificacy of kid and lamb crops obtained. To utilize the current emerging market opportunities, attempts should be made to improve veterinary services and forage development to alleviate the losses due to co-occurrence of high parturitions during critical feed shortage time. Efforts should also be made to optimize female reproduction and increase lamb and kid output. To select outstanding males from the local genotypes, breeding strategy should be devised. Further study is needed to identify the milking potential of the Does and cost-effective feeding strategy from locally available feeds for finishing animals in the area.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Grazing {{lands in}} Eritrea are {{degraded}} due to decades of overstocking and consequent overgrazing. Since the rangelands are accessible to entire village communities, organisation and coordinated decision making regarding {{the management of}} these resources is not often achieved. Farmers are not motivated enough to make investments to improve a communally owned resource due to the prevailing common access grazing systems. A field survey was undertaken interviewing 12 farmers in the private access commercial and 80 farmers in the common access subsistence grazing using face to face interviews in the Barka and Arado cattle farming communities in four out of the six regions in Eritrea. Debub, Gash-Barka, S. Keih Bahri and Maekel regions were selected using stratified and simple random sampling methods. The regions were chosen based on various agroecological zones where the representatives of different grass species and the two most common cattle breeds in Eritrea (Arado and Barka) are found. The survey included the collection of data on village and household characteristics focusing on rangeland grazing management systems and additional sources of supplementary forage. The study uses several stages of analysis like principal component analysis accompanied by regression analysis together with descriptive statistics and ordination diagram. The commercial farmers addressed grazing constraints by investing in improved grazing through planting 258 ha per farmer of drought resistant seeds and 1767 vs. 8 cactus slices per farmer and covered 75 % vs. 40 % of forage requirements from grazing resources compared to the subsistence farmers, respectively, during 2002. These results were achieved because 78 % of the commercial farmers adopted controlled stocking rates. In common access grazing, the costs of collective action to control cattle stocking rates are high, making imple mentation of stocking rate controls difficult. As a consequence, 65 % of the subsistence farmers were forced to migrate their cattle looking for grazing forage in the dry season during the year. The outcomes of migration were evidenced {{by the results of}} severe overgrazing and degradation on the rangelands proximity to villages in Debub and Maekel regions and the populated area of Gash_Barka region. The increased number of animals resulting in high grazing pressure was the consequence of migration. Ten vs. six percent of mortality rates was reported for the subsistence systems compared to the commercial systems respectively. The lower results of milk yield, calving rates and off- take rate productivity indicated in the different stages of analysis for the subsistence farmers were the consequences of the lack of the adoption of controlled stocking rates primarily constrained by the migration. The Barka and Arado cattle farming systems are kept under common access grazing systems. Compared to the Arado cattle farming, the Barka cattle farming region had relatively better access to grazing forage. The better quality of grazing in this region is attributed to a naturally low stock density in the region. During 2002, the Barka cattle farming had 1087 vs. 721 Lit of milk yield, 63 % vs. 53 % of calving productivity and 9. 3 % vs. 10. 9 % of mortality rates than the Arado cattle farming regions respectively, due to access to a wider area of grazing lands and more labour inputs. The Barka cattle area farmers are agro pastoralists and usually focus on grazing dairy cattle farming than crop farming. They increased calving rate productivity and decreased mortality rates by increasing the proportion of lactating cows and decreasing the proportion of oxen compared to the Arado cattle farming. The Arado cattle farming had higher <b>offtake</b> <b>rates</b> and income from cattle sales compared to the Barka cattle farming region. The higher off- take rate, which is an index of percentage of cattle sold, for the Arado cattle was probably linked to the shortage of grazing forage and increased herding costs. The Barka and Arado cattle farmers had a shortage of quality and quantity crop residue winter forage during 2002. Farmers were dependent only on rain fed cropping. The application of crop rotation, fallow and chemical fertilizers were low to enhance soil nutrients. Out of the total crop residues forage produced, only 22 % and 15 % of legumes residue DM forage was produced for the Barka and Arado cattle farmers respectively. Agro- industrial and crop farming by-products supplementary feeds were also limited due to the shortage of feeds in the country during the year. In general, government intervention is important to bring institutional changes to promote the adoption of controlled stocking rates to alleviate the shortage of grazing forage...|$|R
