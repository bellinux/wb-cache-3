Unlike other boys who idolised footballers, Woodhouse stated his heroes were Nigel Benn and Mike Tyson. He admits to {{fighting}} at school and in the streets after being racially abused: [...] "I went from scrapping in the street and at school to fighting in the boxing ring from the age of 12. I was called a few names due to the colour <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> but with a quick smack in the mouth they soon backed off." [...] He used to visit Boothferry Park to support Hull City before pursuing his career in professional football. He has a wife, Charlotte, and two children: a son named Kyle and a daughter, Isla.|$|E
60|$|And I started {{almost out}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> at the {{unexpected}} London accent. It {{was as if}} one suddenly found oneself in the Tube.|$|E
60|$|The {{assembled}} {{warriors and}} chieftains examined me closely, feeling my muscles and the texture <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin.</b> The principal chieftain then evidently signified {{a desire to}} see me perform, and, motioning me to follow, he started with Tars Tarkas for the open plaza.|$|E

"I {{have thought}} this matter over, Gar'ner, with all <b>my</b> mind--have dreamt <b>of</b> it--slept on it--had it before {{me at all}} hours, and in all weathers; and, {{look at it as}} I will, it is full of difficulties. Will you agree to take in a half-cargo <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skins</b> and iles next season, and make in all respect? a joint v'y'ge of it; from home, home ag'in, if we'll consent to let this craft be burned?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{would be}} different. One would be {{standing}} then for something, either worth or not worth dying for. One could even run away then {{and be done}} with it. But I can’t run away unless I got out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> and left that behind. Don’t you understand? You are very stupid [...] .” But she had the grace to add, “On purpose.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Happy?" [...] {{repeated}} Blanche [...] "Mind! this {{is strictly}} between ourselves. I {{am ready to}} jump out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> for joy. I love him! I love him! I love him!" [...] she cried, with a childish pleasure in repeating the words. They were echoed by a heavy sigh. Blanche instantly looked up into Anne's face. [...] "What's the matter?" [...] she asked, with a sudden change of voice and manner.|$|E
6000|$|I am the hounded slave, I wince at {{the bite}} of the dogs, [...] Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen, [...] I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the [...] ooze <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> [...] I fall on the weeds and stones, [...] The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, [...] Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently {{over the head with}} whip-stocks.|$|E

5000|$|... "He {{turned on}} me. I was devastated. He {{used to call}} me ‘P***’ because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dark <b>skin.</b> <b>My</b> dad's half Spanish. He would shout it at me every day for at least two years. I was about 14 or 15 by the time it had got really bad. He would kick the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> chair and taunt me constantly. It was {{relentless}} and he made my life a living hell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{does not}} seem much {{difficulty}} in it," [...] he said. [...] "I can speak {{with you in the}} dialect of Dongola, but the Baggara language is much easier to me, because I have been accustomed to speak Arabic since I was a child. <b>Of</b> course <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> will be dyed, and I shall wear the Dervish dress. There is no difficulty in this matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} in my last" [...] (he wrote), [...] "that the {{discoloration}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> had begun. The complexion which you were once so good as to admire, has disappeared for ever. I am now of a livid ashen color--so like death, that I sometimes startle myself when I look in the glass. In about six weeks more, as the doctor calculates, this will deepen to a blackish blue; and then, 'the saturation' (as he calls it) will be complete.|$|E
6000|$|My lovers suffocate me, [...] Crowding my lips, {{thick in}} the pores <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> [...] Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked {{to me at}} night, [...] Crying by day, Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, {{swinging}} and [...] chirping over my head, [...] Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush, [...] Lighting on every moment of my life, [...] Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses, [...] Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.|$|E
60|$|Nielsen {{started with}} a laugh. The man courted peril. The bright face of danger must have been {{beautiful}} and alluring to him. I started after him--caught up with him--and stayed beside him. I could not have walked behind him over that strip of treacherous sink-hole. If I could have done so the whole adventure would have been meaningless to me. Nevertheless I was frightened. I felt the prickle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> the stiffening of my hair, {{as well as the}} cold tingling thrills along my veins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pish! a fig for its talk!" [...] cried Hercules, {{with another}} hitch of his shoulders. [...] "Just take the sky upon your head one instant, will you?

It really chafes me, and will cause {{unnecessary}} inconvenience in so many centuries as I am to stand here." ...|$|R
50|$|From 2000, her {{interest}} turned toward personal and small community history. These series <b>of</b> works (<b>My</b> <b>Skins</b> 2005, Time Leap 2007-8) are {{the appropriation of}} her family past, an experiment {{with the nature of}} memory and post memory work. In <b>My</b> <b>Skins,</b> a series <b>of</b> leather curtains and leather wall carpets with embossing and pencil drawing, she used swine leather again, referring to childhood memory. After the 56 revolution in Hungary Csáky's grandfather was compelled to live in a self-maintaining farm where he also produced animal hides. The pencil drawings on the leather are based on old family photographs from the artist’s childhood.|$|R
60|$|From my {{forehead}} {{the hand of}} the sneaking thern had reached out through the concealing darkness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bed-chamber and wiped away a patch of the disguising red pigment as broad as my palm. Beneath showed the tanned texture <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own white <b>skin.</b>|$|R
60|$|For all his {{expressed}} {{admiration of}} my literary and scientific acumen, Brown {{did not see}} fit to invite me to dinner, probably because of my rusty suit and frayed cuffs. I did not blame him. I was in truth a shabby figure, and the dark-brown beard which had come upon me added to the unhealthy pallor <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> so that Mrs. Brown, a rather smart and socially ambitious lady, must have regarded me as something of an anarchist, a person to avoid. She always smiled as we met, but her smile was defensive.|$|E
60|$|Observing one {{of these}} in my Microscope, I found, in the first place, that all the Body, Legs, Horns and the Stalks of the Wings, were covered over with various kinds of curious white Feathers, which did, with {{handling}} or touching, easily rubb off and fly about, in so much that looking on my Fingers, with which I had handled this Moth, and perceiving on them little white specks, I found by my Microscope, that they were several of the small Feathers of this little creature, that stuck {{up and down in}} the rugosities <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>Skin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I 'most {{jumped out}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> for joy. I {{reckoned}} Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off; {{but if you}} believe me he set there like a rock, and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might lose it if he didn't speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn't know what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and I could a shot him for it: ...|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} release <b>of</b> Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin,</b> the musical style of [...] "Take Me Away" [...] was {{strongly}} compared with American rock band Evanescence. James R. Minchin III of Entertainment Weekly spoke out that Lavigne has transformed into a dour teen {{who seems to have}} spent way too much time listening to Evanescence. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that Lavigne's sound was now much heavier and darker and compared her to Amy Lee, the co-founder and lead vocalist of Evanescence.|$|R
50|$|Robinson's {{production}} {{credits include}} Days <b>of</b> Glory, Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin,</b> and Two Flags West, {{all of which}} he scripted as well. He also worked on three weeks of re-writes for Casablanca, but was uncredited. In 1935, Robinson was a write-in candidate for what was then called the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay {{for his work on}} Captain Blood.|$|R
2500|$|On a more {{negative}} note, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic writes, [...] "... Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin</b> {{is a bit}} awkward, sometimes sounding tentative and unsure, sometimes clicking and surging on Avril's attitude and ambition." [...] Erlewine compared Lavigne to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Cinquemani called Lavigne's [...] "biggest weakness" [...] her lyrics and Strickland agreed, stating [...] "we have a maturing Ms Lavigne, distancing herself from the teen antics of her [...] "Let Go" [...] debut, but struggling to find any stories worth telling". Tim O'Neil of PopMatters stated [...] "Lavigne's songwriting on the bulk <b>of</b> Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin</b> just seems rote" [...] {{and goes on to}} call Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin</b> [...] "a good, if slightly disappointing, follow-up". The Guardians Alexis Petridis lambasted the album, calling it a [...] "flesh-eating virus" [...] and criticised the lyrics, stating [...] "the music is so anodyne that you don't pay much attention to Lavigne's lyrics. This proves to be a small mercy". Under <b>My</b> <b>Skin</b> is included in an article about Petridis' worst reviewed albums of modern times.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay! that's the way {{the young}} dogs always bark afore they're broke in, and gets to like it, as the eels does skinning. Haven't I bounced pretty near out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> many a time afore now, on this here very bridge, with [...] "Harry, jump in, you stupid hound!" [...] and [...] "Harry, get out, you one-eyed tailor!" [...] And then, {{if one of the}} gentlemen lost a fish with their clumsiness--Oh, Father! to hear 'em let out at me and my landing-net, and curse fit to fright the devil! [...] Dash their sarcy tongues! Eh! Don't old Harry know their ways? [...] Don't he know 'em, now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said," [...] persisted Pesca, [...] "that my life {{belonged to}} my dear friend, Walter, {{for the rest of}} my days--and so it does. I said that I should never be happy again till I had found the {{opportunity}} of doing a good Something for Walter--and I have never been contented with myself till this most blessed day. Now," [...] cried the enthusiastic little man at the top of his voice, [...] "the overflowing happiness bursts out of me at every pore <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> like a perspiration; for on my faith, and soul, and honour, the something is done at last, and the only word to say now is--Right-all-right!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honourable men do {{not change}} their {{religion}} for profit, sheik. You were born a follower of the Prophet, I was born a Christian. We both believe what we were taught as children; {{it is in our}} blood and cannot be changed. Were I to say the words that would make me a Mohammedan, you know well that I should say them with my lips and not with my heart, that I should be a false Mohammedan as well as a false Christian. I could as easily change the colour <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> as my religion, and you in your heart {{would be the first to}} condemn and despise me did I do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's no use. Give me {{something}} to make me sleep. I tell you I'm nearly mad. I don't know what I say half my time. For three weeks I've had to think and spell out every word that has come through my lips before I dared say it. Isn't that enough to drive a man mad? I can't see things correctly now, and I've lost <b>my</b> sense <b>of</b> touch. <b>My</b> <b>skin</b> aches--my skin aches! Make me sleep. Oh, Spurstow, {{for the love of}} God make me sleep sound.

40|$|I am {{continually}} {{surprised by}} the acts of estrangement in which my body engages. All bodies do this to some extent – lungs breathe, hearts beat and so on, but with psoriasis, which my article is concerned with, these processes are highly visible. As a condition of the skin, it is a pathology which is enacted both within and without, visible to the social world as well emerging from some little understood inflammatory source within the body. This article will undertake a phenomenological exploration <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>skin</b> and how <b>my</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body is affected by its lack of compliance with medicine, cosmetics etc. By some unknown causation it flakes, breaks, itches constantly drawing attention to bodily limits {{and the limits of}} medical knowledge. I want to think through the meanings we ascribe to such inflammatory conditions in Western society, how <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> materialises at the nexus of industrialisation, medicine, class and capital. This investigation will emerge at the limit point, the thin skin between the subjective and objective, observing and theorising <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> in ways which dissolve disciplinary boundaries, to comprehend the cultural, biological and environmental forces that work upon my body, estranging it from me...|$|R
25|$|I {{am proud}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> white <b>skin,</b> {{just as a}} Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race {{is not a man}} at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian {{community}} as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.|$|R
60|$|Even {{when the}} lessons are done, {{the worst is}} yet to happen, {{in the shape of}} an appalling sum. This is invented for me, and {{delivered}} to me orally by Mr. Murdstone, and begins, 'If I go into a cheesemonger's shop, and buy five thousand double-Gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each, present payment'--at which I see Miss Murdstone secretly overjoyed. I pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until dinner-time, when, having made a Mulatto of myself by getting the dirt of the slate into the pores <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> I have a slice of bread to help me out with the cheeses, and am considered in disgrace {{for the rest of the}} evening.|$|E
60|$|It {{is not out}} of disrespect to my 'Peerage,' which I {{love and}} honour, (indeed, have I not said before, that I should be ready to jump out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin</b> if two Dukes would walk down Pall Mall with me?)--it {{is not out of}} disrespect for the individuals, that I wish these titles had never been invented; but, consider, if there were no tree, there would be no shadow; and how much more honest society would be, and how much more {{serviceable}} the clergy would be (which is our present consideration), if these temptations of rank and continual baits of worldliness were not in existence, and perpetually thrown out to lead them astray.|$|E

[...] "If you'll take the trouble to examine my back, you'll find on it the marks of the lashes I got for just telling my Captain that it was ag'in the grain for me, a republican as I was by idee and natur', to fight other republicans. He told, me he would first try the grain <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>skin,</b> and see how that would agree with what he called my duty; and I must own, he got the best on't; I fit like a tiger ag'in you, rather than be flogged twice the same day.
