40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on visualisation, {{comparison}} and modification <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> interval solvers for solving a continuous constraint satisfaction problem.

The approximation <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> solvers is transformed into the problem of visual reallocation of the sets <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> solvers on a finer level than interval box level. Main part of the thesis is the program on added CD that allows visualisation, comparison and modification <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> interval solvers. The program is written in C++, but can be compiled as a MEX file for MATLAB. A user documentation and a technical documentation for the program are included in the thesis.
