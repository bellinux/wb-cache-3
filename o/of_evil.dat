5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> had been put to rest.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar {{to the formation of}} habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E

Some lack immunity to this disease <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E

Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces <b>of</b> <b>Evil,</b> modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability {{to live up to}} modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception.|$|E

5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E
5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's concept <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> in {{the eighteenth}} century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E

5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> was unsound.|$|E

5|$|Link: The Faces <b>of</b> <b>Evil,</b> Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The Faces <b>of</b> <b>Evil</b> and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or time for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E

5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely in the face <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga {{did not attempt to}} demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E

Black began his inquisition, questioning the advocates about their Evils.

Black asked the advocates to predict what would happen if their Evil continued to spread. The Ripple <b>of</b> <b>Evils</b> used absurd, comedic logic and were generally very silly. After the advocates gave their closing arguments, Black asked for the audience's opinion, which he seldom followed, and announced his verdict and the loser's sentence.|$|R
