40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} integrate dynamic traffic models and location choice models in a more consistent way than the four-step planning scheme.

Mode choice is omitted. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> short <b>run,</b> <b>the</b> car travelers select the departure time and route for <b>the</b> primary activity. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> short <b>run,</b> <b>the</b> travel demand is disaggregated at <b>the</b> individual level. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> long <b>run,</b> users characteristics are aggregated. A methodology is developed {{that can be used}} to bootstrap multi-agents simulations in an efficient way. The emphasis is put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> provision of an operational module. Therefore, <b>the</b> paper focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> technical details of the implementation of this methodology and on its applications to large-scale systems.
