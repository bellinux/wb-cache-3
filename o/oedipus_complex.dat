5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex,</b> which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
25|$|The {{legend of}} Oedipus has been retold in many versions, {{and was used}} by Sigmund Freud to name and give mythic {{precedent}} to the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{story is}} a retelling of the Oresteia by Aeschylus. The {{characters}} parallel characters from the ancient Greek play. For example, Agamemnon from the Oresteia becomes General Ezra Mannon. Clytemnestra becomes Christine, Orestes becomes Orin, Electra becomes Lavinia, Aegisthus becomes Adam Brant, etc. As a Greek tragedy made modern, the play features murder, adultery, incestuous love and revenge, and even a group of townspeople who function {{as a kind of}} Greek chorus. Though fate alone guides characters' actions in Greek tragedies, O'Neill's characters have motivations grounded in 1930s-era psychological theory as well. The play can easily be read from a Freudian perspective, paying attention to various characters' <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complexes</b> and Electra complexes.|$|R

25|$|Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) gave {{explanations}} of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In Totem and Taboo, he applied {{the idea of the}} <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud, and {{psychoanalysis}} after him, saw {{the father}} complex, {{and in particular}} ambivalent feelings for the father {{on the part of}} the male child, as an aspect of the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex.</b> By contrast, Carl Jung took the view that both males and females could have a father complex, which in turn might be either positive or negative.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott's {{theoretical}} elusiveness {{has been}} linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views. But whereas from a Kleinian standpoint, his repudiation of the concepts of envy and the death instinct were a resistant retreat from the harsh realities she had found in infant life, he has also been accused of being too close to Klein: of sharing in her regressive shift of focus away from the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> to the pre-oedipal.|$|E
5000|$|In Chapter 13, titled, 'The Children of Colonial Psychoanalysis', Yvette Rosser {{throws a}} light how Freudian theory, {{designed}} for psychiatric disorders, had been applied by western scholars to analyze Hindu culture since {{the colonial era}} starting from the works of Owen Berkely-Hill and C.D Daly. She argues that a similar approach {{continues to this day}} in the works of Caldwell, Doniger, Courtright, Kripal etc. Chapter 14 is a response by Y. Krishnan to the application of Freudian theory by Paul Courtright which depicts [...] "Fight between Shiva and Ganesha" [...] as <b>Oedipus</b> and castration <b>complex.</b> Y. Krishnan proclaims, by referring the original Hindu scriptural sources (various Puranas), that [...] "core Freudian assumptions simply do not apply to Ganesha and Shiva and also Western scholars have stretched the facts to fit their thesis".Yvette Rosser analyzes Somnath Bhattacharya's essay titled [...] "Kali&#039;s Child : Psychological and Hermeneutical Problems"; which scrutinizes Kripal&#039;s work. Rosser writes that Bhattacharya, being a professional psychotherapist, fluent in Bengali, practitioner of Indian religion and philosophy, and familiar with the primary texts quoted in the Kripal&#039;s work, is 'uniquely qualified to assess Kripal&#039;s work'. She further says that during his analysis, Prof. Bhattacharya was &#039;struck by countless mistranslations, factual errors and denigrating attitude towards the subject'. in the essay, Bhattacharya cites several examples which he thinks are de-contextualization of Ramakrishna&#039;s life events to prove his imagined homosexuality. He further argues that some of the events described by Kripal in his book to prove homosexual inclination of Ramakrishna are 'so naive that even an ordinary Indian can infer that they are not even remotely connected to sexual orientation in Indian context'. He then concludes that Kripal shows an evident cultural bias in his work and the problems therein can be resolved by honest self-analysis and objective study of all personality-aspects of Sri Ramakrishna.|$|R
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{propose that}} myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological {{forces at work}} in those cultures. Some Freudian thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of Oedipus in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> in those cultures. Likewise, Jungians have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from archetypes present in the unconscious levels of every person's mind.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a slight}} romantic aspect to the story, which is {{sometimes}} played down or omitted completely. Wendy's flirtatious desire to kiss Peter, his desire for a mother figure, his conflicting feelings for Wendy, Tiger Lily, and Tinker Bell (each representing different female archetypes), and the symbolism of his fight with Captain Hook (traditionally played by the same actor as Wendy's father), all could possibly hint at a Freudian interpretation (see <b>oedipus</b> <b>complex).</b> Most children's adaptations of the play, including the 1953 Disney film, omit any romantic themes between Wendy and Peter, but Barrie's 1904 original, his 1911 novelisation, the 1954 Mary Martin musical, the 1924 and 2003 feature films, all hint at the romantic elements.|$|E
25|$|The final {{defection}} from Freud's {{inner circle}} occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's The Trauma of Birth which {{other members of}} the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>Complex</b> as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory. Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris. His place on the committee was taken by Anna Freud. Rank eventually settled in the United States where his revisions of Freudian theory were to influence a new generation of therapists uncomfortable with the orthodoxies of the IPA.|$|E
25|$|Accompanied by Ovtchinnikova and {{a student}} of Malinowski, Prince Peter {{embarked}} on a voyage to Asia in September 1937. The party passed through Syria and Persia before reaching British India, {{in search of a}} tribe that Peter could study. They arrived in what is now Pakistan in early 1938, and Peter conducted research in the regions of Lahore, Kulu, Leh, and Srinagar. In Kagil he visited the tomb of the Danish traveler Polycarpus Lindqvist that died there in 1930 by adding an inscription. Wishing to avoid the Himalayan winter, they moved to South India and spent time with the Toda people. They visited the Nilgiris district, Madras, Kalimpong and finally Ceylon. Throughout the entire journey, Peter focused his attention on the study of polyandry – an interest that may have resulted from the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
25|$|Freudian analysts {{claim that}} all sons {{feel they are}} in {{competition}} with their father and often feel in a battle against the father. This is well represented in Greek mythology as Chronos, {{the father of the}} gods, is in constant war with his children should they contradict him. This dominant patriarchal attitude still has roots in society today as men are viewed to be heads of families. (Sigmund Freud referred to this as <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex.)</b> Freudian psychologists claim that the risk the son runs is that in some cases it is more difficult to win the battle against the father than to lose the battle against the father. This is because a common result of winning the battle against the father is that the son suffers tremendous guilt.|$|E
25|$|In {{creating}} psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic {{techniques such}} as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression. On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego and super-ego. Freud postulated the existence of libido, an energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression and neurotic guilt. In his later work Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in psychosexual development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able {{to let go of the}} rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Sigmund Freud {{presented}} {{his theory of}} psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? is a 1956 book by the {{psychoanalyst}} Edmund Bergler, {{in which}} the author argues that homosexuality is a curable illness. Bergler denies that homosexuality is caused by hormonal or other biological factors, the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex,</b> or having a dominant mother and a weak or absent father, instead attributing {{both male and female}} homosexuality to pre-Oedipal factors involving an unsolved masochistic conflict with the mother during the earliest period of infancy. According to Bergler, homosexuality in men reflects unconscious fear and hatred of women. Bergler argues that there are several different types of homosexuality, each with a distinct clinical profile. Bergler rejects the existence of bisexuality, maintaining that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, and criticizes the work of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. He characterizes homosexual men as sexually promiscuous, and argues that this promiscuity is a result of their unsatisfying sex lives and masochistic craving for danger. Bergler argues against immediately repealing laws against homosexuality, though he suggests that such laws could perhaps be repealed in the future if other measures against homosexuality proved effective. Bergler proposes the publicizing of his ideas as a measure against homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothman {{has written}} in The New Yorker that [...] "we {{tell the story}} wrong when we say that Freud used {{the idea of the}} <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> to {{understand}} Hamlet". Rothman suggests that [...] "it was the other way around: Hamlet helped Freud understand, and perhaps even invent, psychoanalysis". He concludes, [...] "The <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> is a misnomer. It should be called the 'Hamlet complex'." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages {{volume on}} Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a {{conviction}} that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded {{the capacity of the}} Freudian <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: [...] "For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>Complex</b> upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet, or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?" [...] The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he [...] "did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses, where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet." ...|$|E

As a [...] "style parody", the song does not take directly from any single Doors song, but Yankovic transposed parts from various songs and combined them into what became [...] "Craigslist". According to NPR, the intro organ riffs are similar to [...] "When the Music's Over", the [...] "snotty barista" [...] section is [...] "a pitch-perfect rip" [...] of the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> section from [...] "The End", and there are sections in the guitar solo similar to [...] "Light My Fire".|$|E
500|$|The main {{antagonist}} to Otoha is [...] His back-story states {{he was the}} Karas of Tokyo {{since the}} Edo period. In events {{before the start of}} the show, Eko turned his back on his duties and started a plan to revitalize the city and its Yōkai. He attracted several yōkai to be his cybernetic followers and intended to subjugate the humans. An <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> forms the basis for his motive. He views Tokyo as a father figure, and his Yurine as a mother figure; and aims to supplant the city's role in this relationship. Eko was a nameless character in the initial draft and known as [...] "Another Karas" [...] with a different appearance, although his prosthetic left leg is retained for the final version.|$|E
500|$|Natalia Oreiro plays Esperanza Muñoz, {{a female}} boxer nicknamed [...] "La Monita". Oreiro was {{inspired}} by the singer Gilda to outline the character's personality. The main location is a tenement in the neighborhood of La Boca where Esperanza lives with other characters.

The writers drafted Quique's general outlines; Belloso defined most of his personality, including the relationship with Esperanzawhich is halfway between engagement and brotherhoodand his <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> with his mother.

500|$|Connor {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared with other}} male characters of the series {{in terms of the}} presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon, he found it interesting that the ancient <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> continues {{to be used as a}} way to underscore one's masculinity, but he added that [...] "Connor is not the only one [...] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals." [...] Further citing Gwen's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Blue Lotus showed {{evidence}} of Hergé's [...] "left-wing counter-tendency" [...] that rejected his earlier right-wing worldview. He {{believed that this}} was {{partly due to the}} influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Hergé's [...] "European absolutism", and overall thought of it as [...] "the most visually rich of all the Tintin books". Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi– who was poisoned with Raijaijah– inverted [...] "the model of justice ruling the world of the Good". He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have [...] "feline suppleness, a devotion to good causes, and the patience of an animal stalking its prey". He furthermore argued that Didi's desire to behead people when under the poison's influence expressed his <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> and was a substitute for castration.|$|E
500|$|Evangelion {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Anno's own emotional struggles. During {{the production of the}} series, he became interested in mental illness and psychology. According to him, Rei is a schizophrenic character and she represents the unconscious of Shinji. Shinji has an <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex,</b> and is characterized by a libido-destrudo conflict. Similarly, Ritsuko has an Electra complex, in which she loves Gendo, a sort of substitute of her father figure. Anno himself stated that the main character reflects his character, [...] "both in conscious and unconscious part", referring also to Kaworu as his Jungian shadow. It has even been suggested that Shinji's entering into Unit-01 is a Freudian [...] "return to the womb", and that his struggle to be free of the Eva is his [...] "rite of passage" [...] into manhood. The series contains many references to philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts, such as the oral stage, introjection, oral personality, ambivalence, and the death drive, including some elements of the works of Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schopenhauer, Søren Kierkegaard and others.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociologist}} Miriam M. Johnson {{wrote that}} Bell et al.′s {{study was the}} [...] "largest, best-designed, {{and one of the}} least heterosexist investigations" [...] of the development of sexual preference. In her view, its only possible bias is that because of its nature and San Francisco location [...] "activist" [...] homosexuals were over-represented. Johnson argued that [...] "this bias would probably work against finding support for any hypotheses concerning parental influences, because activist homosexuals have ordinarily been opposed to psychoanalytic speculations about parental involvements." [...] Johnson concluded, however, that the study′s credibility was enhanced by the fact that Bell et al. took into account whether their respondents had been exposed to books or articles about the etiology of homosexuality, and disregarded results when they could be explained by such exposure. Johnson credited Bell et al. with showing that [...] "almost all the alleged causes of adult sexual orientation are either nonexistent or highly exaggerated", but considered their claim that they had refuted psychoanalytic theories that attribute homosexuality to an unresolved <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> only [...] "half true", given the father findings.|$|E
2500|$|After Freud's later {{development}} {{of the theory of}} the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> this normative developmental trajectory becomes formulated in terms of the child's renunciation of incestuous desires under the phantasised threat of (or phantasised fact of, {{in the case of the}} girl) castration. The [...] "dissolution" [...] of the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> is then achieved when the child's rivalrous identification with the parental figure is transformed into the pacifying identifications of the Ego ideal which assume both similarity and difference and acknowledge the separateness and autonomy of the other.|$|E
2500|$|Sigmund Freud in Interpretation of Dreams wrote {{a notable}} passage {{regarding}} of {{the destiny of}} Oedipus {{as well as the}} <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex.</b> He analyzes why this play, Oedipus Rex, written in Ancient Greece, is so effective even to a modern audience. [...] Freud says, ...|$|E
2500|$|For Sigmund Freud, [...] "rather {{than being}} a matter only for a {{minority}} of men who identify as homosexual or gay, homoeroticism {{is a part of}} the very formation of all men as human subjects and social actors." [...] Freud's point of view is embedded in his psychoanalytic studies on Narcissism and <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Desire is {{the desire}} of the Other's desire, meaning that desire is the object of another's desire and that desire is also desire for recognition. Here Lacan follows Alexandre Kojève who follows Hegel: for Kojève the subject must risk his own life if he wants to achieve the desired prestige." [...] This desire to be the object of another's desire is best {{exemplified}} in the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex,</b> when the subject desires to be the phallus of the mother.|$|E
2500|$|The {{action of}} the family not only {{performs}} a psychological repression of desire, but it disfigures it, giving rise to a consequent neurotic desire, the perversion of incestuous drives and desiring self-repression. The <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> arises from this double operation: [...] "It is in {{one and the same}} movement that the repressive social production is replaced by the repressing family, and that the latter offers a displaced image of desiring-production that represents the repressed as incestuous familial drives." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} {{and developmental}} psychologist Erik Erikson has given Adolf Hitler {{a chapter in}} his 1950 book, Childhood and Society. Erikson referred to Hitler as an [...] "histrionic and hysterical adventurer" [...] and discovered evidence of an undissolved <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> in his self-portrayals. Nonetheless, {{he pointed out that}} Hitler was such an actor that his self-expression could not be measured with conventional diagnostic tools. Although Hitler had possibly been showing certain psychopathology, he dealt with this in an extremely controlled fashion and utilized it purposefully.|$|E
2500|$|From {{its premiere}} {{at the turn}} of the 17th century, Hamlet has {{remained}} Shakespeare's best-known, most-imitated, and most-analyzed play. The character of Hamlet played a critical role in Sigmund Freud's explanation of the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> and thus influenced modern psychology. Even within the narrower field of literature, the play's influence has been strong. As Foakes writes, [...] "No other character's name in Shakespeare's plays, and few in literature, have come to embody an attitude to life ... and been converted into a noun in this way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Erich Fromm (1900–1980) {{modified}} the Freudian theory {{and produced a}} more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book Psychoanalysis and Religion he responded to Freud's theories by explaining {{that part of the}} modification is viewing the <b>Oedipus</b> <b>complex</b> as based not so much on sexuality as on a [...] "much more profound desire", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.|$|E
