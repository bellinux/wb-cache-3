5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an <b>outright</b> <b>sale.</b> The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E
25|$|However, British Railways {{were later}} {{to change their}} policy {{regarding}} the disposal of disused branch lines and, as they had done with the Bluebell Railway, were no longer prepared to simply lease the line to a private operator. Instead, they now required an <b>outright</b> <b>sale</b> of the line to the Association for £53,000. Thanks to {{the help of an}} anonymous backer, the Association was able to put forward an offer of £30,000 for the track, buildings, land and branch platform at Dunton Green. British Railways accepted this offer subject to the condition that a commuter service be provided, thereby enabling it to cease its annual subsidy of £8,700 towards the additional bus services laid on following the line's closure.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the <b>outright</b> <b>sale</b> of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E

50|$|A {{prolonged}} {{agricultural depression}} in Britain {{at the end}} of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging <b>outright</b> <b>sales,</b> from the mid-20th century.|$|R
25|$|While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV {{switched}} to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an <b>outright</b> <b>sale</b> of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive {{taxes on the}} proceeds from the deal. To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in late 1994. NBC traded KCNC-TV in Denver and KUTV in Salt Lake City (which NBC had acquired earlier that year) to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade—displacing their respective longtime network affiliates, KMGH-TV and KSL-TV. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W {{in return for a}} minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded broadcasting facilities in Miami. The deal officially took effect at 12:30a.m. on September 10, 1995. The final NBC program aired on KYW-TV was a rerun of Saturday Night Live, which began at 11:30p.m. on September 9, 1995.|$|E

5000|$|Investment in land {{often takes}} the form of {{long-term}} leases, as opposed to outright purchases, of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years. Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as “non-private" [...] as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease. Purchases are much less common than leases due to a number of countries’ constitutional bans on <b>outright</b> <b>sales</b> of land to foreigners.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a marketing channel depends on its information structure. It is high when both manufacturer and retailers have accurate information about demand conditions. Accordingly, in the case where only the manufacturer has such information, it has an incentive to transmit its information to the retailers. In the <b>outright</b> <b>sales</b> contracts (spot-market transactions), the manufacturer overstates demand conditions to encourage large orders by the retailers and thus earn a large profit. Hence, the retailers {{do not believe the}} transmitted information. However, in the case in which the manufacturer has to accept any unsold goods, it does not have any incentives to pass on misleading information. Therefore, the retailers believe the transmitted information. In this sense, the liberal returns policy is the basis for efficient communication in the channel...|$|R

40|$|Under a {{revenue-sharing}} contract, {{a retailer}} pays a supplier a wholesale price for each unit purchased plus {{a percentage of}} the revenue the retailer generates. Such contracts have become more prevalent in the video cassette rental industry relative to the more conventional wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each retailer’s purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or <b>outright</b> <b>sales.</b> Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate that revenue sharing coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer (i. e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily allocates the supply chain’s profit. We compare revenue sharing to a number of other supply chain contracts (e. g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts...|$|R

50|$|By {{effectively}} {{ending the}} practice of subinfeudation, Quia Emptores hastened the end of feudalism in England, which had already been on the decline for quite some time. Direct feudal obligations were increasingly being replaced by cash rents and <b>outright</b> <b>sales</b> of land which gave rise to {{the practice of}} livery and maintenance or bastard feudalism, the retention and control by the nobility of land, money, soldiers and servants via direct salaries, land sales and rent payments. This would later develop into one of the underlying causes of the Wars of the Roses, the English civil wars fought by the House of York and House of Lancaster for control of the English Crown from 1455 to 1485. By the mid-fifteenth century the major nobility, particularly the Houses of York and Lancaster, were able to assemble vast estates, considerable sums of money and large private armies on retainer through post-Quia Emptores land management practices and direct sales of land. The two noble Houses thus grew more powerful than the Crown itself, with the consequent wars between them for control of the realm.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a dynamic game to model a monopoly of finitely durable goods. The solution concept is Markov perfect equilibria with general equilibria embedded in every time period. Our model is {{flexible enough to}} simultaneously explain or accommodate many commonly observed phenomena or stylized facts, such as concurrent leasing and selling, active secondary markets for used goods, heterogeneous consumers, endogenous consumption patterns, depreciation, an infinite time horizon, and non-trivial transaction costs. Within our model, consumers have incentives to segment themselves into various consumption classes according to their willingness to pay; and non-trivial transaction costs to sell used goods put strong constraints on consumers consumption sequences in time. As {{a direct consequence of}} the finite durability the market power of the monopolist remains intact. Leasing manifests itself as a facilitator of price discrimination, by de-bundling the durable good into new and used portions that are naturally bundled together under <b>outright</b> <b>sales.</b> The concurrent leasing and selling reflects the degree of the comparative advantage the monopolist has over consumers in disposing used goods. This comparative advantage, which is partially exploited by the monopolist and partially shared by the consumers, provides a sufficient mechanism to gain Pareto improvement on the market...|$|R
