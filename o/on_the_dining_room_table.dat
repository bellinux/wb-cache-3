5|$|FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) {{investigate}} a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story {{again and the}} thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table.</b> As Don prepares {{to return to the}} office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after {{reports of}} the slaying spread, {{blockades}} were set up several miles northeast and southwest on Highway 67 East. Sheriff Davis called in officers from the entire area {{to help in the}} investigation; some of which included two agents from the FBI, Captain Gonzaullas and other Rangers, Sheriff Presley and his deputies, Sheriff Jim Sanderson from Little River County, Arkansas State Police, local police, and many others. In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table</b> was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the [...] "virtual river of blood", stated that [...] "It is beyond me why she did not bleed to death." [...] There were only two bullet holes in the window, leading Sheriff Davis to believe an automatic rifle was used. Investigators declared that after the killer shot Virgil, he waited patiently outside the window to shoot the wife.|$|E

50|$|Williston is a {{historic}} home and farm complex located near Orange, Orange County, Virginia. It was built in 1867, and is a two-story, three bay, Italianate style brick dwelling.

50|$|In {{interpreting}} the act, the earliest houses remained the traditional two storey cottage design but with taller rooms and larger windows, which improved lighting and ventilation. The ground floor contained a front living <b>room</b> and back <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> with <b>the</b> stair column running {{parallel to the}} street, in between. Cooking was possible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> fire- which maybe was a coal burning fire with side oven. Upstairs were two bedrooms. The back window had to be least 10% of the floor area, and to obtain the ventilation, the rising sash design was ubiquitous.|$|R

50|$|At fifteen, Emma met Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, {{who hired}} her {{for several months}} as hostess and {{entertainer}} at a lengthy stag party at Fetherstonhaugh's Uppark country estate in the South Downs.

Emma soon formed a friendship with one of the guests, the dull but sincere Honourable Charles Francis Greville (1749-1809), second son of the then Earl of Warwick and a member of Parliament for Warwick. It was about this time (late June-early July 1781) that she conceived a child by Fetherstonhaugh.|$|E

50|$|Back at the inn, Bartel brings Marc {{into the}} kitchen and they sit down for Christmas dinner. Boris arrives with a calf, {{convinced}} that it is his missing dog. Bartel gives a tearful, impassioned speech about love, togetherness, and the spirit of the holidays, before a sudden rifle shot rings out and a bullet explodes through the inn's window, killing Boris. The villagers lay siege to the inn, rushing the inn with a pig on a leash as one would employ a dog, intent on reclaiming the calf, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are also intent on raping Marc, in the shared delusion that Marc is Bartel's returned wife. The villagers mortally wound Bartel before turning their attention to Marc; one of them then briefly rapes Marc <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
