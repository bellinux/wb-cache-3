A mixture of curry sauces is poured on the rice. This is called 'banjir' (flooding) and imparts a diverse taste to the rice.|$|R
40|$|A phytobezoar {{is one of}} the intraluminal {{causes of}} gastric outlet obstruction, {{especially}} in patients with previous gastric surgery and/or gastric motility disorders. Before the proton pump inhibitor era, vagotomy, pyloroplasty, gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy were commonly performed procedures in peptic ulcer patients. One of the sequelae of gastrojejunostomy is phytobezoar formation. However, a bezoar causing gastric outlet obstruction is rare even with giant gastric bezoars. We report a rare case of gastric outlet obstruction due to a phytobezoar obstructing the efferent limb of the gastrojejunostomy site. This phytobezoar which consisted of a whole piece of <b>okra</b> (<b>lady</b> <b>finger</b> vegetable) was successfully removed by endoscopic snare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of okra bezoar-related gastrojejunostomy efferent limb obstruction reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|<b>Okra</b> (<b>Lady’s</b> <b>finger,</b> Abelmoschus esculentus) fibres were {{introduced}} in a poly(lactic) acid (PLA) polymer matrix as short fibres (5 – 10 mm), in amounts variable between 10 and 30 %wt. For this purpose, both untreated and alkali treated okra fibres were used. The obtained composites, {{in view of the}} envisaged application for sustainable packaging purposes, has been tested morphologically, mechanically and subjected to chemical characterisation, while the biodegradation profile has been studied. The introduction of fibres in the polymer matrix always resulted in a higher stiffness of the obtained composite. The addition of okra fibre to PLA results in an increased ability of the PLA matrix to crystallize due to the nucleation effect of the okra fibre, and this effect was more evident in the composites produced with alkali treated fibres. The biodegradation process was accelerated by the addition of higher contents of fibres into the composites due to preferential degradation of the fibres themselves: this effect was increased when composite fibres are alkali-treated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo isolate and {{evaluate}} comparatively the binding {{efficacy of the}} mucilages obtained from the plants of Hibiscus rosasinensis and Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus). MethodsExtraction of mucilages from the leaves of Hibiscus and pods of <b>Okra</b> (<b>Ladies</b> <b>finger)</b> {{was carried out by}} a cold maceration process. The extracted mucilages were subjected to various physicochemical properties for its suitability as an excipient in the formulation of tablet dosage form. Different concentrations (10, 8, 5, 2 and 1 % w/v) of binder solutions of Hibiscus and Okra were used for the formulation of tablets and the formulated tablets were evaluated by studying the standard parameters like diameter, thickness, weight variation, hardness, friability, disintegration and in vitro dissolution. Stability studies of the formulated tablets were conducted for four weeks. ResultsThe formulated tablets prepared using the mucilages of both Hibiscus and Okra had good appearance. The in vitro drug release profile of the tablets prepared using Okra mucilage had an optimum of 90 % at a mucilage concentration of 1 % w/v concentration mucilage itself within 4 h. ConclusionsAccording to the observations, the lower concentration levels of Okra can be used as an alternative binder to starch. The higher concentration levels of Okra mucilage show a slow and sustained release, and can be considered as an alternative natural excipient in the modified drug delivery systems. At the same time, the above natural excipient of Hibiscus mucilage {{could be used as a}} platform for prolonged release if its binder concentrations are increased...|$|R
40|$|The area {{cultivated}} {{with vegetable}} crops in the State of Qatar reached, during 1979 and 1980, {{a percentage of}} about 42. 9 % of the total cultivated (or suitable to be cultivated) area. Vegetable crops selected for collecting insect pests from them were nineteen in number. They were : tomato, eggplant, pepper, potato, watermelon, cantaloupe, wild cucumber, squash, cucumber, carrot, onion, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, radish, lettuce, chorchorus, <b>okra</b> or <b>ladies</b> <b>fingers</b> and spinach. These vegetables were distributed among several districts located in north, middle and south parts of Qatar. Insect pests collected during the two-year period revealed the following : 1. The total collected insect species were 37 species. 2. Ten species of insect pests, each attacked one vegetable crop only. 3. Four species of insect pests, each attacked two crops only. 4. Three insect species, each attacked three vegetable crops only. 5. Five insect species, each attacked four crops only. 6. Six insect species, each attacked from 5. to 7 vegetable crops. 7.

40|$|The current {{situation}} regarding imports of selected horticultural products from India into the European market in general, and the UK market in particular, is examined. The products selected for review are mango, melon, pomegranate, sapodilla, onion, and various Asian vegetables (okra, tindori, kantola and parval). The potential for either beginning or increasing volumes of sea-shipment is also investigated. In 1994, India exported about 3000 tonnes of mango to Europe, 1000 of which {{went to the}} UK There have already been some sea-shipments of mango to the UK, but {{it is noted that}} although mango has the most potential of all the products examined for increasing volumes of sea-freight, the very fragile Alphonso variety may not survive the long transit time. The Kesar and Pairi varieties may have some promise in this respect, but the low demand for the Rajapuri variety in the UK may limit its potential. Indian exports of melon to Europe are insignificant and accounted for only 0. 001 % of the European market in 1994. The market for melon in the UK is growing substantially, but few traders are optimistic about the possibility of sea-freighting Indian melon, partly because the Indian season coincides with that of Spain against which it has little chance of competing, and partly because many believe that the fruit could not be preserved for the 30 or so days of transit. There is some optimism about the development potential of papaya on European markets. The UK is attracted to good 'eating' papaya with good 'visual quality', but the sources are limited. The main suppliers are currently Brazil, Jamaica and Costa Rica. If the technical problems associated with importing papaya could be overcome, this could be a fast growth area. No disaggregated data are available on the supply of pomegranates to Europe, but small volumes are imported into the UK both by sea and by air. It is generally felt that the UK demand is too low for pomegranates to have much potential. An improvement in the visual quality of the fruit would probably have the greatest impact on its expansion in the UK market. Sapodilla is only traded by Asian wholesalers. It is a very low volume product in the UK and its extremely short shelf-life means that its potential for sea-shipment is not high. Speciality bananas occupy a niche market with small sales. Although there is some potential for market growth, traders feel that the process is unlikely to be rapid. There is little enthusiasm amongst traders for the import of Indian onions. Demand is very low and India {{would not be able to}} compete against the high domestic and European supply. There is also a low demand in the UK for the other Asian vegetables reviewed. Of them all, <b>okra</b> (<b>ladies</b> <b>finger)</b> has the most potential for expansion on the UK market, but there is strong competition from suppliers in Africa, particularly from Kenya. Many traders feel that vegetables are too perishable for successful sea-transport, and their relatively low value on the UK market may not justify increasing exports from India. Fruit and vegetable consumption in the UK is relatively low compared to the rest of Europe, but the UK market does appear to offer opportunities for expansion of horticultural export from India provided that Indian exporters can strengthen their competitive position...|$|R
40|$|According to the literature, {{the tobacco}} plant {{is native to}} Central and South America. With over fifty varieties, tobacco belongs to the {{nightshade}} family which includes belladona (deadly nightshade), peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and <b>okra</b> (also called <b>lady</b> <b>fingers)</b> 8 - 9. Two varieties of tobacco interest us here. One is Nicotiana rustica, or “true tobacc ”, which was used by Native peoples in the Americas long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans. This variety, although not native to North America, has adapted successfully to the climate. Com ercial tobacco such as the one used in cigarettes, is Nicotiana tabacum which was originally grown in South and Central America but was later cultivated success-fully in Virginia where it became a major cash crop 1. “True tobacco”, a milder form than the tobacco used in commercial tobacco products, was widely regarded by North American Indians as a sacred plant and was often cultivated separately from other crops involving specific rituals for sowing and harvesting. It was used in a great number of ceremonies as an essential element of ritual. It could be burnt over the fire, thrown on water, left on the ground or smoked in a pipe that was passed around a circle of people or in individual pipes. In South and Central America where the stronger, larger- leafed Non-Traditional use of Nicotiana Tabacum grew, Indians smoked tobacco in pipes of many shapes and sized, or in the form of cones or “smoking rolls”, sometimes elaborately decorated. In some parts of South America, tobacco was chewed or used as snuff t...|$|R
