5|$|A {{speech of}} Andocides {{indirectly}} concerns epikleroi, as the orator {{claimed that the}} real origin of the dispute between himself and his cousin Leagros was over which <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> claim an heiress that both were related to. Demosthenes' speech Against Macartatus includes a description of Sositheos' claiming of the epikleros Phulomakhe.|$|E
5|$|Cardinal Orsini, the {{official}} {{representative of the}} Neapolitan court, and all the foreigners, were not classified because it was certain that none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be ever elected pope.|$|E
5|$|For this reason, {{direct grant}} schools were {{excluded}} from consideration by the Public Schools Commission set up in 1965, even though 152 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> otherwise have fallen within its remit.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should like}} to see what I can do among the natives. Then there is a {{construction}} train over at the junction, and I know a lot of the fellows. I guess some <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>would</b> like to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was worth}} it," [...] whispered Eddie. [...] "Say, {{but that was}} some scrap. You got your nerve standin' up there against the bunch of 'em; but if you hadn't they'd have rushed us and some <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>would</b> a-got in." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1963, {{three major}} {{commuter}} groups in New Jersey made expansion proposals. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have involved {{an extension of}} the IRT Flushing Line under the Hudson River with a three-track tunnel and then connect with the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running from}} Hunters Point in Queens heading {{southeast}} to Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. The line {{would consist of}} between two and four tracks, and at Lafayette Avenue, the line would split. Two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> continue as a Lafayette Avenue, but would then become four tracks. The remaining two tracks would run to Franklin and Flatbush Avenues.|$|E
5|$|After the defeats at {{the battles}} at Ostrach and Stockach, and the Army of the Danube's retreat into the Black Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command {{of both the}} Army of Switzerland and the Army of the Danube to André Masséna. Protecting the {{northern}} access to Zürich, Masséna gathered {{some of the best}} commanders he had available; eventually, three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> become Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a dependable General of Division.|$|E

5|$|Brunner's term as Ohio Secretary of State ends in 2011 and {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 2010 along with other Ohio statewide offices. In January, rumors that were eventually confirmed began circulating that second term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not run {{for re-election}} in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E
5|$|International {{publishers}} expressed {{some interest}} in carrying Elmer, but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> commit to it. To generate more interest among readers, Alanguilan released the sold-out first issue for free online. This led publisher Editions Ca Et La to purchase the French rights in 2010. After Alanguilan exchanged emails with publisher Dan Vado, Slave Labor Graphics released Elmer as a 144-page trade paperback in North America. Slave Labor Graphics also distributes the comic digitally.|$|E
5|$|Major General William Bridges {{decided that}} the Duntroon cadets, none of whom had yet {{finished}} their training, should be split up and posted to the various units of the AIF as regimental rather than staff officers. Robertson was posted to the 10th Light Horse as its machine-gun officer. He was one of seven members of his class in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. By the end of August 1915, three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't {{make any}} {{difference}} whether they could or not. You've got to mind your eye, {{if you want to}} keep out of jail, an' yellin' to me ain't the way to do it. If the folks 'round here should know I was on this case, jest as likely as not some <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>would</b> send word to the city, an' then your game would be up." ...|$|R

5|$|Of the 73 skiers who won {{medals at}} these championships, 34 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> {{medal at the}} Winter Olympics in Vancouver the {{following}} year. Three of the skiers who won {{the world championships in}} their respective events, Bill Demong in the nordic combined 10km individual large hill, Justyna Kowalczyk in the cross-country skiing women's 30km, and Petter Northug in the cross-country skiing men's 50km, would win Olympic gold in those same events.|$|E
5|$|Of the six Gordmans stores {{located in}} Minnesota, the chain issued {{a press release}} in April 2017 stating that five <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> close in 2017; additionally, 48 out of their 98 {{locations}} nationwide would close. The Southdale location was expected to close soon after the release. Following the announcement of JCPenney closing nine stores throughout Minnesota, the Southdale Center location was listed {{as one of them}} on June 2, 2017. It closed on July 31, 2017. It will be replaced by a Life Time Fitness and additional retail tenants will replace the former location.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Dyrholm both {{attempted}} {{to capitalize on}} the party's election win, proclaiming that Albertans wanted change and that each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> lead the Wildrose Alliance to a victory in the next general election. The party experienced a considerable growth heading into the leadership election, announcing it had 11,670 members at the beginning of October, compared to 1,800 in June. Smith was elected the new leader at the convention held in Edmonton on October 17.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{about a dozen}} below that'll weigh ten {{or fifteen}} pounds apiece," [...] he said grimly in reply to Joe's {{question}} of what he intended to do with such primitive weapons.

5|$|The Irons {{permanently}} adopted claret {{and blue}} for home colours {{in the summer}} of 1899. Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> win.|$|E
5|$|The good {{understanding}} between the patroons of the Amsterdam Chamber left {{nothing to be}} desired; Burgh, Godyn, Blommaert, and Van Rensselaer, before signifying to the directors their willingness to start colonies, made an agreement to work the projected colonies on joint account, each {{under the direction of}} one of them. Three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> have a one-fifth share in each colony, while the fourth would receive the remaining two fifths, taking the responsibility for its management and exercising patroon rights.|$|E
5|$|The partisans arrested Mussolini {{and took}} him to Dongo, where he spent part of the night in the local barracks. In all, over fifty fascist leaders and their {{families}} were found in the convoy and arrested by the partisans. Aside from Mussolini and Petacci, sixteen of the most prominent <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be summarily shot in Dongo the following day and a further ten would be killed over two successive nights.|$|E

5|$|Tucker and Allie Clark both {{attempted}} to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of Harry Simpson and Minnie Miñoso made it likely that one or both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> be traded or released. Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their Triple-A minor league affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League; his last major league game was April 29.|$|E
5|$|In September 1950, on Collins' {{orders the}} Ranger Training Center {{was moved to}} Fort Benning, Georgia, and in October the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Companies began training. The {{effective}} employment of the Eighth Army Ranger Company had demonstrated {{the viability of the}} concept to Army planners, and the subsequent Chinese attacks in November reinforced the need for more such units. As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> see combat in Korea.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>would</b> reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, {{and within a few}} weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
