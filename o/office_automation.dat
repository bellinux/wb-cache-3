5|$|The 1969 Mansfield Amendment, {{which ended}} {{military}} funding of non-military research, {{the end of}} the Vietnam War, and {{the end of the}} Apollo program reduced ARC's funding from DARPA and NASA. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of artificial intelligence researcher Bertram Raphael, who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called Tymshare. Engelbart's house in Atherton, California burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff including its creator as a Senior Scientist, renamed the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its new <b>Office</b> <b>Automation</b> Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{spatial data}} are totally {{widespread}} in mobile applications. They {{are present in}} games, map applications, web community applications and <b>office</b> <b>automations.</b> However this kind of spatial information potentially needs a large display area and the hardware constraint related to the limited screen dimensions creates many usability challenges. Our investigation {{in the last few}} years to find solutions to these challenges has led us to the discovery of general usability principles that a well-designed interface should adopt. In this paper we describe the mental path we have followed to derive those principles from the experience gained in developing mobile interfaces for different application domains. The principles are formalized in terms of two interaction design patterns, specific for mobile interfaces managing spatial data. They extend existing HCI patterns and are completed, as usual, with concrete examples of their applications...|$|R
2500|$|Inslaw {{began as}} a {{non-profit}} organization called the Institute for Law and Social Research. The Institute was founded in 1973 by William A. Hamilton to develop case management software for law enforcement <b>office</b> <b>automation.</b> Funded by grants and contracts from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), the Institute developed a program it called [...] "Promis", an acronym for Prosecutors' Management Information System, for use in law enforcement record keeping and case-monitoring activities. When Congress voted to abolish the LEAA in 1980, Hamilton decided to continue operating as a for-profit corporation and market the software to current and new users. In January 1981 Hamilton established the for-profit Inslaw, transferring the Institute's assets over to the new corporation.|$|E

When Inslaw learned of the installations, it notified EOUSA that this was in violation of Modification 12 and filed a claim for $2.9m, which Inslaw said was the license fees for the software DOJ self-installed. Inslaw also filed claims for services performed during the contract, for a total of $4.1m. The DOJ contracting officer, Peter Videnieks, denied all these claims.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Office</b> {{activity}} procedure <b>automation</b> {{is getting}} {{very popular in}} major organizations. During the automation then workflow method is chosen frequently, because of its possibility to reflect real world business processes in a transparent and informative way. By automating such activities, organization gains a possibility to share resources between distant company departments, shortens the activity fulfillment time, and reaches work efficiency. It’s a pity, but workflow doesn’t support real world deviations, which often occur during document or project preparation. Every possible exception or deviation must be foreseen during the process build-time. The most difficult to solve are run-time exceptions. They are difficult to catch, their impact to the process can be determinant to the final goal and they irritate the user most of all. This paper focuses on the business process, modeled using workflow exception handling, and exception impact to the business process and user reliance on the system. The proposed decomposed workflow method shows how an <b>office</b> activity <b>automation</b> application could reach flexibility and support run-time exceptions. Combining the solutions of all mentioned above problems into a consistent solution, the exception handling could be achieved in a flexible way...|$|R
