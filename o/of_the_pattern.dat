5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pattern.)</b> Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{seven years}} after his arrest in 1982, Andrew Wilson filed a civil suit against four detectives (including Burge), a former police superintendent, and the City of Chicago. He {{said that he had}} been beaten, suffocated with a plastic bag, burned (by {{cigarette}} and radiator), and treated with electric shock by police officers when interrogated about the February 1982 murders; he also had been the victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> of a police and city cover-up.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{experimental}} realization of pattern formation in a spatially extended nonlinear system {{when the system}} is alternated between two states, neither of which exhibits patterning. Dynamical equations modeling the system are used for both numerical simulations and a weakly nonlinear analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterned</b> states. <b>The</b> simulations show excellent agreement with the experiment. The nonlinear analysis provides an explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterning</b> under alternation and accurately predicts both <b>the</b> observed dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterning</b> on <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> alternation and <b>the</b> measured spatial frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> identifying <b>the</b> parameters {{involved in}} <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> spatial <b>patterns</b> in nonlinear two dimensional systems. To this aim, we perform numerical experiments on a prototypical model generating morphogenetic Turing patterns, by changing both the spatial frequency and shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns.</b> <b>The</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> {{and their relationship}} with the model parameters are characterized by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Generalized Recurrence Quantification measures. We show that the recurrence measures Determinism and Recurrence Entropy, as well as <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line lengths, allow for a full characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> in terms <b>of</b> power law decay with respect to the parameters involved in <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> their spatial frequency and shape. A comparison with the standard two dimensional Fourier transform is performed and the results show a better performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recurrence indicators in identifying a reliable connection with <b>the</b> spatial frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns.</b> Finally, in order to evaluate <b>the</b> robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power low decay, extensive simulations have been performed by adding different levels <b>of</b> noise to <b>the</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

5|$|Before the {{formation}} of Hurricane Kate, a ridge was located across the southeastern United States {{for much of the}} autumn of 1985; concurrently, a major trough persisted across the western portion of the country. As a result, weather conditions across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> in late September, including sea surface temperatures of 81°F (27°C). On November13, a weak tropical wave began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions, and on November15, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area indicated the development of a tropical cyclone. As gale force winds were already present, the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate, about 240miles (385km) northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> of late {{marriage}} {{for both men}} and women (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls from the social elite married in their teens, most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s. They could also act as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hastings and Levitov (HL) algorithm for {{simulation of}} diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) restricted in a sector geometry is studied. It is {{found that this}} generalization with uniform measure produces "wedge-like" fractal <b>patterns</b> in <b>the</b> physical space, whose fractal dimension and anisotropy exponent depend significantly on the opening angle β <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sector. The morphological properties and <b>the</b> overall shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> are analyzed by computing the angular two-point density correlation function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns.</b> We also find that <b>the</b> fractal dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> with sinusoidal distributed measure depend weakly on β with almost the same dimension as the radial DLA cluster.

5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the epicenter is usually close to the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pattern,</b> but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented {{as an example of a}} distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of the felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E
