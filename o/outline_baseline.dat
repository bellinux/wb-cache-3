40|$|A {{fission reactor}} {{combined}} with Stirling convertor power generation is one promising candidate in on-going Fission Surface Power (FSP) studies for future lunar and Martian bases. There are many challenges for designing and qualifying space-rated nuclear power plants. In {{order to have}} an affordable and sustainable program, NASA and DOE designers want to build upon the extensive foundation in nuclear fuels and structural materials. This talk will outline the current Fission Surface Power program and <b>outline</b> <b>baseline</b> design options for a lunar power plant {{with an emphasis on}} materials challenges. NASA first organized an Affordable Fission Surface Power System Study Team to establish a reference design that could be scrutinized for technical and fiscal feasibility. Previous papers and presentations have discussed this study process in detail. Considerations for the reference design included that no significant nuclear technology, fuels, or material development were required for near term use. The desire was to build upon terrestrial-derived reactor technology including conventional fuels and materials. Here we will present an overview of the reference design, Figure 1, and examine the materials choices. The system definition included analysis and recommendations for power level and life, plant configuration, shielding approach, reactor type, and power conversion type. It {{is important to note that}} this is just one concept undergoing refinement. The design team, however, understands that materials selection and improvement must be an integral part of the system development...|$|E

This paper <b>outlines</b> <b>baseline</b> {{results of a}} coproduction evaluation of an asset-based approach to improving health and well-being within a small community through promoting tobacco control. Local residents were recruited and trained as community researchers to deliver a smoking prevalence survey within their local community and became local health champions, promoting health and well-being. The results of the survey {{will be used to}} inform health promotion activities within the community. The local smoking prevalence was higher than the regional and national averages. Half of the households surveyed had at least one smoker, and 63. 1 % of children lived in a smoking household. Nonsmokers reported higher well-being than smokers; however, the differences were not significant.

40|$|Payments for {{environmental}} services (PES) represent a new, more direct way to promote conservation. They explicitly {{recognize the need}} to address difficult trade-offs by bridging the interests of landowners and external actors through compensations. Theoretical assessments praise the advantages of PES over indirect approaches, but in the tropics PES application has remained incipient. Here I aim to demystify PES and clarify its scope for application {{as a tool for}} tropical conservation. I focus on the supply side of PES (i. e., how to convert PES funding into effective conservation on the ground), which until now has been widely neglected. I reviewed the PES literature for developing countries and combined these findings with observations from my own field studies in Latin America and Asia. A PES scheme, simply stated, is a voluntary, conditional agreement between at least one “seller” and one “buyer” over a well-defined environmental service—or a land use presumed to produce that service. Major obstacles to effective PES include demand-side limitations and a lack of supply-side know-how regarding implementation. The design of PES programs can be improved by explicitly <b>outlining</b> <b>baselines,</b> calculating conservation opportunity costs, customizing payment modalities, and targeting agents with credible land claims and threats to conservation. Expansion of PES can occur if schemes can demonstrate clear additionality (i. e., incremental conservation effects vis-`a-vis predefined baselines), if PES recipients’ livelihood dynamics are better understood, and if efficiency goals are balanced with considerations of fairness. PES are arguably best suited to scenarios of moderate conservation opportunity costs on marginal lands and in settings with emerging, not-yet realized threats. Actors who represent credible threats to the environment will more likely receive PES than those already living in harmony with nature. A PES scheme can thus benefit both buyers and sellers while improving the resource base, but it is unlikely to fully replace other conservation instrumen...|$|R

In an application of the model we study the interaction between labor-market institutions and monetary policy choices, and the consequences for welfare outcomes.

Nowadays, an increasingly larger number of map-based applications enable users to ask {{a wider variety of}} queries. Researchers have studied the ride-sharing, the carpooling, the vehicle routing, and the collective travel planning problems extensively in recent years. Collective traveling has the benefit of being environment-friendly by reducing the global travel cost, the greenhouse gas emission, and the energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce several optimization problems to recommend a suitable route and stops of a vehicle, in a road network, for a group of users intending to travel collectively. The goal of each problem is to minimize the aggregate cost of the individual travelers' paths and the shared route under various constraints. First, we formulate the problem of determining the optimal pair of end-stops, given a set of queries that originate and terminate near the two prospective end regions. We <b>outline</b> a <b>baseline</b> polynomial-time algorithm and propose a new faster solution - both calculating an exact answer. In our approach, we utilize the path-coherence property of road networks to develop an efficient algorithm. Second, we define the problem of calculating the optimal route and intermediate stops of a vehicle that picks up and drops off passengers en-route, given its start and end stoppages, and a set of path queries from users. We outline an exact solution of both time and space complexities exponential in the number of queries. Then, we propose a novel polynomial-time-and-space heuristic algorithm that performs reasonably well in practice. We also analyze several variants of this problem under different constraints.

This baseline data would provide the opportunity to assess the impacts of management change, and to also initiate a process of long-term socio-economic monitoring. Such monitoring would allow ongoing assessment of the current ‘health’ of the fishery and on-going fishery viability. This report (Part C) <b>outlines</b> the <b>baseline</b> data for Queensland east coast saltwater recreational fishers. For the recreational fishery {{the distinction between the}} Inshore, Rocky Reef and remaining fisheries was not possible given the overlap in recreationally fished species between inshore and offshore habitats. Results focussed on Inshore and Rocky Reef Fisheries where possible. Baseline data were collected via fisher surveys in 2008 plus collation of existing data from other sources, prior to implementation of the new Inshore Fishery Management Plan. The baseline data also provide a test of many of the socio-economic indicators listed by fishery stakeholders in a workshop prior to the surveys. A brief summary of the most pertinent findings are provided here. Results of this study highlight the social and economic importance of saltwater recreational fisheries to coastal communities in Queensland. Saltwater fisheries in particular provide a range of recreational opportunities to Queensland residents from a range of socio-economic backgrounds, with a significant number of people participating in the fishery each year, many who rate fishing among their top outdoor recreation activities. Further, most fishing occurs in inshore habitats, highlighting the importance of the Inshore Fishery. The number of people who participate in recreational fishing each year in Queensland has been declining since 1996 (McInnes 2006) and results here suggest this decline is continuing. The high average age of saltwater recreational fishers, combined with the small proportion of the fisher population identified as being “new” fishers suggests that declining participation in the Inshore Fishery may continue to be an issue in the future. Continued monitoring of fishing participation rates and {{a better understanding of the}} factors that influence recreational fishing participation patterns should be a priority for this fishery. Fishers surveyed in this study reported being generally satisfied with most of the aspects of saltwater fishing they were questioned about, although a substantial proportion reported declining fishing quality and fishing satisfaction over the past 5 years. This decline was related to fishers’ perceptions about access to resources, quality of fishing-related facilities, number of fish caught, and crowding in areas where they fish. If perceptions of fishing quality and satisfaction continue to decline, it is likely that some fishers will seek fishing experiences elsewhere, or will cease fishing in favour of other activities (Ditton and Sutton 2004; Gentner and Sutton 2008). There was substantial support for recreational fisheries management among saltwater fishers in Queensland. In general, most fishers believed that conservation of fish populations was a high priority for fisheries management, and most believed that strict recreational fishing regulations are necessary to meet conservation goals. Most fishers also expressed support for the specific recreational fishing regulations in place at the time of the survey, including size, bag, and possession limits, closed seasons, closed areas, and no-take species. Continued monitoring of fishers’ knowledge and attitudes regarding management of the Inshore Fishery will be important, particularly after new management changes have been implemented. Awareness of the proposed changes to the Inshore Fishery was low among recreational fishers, with only about half of surveyed fishers being aware there was a new plan being developed, and only about 30...|$|R

In this paper, the product of a joint DPLA–Europeana Rights Statements Working Group, we recommend a series of Rights Statements that are simple, flexible and descriptive. We propose ten Rights Statements that the DPLA and Europeana partners can implement to communicate to users the copyright and related restrictions on use of Items in their collections. We propose to host these statements at rightsstatements. org, allowing each Item to which they are applied to be linked to the definitive explanation of its terms. The Rights Statements we recommend need to be understood by both machines and humans, making the concepts around copyright and related rights clear and understandable to all. By doing that, we can educate and encourage people to use cultural heritage material to the fullest extent possible while respecting copyright and related restrictions on reuse. The recommendations outlined in this document support a framework that promotes appropriate use of collections held by cultural heritage institutions through openness, accuracy, simplicity and clarity. The simple, flexible framework advocates for the uniform description of baseline copyright status information that is easily translatable for people and machines. This group intends that this document be a call to action for institutions to implement these statements locally and to begin the work of educating their users and enhancing their abilities to reuse Works in their collections more broadly.

40|$|Os universitários são expostos a uma diversidade de situações sociais que repetidas vezes são enfrentadas com dificuldade e tentativas de esquiva, o que constitui fator de risco para a fobia social. Fobia social tem sido considerada um grave problema de saúde mental em função das incapacidades no desempenho em situações socias. A presente pesquisa tem por objetivo avaliar os efeitos de um procedimento de intervenção comportamental que inclui treino de habilidades sociais para universitários com fobia social. Foi utilizado um delineamento de linha de base múltipla com quatro universitários, sendo dois homens e duas mulheres, na faixa etária entre 19 e 31 anos, com diagnóstico de fobia social, sem comerbidades, obtido a partir da Entrevista Clínica Estruturada para o DSM-IV (SCID-I). Três universitários passaram pelo processo de intervenção e um respondeu apenas aos instrumentos, em diferentes momentos da pesquisa. As habilidades sociais e o diagnóstico do transtorno dos participantes foram avaliados antes da intervenção, após, e em seguimento, quatro meses depois, com a aplicação da SCID-I, do Mini-Inventário de Fobia Social (Mini-SPIN), do Questionário de Avaliação de Comportamento e Contextos de Vida para Estudantes Universitários (Q-ACC-VU) e do Inventário de Habilidades Sociais (IHS), instrumentos que avaliaram as medidas de produto. As medidas de processo, avaliadas a cada sessão, foram obtidas com a aplicação de uma lista de Verificação de comportamentos (checklist), Questões de Avaliação do Desempenho e Tarefas de Casa. O delineamento adotado foi o de linha de base multipla com sujeito único. A intervenção foi realizada no Centro de Psicologia Aplicada de uma universidade pública, contou com 12 encontros semanais com duas horas de duração conduzidos pela própria pesquisadora. Os resultados [...] .. The {{university}} students {{are exposed to}} a diversity of social situations that for frequent times ara confronted with difficulty and attempts of shunning, which constitute factor of risk to the social phobia. Social Phobia has been considered a serious mental health problem {{as a function of}} the disabilities in the development in social situations. The present research has as a goal to evaluate the effects of a behavioral intervention procedure which includes practice os social skills to {{university students}} with social phobia. An <b>outline</b> of multiple <b>baseline</b> was used with four university students, whose two men and two women, 19 and 31 year-old age group, diagnosed as social phobia, with no diseases, obtained from the Structured Clinical Interview to the DSM-IV (SCID-I). There univesitystudents went through the intervention process and one of them answered only to the instruments, in different moments of the research. The social skills and the diagnosis of the diasease of the participants were evaluated before the intervention, after, and in the sequence, four months later, with teh application of the SCID-I, of the Social Phobia Mini-Inventory (Mini-SPIN), of the Survey of Evaluation of Behaviors and Contexts of Life to University Students (Q-ACC-VU) and of the Inventory of Social Skills (IHS), instruments that evaluated the measurements of product. The measurements of process, evaluated in every section, were obtained with the application of a Behavior Checklist. Questions of Development and Homework Evaluation. The adopted outline was the one of a multiple base line with an only character. The intervention was held at Centro de Psicologia Aplicada in a public university, there were 12 weekly meetings for two hours each guided by the researcher herself. The results showed that the participants [...] . (Complete abstract click electronic access below...|$|R

Biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories, 5 th ed. Atlanta, GA: CDC; 2009. HHS publication no. [CDC] 21 - 1112. Available at [URL] The U. S. Department of Agriculture Guidelines for Avian Influenza Viruses {{builds on the}} BMBL manual and provides additional biosafety and biocontainment guidelines for laboratories working with HPAI (US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Agricultural Select Agent Program. Guidelines for avian influenza viruses. Washington, DC: US Department of Agriculture; 2011. Available at [URL]). The recommendations in this report, which are intended for laboratories in the United States, <b>outline</b> the essential <b>baseline</b> biosafety measures for working with the subset of influenza viruses that contain a hemagglutinin (HA) from the HPAI influenza A/goose/Guangdong/ 1 / 96 lineage, including reassortant influenza viruses created in a laboratory setting. All H 5 N 1 influenza virus clades known to infect humans to date have been derived from this lineage (WHO/OIE/FAO H 5 N 1 Evolution Working Group. Continued evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza A [H 5 N 1]: updated nomenclature. Influenza Other Respir Viruses 2012; 6 : 1 - 5). In 2009, the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules were amended to include specific biosafety and biocontainment recommendations for laboratories working with Recombinant Risk Group 3 influenza viruses, including HPAI H 5 N 1 influenza viruses within the Goose/Guangdong/ 1 / 96 -like H 5 lineage. In February 2013, the NIH guidelines were further revised to provide additional biosafety containment enhancements and practices for research with HPAI H 5 N 1 viruses that are transmissible among mammals by respiratory droplets (i. e., mammalian-transmissible HPAI H 5 N 1) (National Institutes of Health, Office of Biotechnology Activities. NIH guidelines for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Appendix G-II-C- 5 : biosafety level 3 enhanced for research involving risk group 3 influenza viruses. Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health; 2013. Available at [URL]). The recent revisions to the NIH guidelines focus on a smaller subset of viruses but are applicable and consistent with the recommendations in this report. The biosafety recommendations in this report were developed by CDC with advice from the Intragovernmental Select Agents and Toxins Technical Advisory Committee, which is a panel composed of federal government subject-matter experts, and from public input received {{in response to the}} request for information that was published in the Federal Register on October 17, 2012 (US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC. Influenza viruses containing the hemagglutinin from the Goose/ Guangdong/ 1 / 96 lineage; proposed rule; request for information and comment. 42 CFR, Part 73. Federal Register 2012; 77 : 63783 - 5). Work with HPAI H 5 N 1 virus should be conducted, at a minimum, at biosafety level 3 (BSL- 3), with specific enhancements to protect workers, the public, animal health, and animal products. Original clinical specimens suspected of containing viruses of this lineage can only be handled at BSL- 2 if the procedures do not involve the propagation of the virus. An appropriate biosafety level should be determined in accordance with a biosafety risk assessment. Additional information on performing biosafety risk assessments and establishing effective biosafety containment is available in the BMBL manual.
