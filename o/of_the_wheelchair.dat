500|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Events with [...] "B" [...] in the code are for athletes with visual impairment, codes LW1 to LW9 are for athletes who stand to compete and LW10 to LW12 are for athletes who compete sitting down. For the 2006 Paralympics alpine skiing events grouped athletes in to sitting, standing and visually impaired. Wheelchair curling, making its first appearance at the Games in 2006, was open to athletes with a physical disability in {{the lower part of the}} body that required the everyday use of a wheelchair. Stones may be played by hand while leaning over the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair,</b> or pushed by a delivery stick.|$|E

2500|$|The {{company was}} awarded its first {{contract}} in November 1994, when the Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority, of Dayton, Ohio placed {{an order for}} 63 two-axle trolleybuses. The order was later reduced to 61 vehicles, and ultimately to 57. Three prototype trolleybuses were delivered in December 1995 and January 1996. These were designated by ETI as model 14TrE, the E standing for [...] "export", and were given fleet numbers 9601-9603 by MVRTA. Following modifications to the design, construction of the 54 production-series ETI trolleybuses for Dayton took place in 1998-99. These were model 14TrE2 and were numbered 9801-9854 in MVRTA's fleet. Among the modifications were the moving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> lift from the rear door to the front door, which necessitated widening the body from [...] to [...] and changing from a one-piece windshield to a two-piece one.|$|E
2500|$|At one Canadian service, {{hidden cameras}} showed {{a mother who}} was {{carrying}} her muscular dystrophy-afflicted daughter, Grace, being stopped by two screeners when they attempted {{to get into the}} line for a possible blessing from Hinn. The screeners asked the mother if Grace had been healed, and when the mother replied in the negative, they were told to return to their seats; the pair got out of line, but Grace, wanting [...] "Pastor Benny to pray for ," [...] asked her mother to support her as she tried to walk as a show of [...] "her faith in action," [...] according to the mother. After several unsuccessful attempts at walking, the pair left the arena in tears, both mother and daughter visibly upset at being turned aside and crying as they explained to the undercover reporters that all Grace had wanted was for Hinn to pray for her, but the staffers rushed them out of the line when they found out Grace had not been healed. A week later at a service in Toronto, Baptist evangelist Justin Peters, who wrote his Masters in Divinity thesis on Benny Hinn and has attended numerous Hinn crusades since 2000 as part of his research for his thesis and for a seminar he developed about the Word of Faith movement entitled A Call for Discernment, also demonstrated to the hidden cameras that [...] "people who look like me"—Peters has cerebral palsy, walks with arm-crutches, and is obviously and visibly disabled—"are never allowed on stage [...] it's always somebody who has some disability or disease that cannot be readily seen." [...] Like Grace and her mother, Peters was quickly intercepted as he came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> section (there is one at every crusade, situated {{at the back of the}} audience, far away from the stage, and never filmed for Hinn's TV show) in an attempt to join the line of those waiting to go onstage, and was told to take a seat.|$|E

30|$|In this study, a novel step {{climbing}} {{method for}} a five-wheeled wheelchair, {{composed of a}} manual wheelchair and an active-caster drive system, has been proposed. Because the active-caster has the same configuration as a passive caster, an arbitrary velocity can be generated by controlling its wheel and steering shafts. Thus, <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>wheelchair</b> can be controlled in 2 DOF (two degrees <b>of</b> freedom) despite <b>the</b> single-wheel drive system. Moreover, by changing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> points <b>of</b> contact between <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> and <b>the</b> ground using a linear actuator, two types of motion can be accomplished, similar to front and rear drive modes.|$|R
