5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects <b>on</b> <b>even</b> heavily infested animals.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled <b>on</b> (<b>even</b> by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
5|$|Color schemes {{included}} light gray, haze gray, ocean gray, and black. Haze gray {{was found}} to provide reasonable protection in the widest range of conditions, and became a standard US Navy paint scheme after World War II. Ocean gray also became a standard paint scheme after the war. Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships <b>on</b> <b>even</b> the darkest nights.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944, the {{situation}} on all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks <b>on</b> <b>even</b> larger Axis garrisons. In a surprise attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 unserviceable aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.|$|E
5|$|Normal time {{ended with}} the game at 2–2. The ensuing periods of extra time saw {{defensive}} football from both sides; Celtic was down to ten men when Bobo Balde was dismissed on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes, Derlei reacted quickest to a Robert Douglas block and rounded McNamara make it 3–2 for Porto. Porto managed to hang <b>on</b> <b>even</b> after having Nuno Valente sent off just {{before the end of}} extra-time, thus ensuring that Porto had ended their 16-year wait between European trophies. It was Porto's first UEFA Cup win, and they were also the first team to win a trophy on the silver goal rule.|$|E
5|$|Spines, {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present <b>on</b> <b>even</b> those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near {{the surface of the}} cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of simpler model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments <b>on</b> <b>even</b> simpler systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{large and}} {{damaging}} tsunami that was generated {{was out of}} proportion relative {{to the size of}} the event, based on its short-period body wave magnitude. The Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency assigned a magnitude of 6.8, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a similar value of 6.1 (both body wave magnitude) that were calculated from short-period seismic waves (1–2 seconds in the case of the USGS). The USGS then presented a moment magnitude of 7.2 that was calculated from 5–100-second surface waves, and Harvard University subsequently revealed that a moment magnitude of 7.7 had been resolved based <b>on</b> <b>even</b> longer 150-second surface waves.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly <b>on</b> <b>even</b> surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E
