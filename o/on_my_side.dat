500|$|In Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, Egypt {{is covered}} only in passing. When Eusebius {{remarks on the}} region, however, he writes of tens, twenties, even {{hundreds}} of Christians put to death on a single day, which would seem to make Egypt the region that suffered the most during the persecutions. According to one report that Barnes calls [...] "plausible, if unverifiable", 660 Christians were killed in Alexandria alone between 303 and 311. In Egypt, Peter of Alexandria fled his namesake city {{early on in the}} persecution, leaving the Church leaderless. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis (Asyut), took up the job in his place. Meletius performed ordinations without Peter's permission, which caused some bishops to complain to Peter. Meletius soon refused to treat Peter as any kind of authority, and expanded his operations into Alexandria. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the Church split into two sections: the [...] "Catholic Church", under Peter, and, after Peter's execution, Alexander; and the [...] "Church of the Martyrs" [...] under Meletius. When the two groups found themselves imprisoned together in Alexandria during the persecution, Peter of Alexandria drew up a curtain {{in the middle of their}} cell. He then said: [...] "There are some who are of my view, let them come over <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> and those of Melitius's view, stay with Melitius." [...] Thus divided, the two sects went on with their affairs, purposely ignoring each other's existence. The schism continued to grow throughout the persecution, even with its leaders in jail, and would persist long after the deaths of both Peter and Meletius. Fifty-one bishoprics are attested for Egypt in 325; fifteen are only known otherwise as seats of the schismatic Church.|$|E
