One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E

500|$|Scheduled for a January 2008 release, Popular was {{promoted}} with {{five months of}} concert performances by Hunt, press coverage, {{and the release of}} promotional copies, including the four-song EP The Popular Machine (2007) and advance CDs for the media and radio people. However, weeks before its scheduled release, the album was shelved by Blue Note, with whom Hunt had been experiencing differences, and they subsequently parted ways. Blue Note had felt that the album was not profitable enough to release. Hunt could not release Popular himself without repaying the project's costs back to EMI and obtaining rights to the album's master recordings. According to him, EMI requested twice the original costs, and in his opinion, the money for promoting Popular was not [...] "strategically spent well" [...] by the label. Hunt discussed the situation in an interview for Creative Loafing, saying that [...] "They opted to not sell it to me at a price that I could afford. They've got it and I'm sure they'll come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> when they deem it necessary and profitable." [...] Of his decision to relocate to Los Angeles, he later quipped, [...] "Here I am, and the relationship has done much better than the career." ...|$|E

500|$|Mitchell and Webb's {{next project}} came in 2003, with {{starring}} {{roles in the}} Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy Usbourne respectively. The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC; they had an old script {{that they wanted to}} revive and Mitchell and Webb helped <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> eventually evolving into Peep Show. Despite low viewing figures (which almost got the show cancelled after series three) the show was received to wide critical acclaim. The British Sitcom Guide called it [...] "without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade." [...] Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying [...] "the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, which I thought was the best sitcom since Father Ted". The BBC hailed Mitchell's performance in the series, citing that [...] "As Mark Corrigan, David reached out to all those middle-aged men in a twentysomething's body, who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all." [...] Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he [...] "agrees with many of [...] opinions." [...] Peep Show has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.|$|E
500|$|Soviet Strike {{received}} criticism {{regarding the}} player's limited {{view of his}} surroundings and attacks from enemies <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> To offset this potential problem, the developers added a radar to the HUD, which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player. Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike. A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series, the team {{did not wish to}} alienate long-term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier, but instead more accessible, using such devices as the new radar, a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and [...] "a lot more visual and audible clues". Producer Kosaka explained: [...] "A lot of the stuff we couldn't fit in [...] is going in this one". The team added several new vehicles, as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike. The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed, but appeared in the final game. Heat-seeking missiles were among other new additions, as was a proprietary technology termed the Interactive Music System. This generates more [...] "pulse pounding" [...] music depending on the level of action occurring in-game. Palomar Studios created the full motion video, for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave, used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman. This latter shoot also employed a live tiger.|$|E

2500|$|French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who {{had once}} called for the Louvre to be [...] "burnt down", came under {{suspicion}} and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated. Two years later the thief revealed himself. Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia had stolen the Mona Lisa by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> hidden under his coat after the museum had closed. Peruggia was an Italian patriot who believed Leonardo's painting should have been returned for display in an Italian museum.|$|E
2500|$|When {{considering}} {{these large}} objects, we might {{also want to}} see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. [...] It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object [...] "one greater than infinity" [...] exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started <b>out</b> <b>with.</b> <b>It</b> is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.|$|E
2500|$|To {{protect against}} defilement from {{contact with the}} dead, they built courtyards over bedrock, and left beneath them a hollow to serve as {{protection}} against a grave in the depths. They used to bring pregnant women there to give birth and rear their children in this ritually pure place. They placed doors {{on the backs of}} oxen and placed the children upon them with stone cups in their hands. When the children reached the pool of Siloam, the children stepped down, filled the cups with water, and then climbed back up on the doors. Rabbi Jose said that each child used to let down his cup and fill it from on top of the oxen. When the children arrived at the Temple Mount with the water, they got down. Beneath the Temple Mount and the Temple courtyards was a hollow, which protected against contamination from a grave in the depths. At the entrance of the court of the women, they kept a jar of the ashes of the sin-offerings. If they did not find the residue of the ashes of seven Red Cows, they performed the sprinkling with those of six, of five, of four, of three, of two or of one. They made a causeway from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, arches above arches, each arch placed directly above each pier of the arch below, as a protection against a grave in the depths, on which the priest who was to burn the cow, the cow itself, and all who aided in its preparation went forth to the Mount of Olives. If the cow refused to go out, they did not take <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> a black cow, lest it be said that they killed a black cow instead of a Red Cow. Nor did they bring out another Red Cow, lest it be said that they killed two Red Cows. But Rabbi Jose said it was not for this reason, but because [...] says, [...] "And he shall bring her forth," [...] implying: by herself.|$|E
