5000|$|His {{government}} of the abbey was marked by regard for strict discipline tempered with generosity. Thus, while he deposed John Langton, Prior of Tynemouth, for disobedience to his ‘Visitors’, he gave letters testimonial for the absolution of a priest who, by misadventure, had committed homicide.

5|$|In the October 1917 elections, the Social Democrats {{lost their}} {{absolute}} majority, which radicalized {{the labor movement}} and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with political development based on the commoners' interpretation of the ideas of Fennomania and socialism, the events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The date of Paston’s letter {{suggests}} {{the marriage was}} still being negotiated in February 1472.

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E

However, this new <b>order</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> international recognition and the war continued.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike croquet, both balls must be {{staked out}} in the same turn in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> {{outright}} <b>win</b> the game.

Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively [...] "stake-out" [...] an opponent's rover in roque.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E

She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|Between the wars, Krueger {{served in}} a number of command and staff positions, and {{attended}} the Naval War College at his own request. In 1941, he assumed command of the Third Army, which he led in the Louisiana Maneuvers. He expected, in view of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of victorious campaigns against the Japanese. As an army commander, Krueger had to grapple with the problems imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He had to balance MacArthur's need to speed up the tempo of operations in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> campaigns with the more cautious approach of subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In the Battle of Luzon in 1945, his largest, longest and last battle, he was finally able to maneuver his army as he had in 1941 against a Japanese army under Tomoyuki Yamashita.|$|E

Historically, students had been a key voting bloc for the PQ.|$|R
