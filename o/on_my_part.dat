500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder," [...] a protest widely interpreted as in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests have generated mixed reactions, and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.|$|E

500|$|Philip K.

He added, [...] "That insistence <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>part</b> of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization– they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles." [...] Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was eventually reprinted as a tie-in, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title. Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled Blade Runner: A Story of the Future by Les Martin was released in 1982. Archie Goodwin scripted the comic book adaptation, , published in September 1982.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World had divided music critics, with Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone lauding it as [...] "a pop {{religious}} {{ceremony for}} all seasons" [...] and [...] "an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance", while the NMEs reviewer derided the pious {{nature of the}} songs and concluded: [...] "So damn holy I could scream." [...] Although the album was another [...] "massive" [...] commercial success for Harrison, and the general perception remained {{that he was still}} the most capable of the four ex-Beatles, Harrison was reportedly stung by this criticism of the overt Vaishnava Hindu spirituality in his music. His purchase of Bhaktivedanta Manor early that year as a UK headquarters for ISKCON – or, colloquially, [...] "the Hare Krishna movement" [...] – led to ridicule in the British press. Author Joshua Greene, a former ISKCON devotee, describes a visit Harrison made to the house in August 1973 when the singer shared his concerns with Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the movement's international leader: [...] "I'm provoking a bad reaction," [...] Harrison confided. [...] "The stronger the commitment <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> the stronger the animosity becomes." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I have spoken to Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>part,</b> he knows {{what he has to do}} and what he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him. I hope Italy win although the favourites are other teams such as Germany, Spain and France." ...|$|E
