40|$|A <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> is a {{collection}} of DNA fragments cloned into vectors and stored individually in host cells, and is a valuable resource for molecular cloning, gene physical mapping, and genome sequencing projects. To take the best advantage of a <b>DNA</b> <b>library,</b> a good screening method is needed. After describing pooling strategies and issues that should be considered in <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> screening, here we report an efficient colony multiplex quantitative PCR-based 3 -step, 3 -dimension, and binary-code (3 S 3 DBC) method we used to screen genes from a planarian genomic <b>DNA</b> fosmid <b>library.</b> This method requires only 3 rounds of PCR reactions and only around 6 hours to distinguish one or more desired clones from a large <b>DNA</b> <b>library.</b> According to the particular situations in different research labs, this method can be further modified and simplified to suit their requirements...|$|R
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of an mRNA display library starts from the {{synthesis of}} a <b>DNA</b> <b>library.</b> A <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> for any protein or small peptide of interest can be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis followed by PCR amplification. Usually, each member of this <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> has a T7 RNA polymerase transcription site and a ribosomal binding site at the 5’ end. The T7 promoter region allows large-scale in vitro T7 transcription to transcribe the <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> into an mRNA library, which provides templates for the in vitro translation reaction later. The ribosomal binding site in the 5’-untranslated region (5’ UTR) is designed according to the in vitro translation system to be used. There are two popular commercially available in vitro translation systems. One is E. Coli S30 Extract System (Promega) that requires a Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 5’ UTR as a ribosomal binding site; {{the other one is}} Red Nova Lysate (Novagen), which needs a ΔTMV ribosomal binding site.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} in vitro {{selection}} {{has led to}} the discovery of many aptamers with potential to be developed into inhibitors and biosensors, but problems in isolating aptamers against certain targets with desired affinity and specificity still remain. One possible improvement is to use libraries enhanced for motifs repeatedly isolated in aptamer molecules. One such frequently observed motif is the two-tiered guanine quadruplex. In this study we investigated whether <b>DNA</b> <b>libraries</b> could be designed to contain a large fraction of molecules capable of folding into two-tiered guanine quadruplexes. Using comprehensive circular dichroism analysis, we found that <b>DNA</b> <b>libraries</b> could be designed to contain a large proportion of sequences that adopt guanine quadruplex structures. Analysis of individual sequences from a small library revealed a mixture of quadruplexes of different topologies providing the diversity desired for an in vitro selection. We also found that primer-binding sites are detrimental to quadruplex formation and devised a method for post-selection amplification of primer-less quadruplex libraries. With the development of guanine quadruplex enriched <b>DNA</b> <b>libraries,</b> {{it should be possible to}} improve the chances of isolating aptamers that utilize a quadruplex scaffold and enhance the success of in vitro selectio...|$|R
50|$|Strand-seq (single strand sequencing) {{was first}} {{described}} in 2012 as {{a technique to}} isolate sequenced reads from parental template strands in single-cell <b>DNA</b> <b>libraries.</b> As a proof of concept study, the authors demonstrated the ability to acquire sequence information from the Watson and/or Crick chromosomal strands in an individual <b>DNA</b> <b>library,</b> depending on the mode of chromatid segregation; a typical <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> will always contain DNA from both strands. The authors were specifically interested in showing the utility of strand-seq in detecting sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) at high-resolution. They successfully identified eight putative SCEs in the murine (mouse) embryonic stem (meS) cell line with resolution up to 23 bp. This methodology {{has also been shown}} to hold great utility in discerning patterns of non-random chromatid segregation, especially in stem cell lineages. Furthermore, SCEs have been implicated as diagnostic indicators of genome stress, information that has utility in cancer biology. Most research on this topic involves observing the assortment of chromosomal template strands through many cell development cycles and correlating non-random assortment with particular cell fates. Single-cell sequencing protocols were foundational in the development of this technique, but they differ in several aspects.|$|R

40|$|Pooling {{design is}} a very helpful tool for {{reducing}} the number of tests in <b>DNA</b> <b>library</b> screening, which is a key process to obtain high-quality <b>DNA</b> <b>libraries</b> for studying gene functions. Three basic problems in pooling design are, given an m n binary matrix and a positive integer d, to decide whether the matrix is d-separable (d-separable, or d-disjunct). The three problems are all known to be coNP-complete. Since in most applications, d is a small integer compared to n, it is interesting to investigate whether there are efficient algorithms solving the above problems when the value of d is small. In this article, we give a negative answer to the above question by studying the parameterized complexity of these three problems, with d as the parameter. We show that the parameterized versions of all the three problems are co-W[2]-complete. An immediate implication of our results is that, given an m n binary matrix and a positive integer d, a deterministic algorithm with running time f(d) (mn) O(1) (where f is an arbitrary computable function) to decide whether the matrix is d-separable (d-separable, or d-disjunct) should not be expected.
