5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is on the album.|$|E
500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> we'd have done enough." ...|$|E
500|$|During the documentary, [...] "What Happens in Vegas...", Beyoncé {{stated that}} when {{the idea of a}} Vegas show was {{presented}} to her, she wanted the show to be a complete 180 from her current tour. Also, she did not want it to be the typical Las Vegas showcase. She wanted to remove the theatrics and [...] "consciously show that I don't need any <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> Just give me my band, a stage and some cool smoke and lights." [...] Beyoncé and her production quickly organized the show in seven days, based on a script provided by filmmaker Matthew Dickens. She often rehearsed during sound checks of her 2009 tour.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert soon {{realised}} that {{it would}} be difficult to design the game by himself; he decided to join forces with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, both of whom he hired for Lucasfilm. The game's insult sword fighting mechanics were influenced by swashbuckling movies starring Errol Flynn, which Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman often watched for inspiration. They noticed that pirates in those films often taunted their opponents instead of attacking them, which gave the designers the idea to base the game's duels on insults rather than combat. Writer Orson Scott Card helped them write the insults during a visit to Lucasfilm's headquarters at Skywalker Ranch. Many of Gilbert's original gameplay ideas were abandoned during the production process, although he stated that [...] "most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> was left out for a reason".|$|E
500|$|Since 1952, the News-Miner has {{featured}} a small cartoon figure named Sourdough Jack {{at the bottom}} of its front page. The drawing of Sourdough Jack is always paired with a comment on a news story, pun, or joke, apparently having been spoken by the figure. The idea for Sourdough Jack came from News-Miner editor John J. Ryan, who said, [...] "People had many complaints about the town. ... He could make fun <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> and that would give people a chance to laugh at their problems." [...] Sourdough Jack's name came from Ryan's nickname (Jack) and the traditional nickname given to an old miner (sourdough). [...] Jack Ryan worked for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer later in his life. John Ryan changed his name in the 70's to John O'Ryan.|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|Feige {{felt that}} the visuals of the film needed [...] "to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip", and said that [...] "You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a {{scientist}} went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> is happening! We're not {{going to spend a}} lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E
5000|$|The mall {{opened in}} June 1958. It {{was billed as}} the largest {{shopping}} centre in Western Canada, with about 30 stores and services. As described by mall spokeswoman Paula Newhold: [...] "It was revolutionary to have a mall and to have late-night shopping and all <b>of</b> <b>that</b> kind <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> is just quite normal for us now. The real experience {{was that it was}} all in one place - that was the interesting thing." ...|$|R

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{screenplay}} he further stated, [...] "Mark Stanfield {{is a good}} writer and a Beatles fan who {{has a lot of}} knowledge [...] Some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> was ad-libbed by the actors because they really got into this, but Mark also wrote characters instead of stereotypes or caricatures." ...|$|E

There’s a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that’s</b> in line with Don’t Panic, but there’s a lot <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that’s</b> a logical next step from it, too."—vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth.|$|R

2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Jourgensen parted {{ways with}} George and signed to Sire Records. Jourgensen {{performed}} mostly solo for Ministry's next LP, Twitch (1986), which sold well, {{but was still}} considered to be [...] "underground". The music was danceable electronic music, but was not pop music, and the sound was harsher and more aggressive than what Ministry had recorded before. According to Jourgensen, [...] "Twitch was stuff that I was doing before With Sympathy came out. Some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> was already {{four or five years}} old, but the record company didn't want to use it, so...". Much of the new sound was created with the use of digital sampling and the input of producer Adrian Sherwood.|$|E
2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted all <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> on there. I think half of the tracks were written when we got there, and the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut out {{the rainbow}} <b>of</b> hope and <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> about walkin' {{one by one}} through the narrow isles of Spain," [...] said Mrs. Peters, with a sigh.

2500|$|Rygg {{described}} Shadows of the Sun as [...] "our {{most personal}} record to date." [...] Commenting in Unrestrained magazine in 2007, Rygg said, [...] "I'm a diagnosed depressive, {{and should have}} been trying to focus on living, but instead I've immersed myself in some isolated, dark and paranoid place. It has no doubt helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind." [...] Adding, “Sometimes all I see is darkness; it's overpowering. So this record is about venting out a lot <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> the gloom, but it also represents some kind of quiet acceptance. Like this is how the situation is, and you're just gonna have to live with it. Use it for what it's worth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 2004, {{lead singer}} James Hetfield {{revealed}} that Metallica {{had been playing}} new material during studio sessions, but {{that there was no}} mention of plans for a ninth studio album at that time. Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, [...] "I definitely look forward to sifting through some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> when we get back to the studio in January." [...] On that note, by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
2500|$|By 1977, both Molland and Evans {{were out}} of the music business. Molland later {{described}} his dire economic circumstances: [...] "Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where my wife and I have had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E
