Everything, save the dancing clouds of insect youth which whirled in his face, was drooping in the heat.

5000|$|The Virginia opossum {{is noted}} for {{reacting}} to threats by feigning death. This is {{the genesis of}} the term [...] "playing possum", which means pretending to be dead or injured with intent to deceive. In the case of the opossum, the reaction seems to be involuntary, and to be triggered by extreme fear. It should not be taken as an indication of docility, for under serious threat, an opossum will respond ferociously, hissing, screeching, and showing its teeth, but with enough stimulation, the opossum will enter a near coma. It lies on its side, mouth and eyes <b>open,</b> <b>tongue</b> hanging out, emitting a green fluid from its anus whose putrid odor repels predators. Heart rate drops by half, and breathing rate is slowed by about 30%. Brain activity is unaltered however, and the animal remains fully conscious. Death feigning normally stops when the threat withdraws, and it can last up to six hours. Besides discouraging animals that eat live prey, playing possum also convinces some large animals that the opossum is no threat to their young.|$|E
40|$|In a {{traditional}} pipe organ the pipe ranks {{are composed of}} labial (flue) and lingual (reed) pipes. Both kinds of ranks are tuned and voiced to a nominal windchest pressure. Changing this pressure not only affects {{the volume of the}} radiated sound but both the pitch and the timbre of the pipes. This means a strict limitation to the dynamic range of these pipe ranks. In this contribution a new construction is examined that can possibly have an extended dynamic range: organ pipes with blown open tongues. These pipes have three main parts. From the windchest air is first conveyed into a small pressure tank which functions as the pipe foot. On the inner side of the pressure a blown <b>open</b> <b>tongue</b> is mounted. The other side of the tongue faces the resonator that can have various shapes. Contrary to traditional lingual pipes which have blown closed tongues, the blown <b>open</b> <b>tongue</b> can operate in a very wide range of driving pressures. The paper focuses on experimental investigations and discusses the results of laboratory measurements performed on experimental pipes. In addition, a simplified model of the new construction is established explaining the observed phenomena...|$|E

Thirty-nine patients with severe OSAHS who had multilevel obstruction, failed continuous positive airway pressure therapy, and then underwent ZPPP plus Eco-TBR were enrolled in this study. The subjective symptoms and objective polysomnography parameters were collected pre-operatively and at a minimum of 12 weeks postoperatively. Statistical analysis was determined by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results.

40|$|Aims To {{evaluate}} {{the long term}} results of tongue base reduction with hyoepiglottoplasty as a surgical option {{in the treatment of}} severe obstructive sleep apnea. Material and Method Severe obstructive sleep apnea patients diagnosed as upper airway narrowing at the tongue base level were treated with transcervical tongue base reduction with hyoepiglottoplasty. Seven years after single stage multilevel surgery, the patients were reevaluated clinically, radiologically and polysomnographic records were taken. Preoperative, early postoperative and long-term postoperative parameters were compared to determine the success rate of the surgical technique. Results In the postoperative long-term follow-up Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores were reduced to 4 and 6 respectively 2  months after surgery despite the initial values of 17 and 15. BMI were decreased from 29. 7 and 27. 9  kg/m 2 respectively to 26 and 24  kg/m 2. The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) were reduced to 14. 1 and 16. 2 respectively from 68. 6 and 83. 83. O 2 nadir was 55 and 66 % respectively and improved to 86 and 89 %. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy revealed competent airway in both retropalatal and retroglossal level. Bed partners scored snoring as 2 / 10 and 4 / 10 corresponding to very mild and moderate. Daytime somnolence and witnessed apneic periods were completely disappeared in both patients. Conclusion <b>Open</b> <b>tongue</b> base resection with hyoepiglottoplasty is effective among all other surgical corrections of sleep apnea even after 7  years postoperatively...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Open bite is a multifactorial {{phenomenon}} and no single factor {{can account for}} open-bite. Etiology {{plays an important role}} in diagnosis. Heredity, unfavorable growth patterns, incorrect jaw postoure, are the characteristics of skeletal open bite. Digit sucking. Depending on where the thumb is placed, a number of different types of dental problems can develop. Malocclusions of the late mixed or permanent dentitions, caused by thumb sucking are not self corrected and orthodontic treatment is necessary for their correction. Lymphatic tissue. In order to produce oral respiration, the mandible is postured inferiorly with the tongue protruded and resting against the oral floor. This postural alteration induces dental and skeletal modifications similar to those caused by thumb sucking. This may cause excessive eruption of the posterior teeth, leading to an increase in the vertical dimension of the face and result in development of anterior <b>open</b> bite. <b>Tongue</b> thrust. Tongue habits cause an anterior open bite or they develop secondarily to thumb sucking. In skeletal <b>open</b> bite the <b>tongue</b> habit acts as a secondary factor which helps to maintain or exacerbate the condition. Many orthodontists have had a discouraging experience of completing dental treatment, with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case had relapsed because the patient had a tongue thrust swallowing pattern. Conclusion. Dentoalveolar or habitual open bite is caused by habits, which influence the growth and development of dentoalveolar processes and contribute to occlusal disharmonies. Prior to eruption of adult dentition, open bite related to oral habits is usually not a concern as when the habits stop, because the erupting dentition tends to improve spontaneously. Treatment is usually not necessary until permanent teeth erupt (~ 6 years old). ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTNowadays, {{aesthetic}} {{demands are}} of interest to individuals. Smile is the gateway to human and labor relations, which is why so much importance {{is given to the}} care and dental alignment as well as facial harmony. The class II, Division 1 malocclusion {{is one of the greatest}} causes of facial disharmony generating a negative psychological impact on people and requires longer treatment periods. Etiology is due to a combination of skeletal, dental and extrinsic factors. This case describes the treatment of a 13 -years-old female patient diagnosed with a class II division 1 malocclusion with a 7 mm overjet, <b>open</b> bite, <b>tongue</b> thrust, severe crowding and facial disharmony. Treatment goals were to achieve dental and facial harmony in the shortest time possible. The treatment lasted for 15 months and was based on the extraction of upper and lower first bicuspids and placement of Tip-Edge appliances. A molar and canine Class I relationship was obtained, ideal overjet and overbite were established and cosmetic results were satisfactory and significant for the patient. These changes generate greater emotional security in themselves...|$|R
