60|$|Charley {{had had a}} {{long run}} since we last saw him. After {{describing}} a wide curve, in which his charger displayed a surprising aptitude for picking out the ground that was least covered with snow, he {{headed straight for the}} fort again at the same pace at which he had started. At first Charley tried every possible method to check him, but in vain; so he gave it up, resolving to enjoy the race, since he could not prevent it. The young horse seemed to be made of lightning, with bones and muscles of brass, for he bounded untiringly forward for miles, tossing his head and snorting in his wild career. But Charley was a good horseman, and did not mind that much, being quite satisfied that the horse was a horse, and not a spirit, and that therefore he could not run for ever. At last he approached the party, in search of which he had originally set out. His eyes dilated and his colour heightened as he beheld the wolf running directly towards him. Fumbling hastily for the pistol which he had borrowed from his friend Harry, he drew it from his pocket, and prepared to give the animal a shot in passing. Just at that moment the wolf caught sight of this new enemy in advance, and diverged suddenly to the left, plunging into a drift in his confusion, and so enabling the senior clerk to overtake him, and send an ounce of heavy shot into his side, which turned him over quite dead. The shot, however, had a double effect. At that instant Charley swept past; and his mettlesome steed swerved as it heard the loud report of the gun, thereby almost unhorsing his rider, and causing him unintentionally to discharge the conglomerate of bullets and swan-shot into the flank of Peter Mactavish's horse--fortunately at a distance which rendered the shot equivalent to a dozen very sharp and particularly stinging blows. On receiving this unexpected salute, the astonished charger reared convulsively, and fell back upon his rider, who was thereby buried deep in the snow, not a vestige of him being left, no more than if he had never existed at all. Indeed, for a moment it seemed to be doubtful whether poor Peter did exist or not, until a sudden upheaving of the snow took place, and his dishevelled head appeared, with the eyes and mouth wide <b>open,</b> <b>bearing</b> on them an expression of mingled horror and amazement. Meanwhile the second shot acted like a spur on the young horse, which flew past Mr Kennedy like a whirlwind.|$|E

The first project of the firm was the administrative building of B&B Italia, an Italian furniture company, in Novedrate, Como, Italy. This design featured suspended container and an <b>open</b> <b>bearing</b> structure, with the conduits for heating and water on the exterior painted in bright colors (blue, red and yellow).

50|$|Williams {{returned}} to competitive {{action for the}} first time in four months at the season's first major. As the defending champion the world No. 1 sought to add a seventh Australian Open title to her haul. In the opening round Williams faced off against the highest ranked unseeded player Camila Giorgi. Williams needed just a single break in each set to secure a straight sets victory and advance to the second round. Her opponent in the second round was former doubles world No.1 Hsieh Su-wei. Williams lost just three games and wrapped up her victory in an hour to set up a third round against Russia's Daria Kasatkina. The world No. 1 overwhelmed her young Russian opponent, for the loss of two games, in 44 minutes to reach the second week of the tournament. Serena would continue her dominant form by dispatching Margarita Gasparyan in a rematch of their 2015 first round Wimbledon encounter. Just as in their previous match, Serena served first and was broken but she responded by reeling in the next four games before breaking for a third time in the eighth game to take the first set. She then won the second set with the drop of one game. In the quarterfinals, Serena faced her long-time rival Maria Sharapova in a rematch of the 2015 Australian Open Final. It was their twenty-first encounter, properly beginning with a very tight first set that began with Serena's slow start. Serena quickly regrouped and managed to break Sharapova in the ninth game, needing 5 break points to do so. She served out the first set and then won the first five games of the second set. She then closed out the match after Maria avoided the bagel with her last service game. Serena faced Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. Serena bagelled her in the first set in 21 minutes with only four unforced errors. The second set was tighter with Serena being broken when serving at 3-2. Serena managed to break back in the ninth game and serve out the match. Serena faced Angelique Kerber in her 26th Grand Slam final as the overwhelming favorite in her efforts to match the Open Era record in Grand Slams, but Serena was defeated in three close sets, her first defeat in the finals of the Australian Open, her first defeat in a three-set Grand Slam Final, and her first defeat in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 U.S. <b>Open.</b> <b>Bearing</b> the weight of history on her shoulders, Serena failed to display the dominant form that helped her reach the final without dropping a set. The match featured Serena committing 46 unforced errors when she has averaged as 20 unforced errors before the final. Throughout the tournament, Serena displayed confident net skills that she lacked in 2015, but they proved to be part of her downfall as she won less than 50% of her points at the net.|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 183 Pumps are an {{essential}} component of most industrial processes. Reliability is a major concern of pump manufacturers and users, since unexpected shutdowns can have serious and costly implications, including loss of production. Pump manufacturers strive to build rugged and durable equipment. Improvements in design and technology are recognized as major contributors to enhance reliability. Metallurgical analysis {{plays an important role in}} this effort, because it provides insight into the actors that are critical to pump performance and longevity. Pumps, in common with other types of rotating machinery, will experience gradual degradation of critical components. Clearances will <b>open,</b> <b>bearings</b> will wear, and performance will gradually be reduced, so that it eventually becomes necessary to disassemble and overhaul the pump. This type of maintenance is expected and predictable. With proper planning, it can be handled with minimal impact on production schedules. High performance machines, however, also experience sudden and unexpected failures either during test or in service unless they are so over designed as to be noncompetitive. These failures provide a very valuable, albeit costly, source of engineering information. Sharing this information benefits the entire pump community, in that is contributes to improved designs, materials selection, quality control, and service engineering. Most importantly, the knowledge gained will prevent additional failures and improve reliability...|$|R

It is dominant on some grasslands of California, and it was probably an abundant native grass before the habitat was altered by invasive non-native grasses. It occurs on serpentine soils with associates such as serpentine reedgrass (Calamagrostis ophitidis). It is also known from parts of South America. It is an annual grass producing one stem or a clump of several stems growing up to 75 centimeters tall.
