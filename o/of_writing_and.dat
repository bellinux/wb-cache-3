5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> giving kvitelach began. This practice is {{not mentioned in}} the writings of the early kabbalists, nor in the works of the school of Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the father of modern Kabbalah. The first time it is mentioned is {{during the time of the}} Baal Shem Tov (1698–1762), founder of Hasidism.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed {{after leaving the}} Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made a full recovery after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After several months <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E

5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> knowledge, {{is prone to}} long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|The 'Peaks of Excellence' {{curriculum}} is continuous with the 'Broad-Base Curriculum', with more elaborate programmes {{that cater to}} students’ talent development. For instance, the Young Writers Programme, which is open to students {{who are interested in}} writing, has lessons conducted by various renowned Chinese language essayists in the region to expose and familiarise students to different forms <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>and</b> encourage them to appreciate different forms of written work. Students also have opportunities to attend cultural symposiums, national and international bi-cultural forums, research on contemporary issues, and embark on refined overseas immersions to strengthen their world and cultural views under the Global Classroom Programme.|$|E
5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E

5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Guinan. The task <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only briefly {{at the beginning of}} the episode to allow more screen time for the guest characters. The beat sheet for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.|$|E
5|$|William Whewell pushed Darwin {{to take on}} {{the duties}} of Secretary of the Geological Society. After {{initially}} declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838. Despite the grind <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> editing the Beagle reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and pigeon fanciers. Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates. He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an orangutan in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.|$|E

5|$|At {{this stage}} in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech {{language}} was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana {{was elected president of}} the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper Národní listy. Meanwhile, Bettina had given birth to another daughter, Božena.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, {{he applied}} to the Civil Aeronautics Administration for a {{commercial}} pilot's licence. He was subsequently certified to fly both single and multi-engine aircraft between 225 and 1500 horsepower. Before being discharged from the Army Air Force in July 1945, he began to fly for Pan American World Airways. He was based first in Miami, before moving to New York City for their long-haul flights. He began to fly routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. He and his wife Eileen lived in River Edge, New Jersey. He continued to pursue his dream <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>and</b> had a poem published in the Op-Ed section of the New York Times on June 17, 1943. During his time with the airline, he took two extension courses at Columbia University {{in the spring of}} 1946.|$|E
5|$|Joss Whedon {{had wanted}} to make a musical episode {{since the start of the}} series. This was {{heightened}} during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of Buffy, he was unable to take more than two weeks off at a time, and the constraints <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.|$|E

5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> (<b>and</b> thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E

25|$|As {{was done}} with Chinese characters, Japanese Buddhist {{scholars}} sometimes created multiple characters with the same phonological value to add meaning to Siddhaṃ characters. This practice, in effect, represents a 'blend' of the Chinese style <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> the Indian style <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> allows Sanskrit texts in Siddhaṃ to be differentially interpreted as they are read, as {{was done with}} Chinese characters that the Japanese had adopted.

Conducting this study, {{the writer is}} curious {{to know about the}} kinds of simple present tense errors produced by students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V <b>of</b> English Department, Petra Christian University in their writing. The writer also wants to know the most frequent type of error produced by students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V is. Besides, the writer also wants to compare the errors produced by students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V. Here, the writer investigates the similarities and or differences of simple present tense errors made by the students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V. Thus, this study is supported by the theories of errors, simple present tense, and error analysis. The writer uses the theories of errors by Dulay, Burt, and Krashen, Littlewood, and Corder, the writer also uses the theories of simple present tense by Murcia and Freeman and Schramper, and the theories on error analysis by Dulay, Burt, and Krashen, and Ellis. Moreover, the study uses qualitative approach in collecting and analyzing the data. Finally, the writer finds out that both <b>of</b> the <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V students of English Department, Petra Christian University produced omission, addition, misformation, and haphazard substitution errors in simple present tense. The writer also finds that the most frequent type of error produced by students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V is the same, that is, omission error. Meanwhile, the difference of the errors produced by the students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I <b>and</b> V is that the writer does not find any misordering error produced by writing V students while there is one misordering error produced by the student <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I. Last <b>of</b> all, the writer finds out that the students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> I produce more variant types of errors than the students <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> V.
