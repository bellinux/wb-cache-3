5|$|Escaping Monarch {{during a}} time stutter, Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, {{students}} apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.|$|E
5|$|Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an {{important}} iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by {{the morning of}} 16 March, operating under standard emergency preparedness procedure. Overall, nearly 40 ships in the port were relocated from the port <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the storm. The Port of Dampier was also closed. The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, {{with little or no}} damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore prices up for a time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting for nearly all of the monetary losses resulting from the storm.|$|E

5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one wanted to try to move it.|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 1997, Mullins and {{his friend}} Mitch McVicker were {{traveling}} southbound on I-39 north of Bloomington, Illinois, to a benefit concert at Wichita State University in Kansas, when they {{lost control of the}} Jeep. They were not wearing seat belts and were both ejected from the vehicle. When a passing semi-trailer truck swerved to miss the overturned Jeep, Mullins, who was too injured to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the oncoming truck, was hit by the truck and instantly died at the scene. McVicker was seriously injured but survived.|$|E
25|$|When the Great Chicago Fire {{broke out}} on October 8, 1871, news of this, {{one of the}} worst conflagrations in U.S. history to ever strike an American city, reached company {{officials}} Henry Willing and Levi Leiter, who decided to load as much of their expensive merchandise as possible onto wagons and take it to Leiter’s home, which was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the fire. The Company’s drivers and teams were ordered out of the barns. Horace B. Parker, a young salesman, rushed to the store’s basement, broke up boxes, and built a fire in the furnace boiler so that the steam-powered elevators could be operated. These employees worked feverishly through the night to remove vital records and valuable goods to safety.|$|E

25|$|The leave is {{sometimes}} considered a cricket shot, {{even though the}} batsman physically does not play at or interfere with the ball as it passes him. The leave {{is likely to be}} used by batsmen during the first few balls they receive, to give themselves time to judge the conditions of the pitch and the bowling before attempting to play a shot. Leaving a delivery is a matter of judgement and technique. The batsman still has to watch the ball closely to ensure that it will not hit him or the wicket; he also has to ensure that his bat and hands are kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the ball so that it cannot make accidental contact and possibly lead to him being out caught. Batsmen only leave the ball when they are certain that it will not hit the stumps.|$|E
500|$|Steph {{appeared}} to [...] "finally [...] happiness" [...] when {{she fell in}} love with Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Although attracted to her, Max initially resisted Steph as he believed her to be a [...] "ditzy, air-headed blonde", only interested in [...] "bad boys." [...] When his younger brother Tom (Ellis Hollins) developed a crush on her, the [...] "kind, sensitive way" [...] Steph handled it altered his impression. Littler explained, [...] "Max begins to realise there's more to her than her looks. He begins to think she's actually really nice and they become friends." [...] Littler quit the series in 2008, and producers planned his exit around Max's wedding to Steph. He was killed off on their wedding day, as he pulled Tom <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a car. Before she filmed the aftermath of Max's death, Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character's bereaved mindset. Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off, and [...] "such an awful thing to happen to Steph", until she received [...] "amazing feedback" [...] about the storyline. In the aftermath, Tom asked Steph to be his mother, in a scene that then-executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year. The interaction between the two was intended to represent [...] "what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart, relationships, friendships, love and loss." [...] Kirkwood praised Stenson's performance throughout the storyline, particularly during in that scene.|$|E
2500|$|Buckley was {{particularly}} concerned about the view that what the CIA and the KGB were doing was morally equivalent. He wrote in his memoirs, [...] "To say that the CIA and the KGB engage in similar practices {{is the equivalent of}} saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a hurtling bus: on the grounds that, after all, in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around.|$|E
