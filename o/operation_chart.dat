40|$|OBJECTIVE: Complications {{have been}} used {{extensively}} to facilitate evaluation of craniosynostosis practice. However, description of complications tends to be nonstandardized, making comparison difficult. The authors propose a new pragmatic classification of complications that relies on prospective data collection, is geared to capture significant morbidity {{as well as any}} “near misses” in a systematic fashion, and {{can be used as a}} quality improvement tool. METHODS: Data on complications for all patients undergoing surgery for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis between 2010 and 2015 were collected from a prospective craniofacial audit database maintained at the authors' institution. Information on comorbidities, details of surgery, and follow-up was extracted from medical records, anesthetic and <b>operation</b> <b>charts,</b> and electronic databases. Complications were defined as any unexpected event that resulted or could have resulted in a temporary or permanent damage to the child. RESULTS: A total of 108 operations for the treatment of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis were performed in 103 patients during the 5 -year study period. Complications were divided into 6 types: 0) perioperative occurrences; 1) inpatient complications; 2) outpatient complications not requiring readmission; 3) complications requiring readmission; 4) unexpected long-term deficit; and 5) mortality. These types were further subdivided according to the length of stay and time after discharge. The overall complication rate was found to be 35. 9 %. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of children with some sort of complication using the proposed definition was much higher than commonly reported, predominantly due to the inclusion of problems often dismissed as minor. The authors believe that these complications should be included in determining complication rates, as they will cause distress to families and may point to potential areas for improving a surgical service...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2003 the Dutch Guidelines for {{treatment}} of inguinal hernia (IH) were published. For treatment of IH in adults, the evidence-based guidelines recommend {{the use of a}} mesh repair technique. In {{order to be able to}} evaluate the effects of these guidelines, a baseline analysis of inguinal hernia surgery before the introduction of these guidelines had to be performed. The second analysis will be performed two years (January-March 2005) after the publication of the Guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To make an inventory of IH surgery in the Netherlands, before the introduction of guidelines for IH treatment, to serve as a baseline for future evaluation of the impact of the implementation of these guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was performed in 2003 using patient and <b>operation</b> <b>charts</b> including IH repairs performed in The Netherlands over a three-month period (January-March 2001). RESULTS: 97 / 133 (73 %) hospitals cooperated with the study, generating data from a total of 4386 IH in 3979 patients (3284 adults, 695 children). Mesh techniques were used in 2839 (78 %) adult inguinal hernias while 800 (22 %) patients were treated with non-mesh techniques. 484 (14. 7 %) adult patients were operated on during the study period for a recurrent hernia from previous years. Early recurrence (< 1 year) occurred in 2. 2 % of all patients. Wound infection was documented in 0. 8 % of all IH. The mortality rate was 0. 1 %. 1257 of the 3284 (38. 3 %) adults, and 566 of the 695 children (81. 4 %), were operated on in ambulatory care.
