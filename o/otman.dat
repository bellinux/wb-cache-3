5|$|Feyenoord opened September with a 4–0 home win on {{the first}} day of the month against Roda JC. Four {{different}} Feyenoord players scored in the game; Vormer and Pellè in the first half and Nelom and Goossens after half time. The club announced halfway through the month they had signed <b>Otman</b> Bakkal without transfer fee. Bakkal had played for Feyenoord in the 2011–12 season as well before joining Russian club Dynamo Moscow for the 2012–13 season. On 15 September Feyenoord played the second game of the month in Nijmegen against N.E.C., the game ended in a 3-all draw after a last-minute equalizer by Bruno Martins Indi. The club got their third win in four league matches on 22 September at home due to the lone goal in the 35th minute from Tonny Vilhena against FC Utrecht. After a bye in the first round, Feyenoord started the 2013–14 KNVB Cup on the 26th at home against FC Dordrecht in the second round. They won the game 3–0; Pellè put the first goal on the board after 36 minutes, Schaken and Armenteros added a goal each to the scoreline in the second half. Feyenoord won the last match of September 4–2 at home against ADO Den Haag. They got up by four goals 18 minutes into the second half after a hattrick by Pellè and first half goal by Martins Indi; ADO got two goals on the board in the last ten minutes. From the five games in September, four league games and one cup game, Feyenoord drew one and won the other four.|$|E

In return, the club restocked with players such as Jordy Clasie, Miquel Nelom, Guyon Fernandez and Kaj Ramsteijn, who came mostly from their own youth academy. Two other players were loaned, John Guidetti from Manchester City and <b>Otman</b> Bakkal from PSV. Feyenoord started the season well and played the first match of the Eredivisie against the other Rotterdam club in the league, Excelsior. Feyenoord ended the season by placing second in the Eredivisie, resulting in the third qualifying round for Champions League football.|$|E

2500|$|On 20 November 2010, Suárez bit PSV's <b>Otman</b> Bakkal on the {{shoulder}} during a 0–0 draw. Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a [...] "good cause". The Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf branded Suárez the [...] "Cannibal of Ajax". The KNVB increased Suárez's suspension to seven league matches. Suárez apologised for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, the FA {{confirmed}} {{that they had}} charged Suárez with violent conduct, while Liverpool fined Suárez an undisclosed amount which he requested be donated to the Hillsborough Family Support Group. Suárez declared that he thought a three-match ban would suffice. His previous victim, <b>Otman</b> Bakkal, described it as [...] "unbelievable" [...] that Suárez could bite a second player, and was left flabbergasted at the incident, stating that [...] "at first I thought maybe {{it was an accident}} but, apparently, he loses it sometimes". Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman Gordon Taylor said that Suárez would be offered anger management counselling. Gus Poyet thought the reaction had been exaggerated, theorising that Suárez could leave English football if he carried on being punished and maligned for his actions, treatment he thought was hypocritical when compared to others.|$|E
50|$|Their relationship, however, was {{not always}} cordial, as {{scholars}} Stavrides and Gramatikova mention that <b>Otman</b> Baba frightened Mehmed II with his mastery over the elements, summoning a storm that flooded Constantinople after Mehmed ordered the dervish to enter a monastery. Although Küçük Abdal credits Mehmed II’s military victories to <b>Otman</b> Baba’s sainthood, the mystic predicted the sultan's defeat in the 1456 Serbia campaign. <b>Otman</b> Baba's relationships with other Ottoman authorities varied. Those opposed to <b>Otman</b> Baba included the orthodox vizier Mahmud Paşa, who did not recognize the mystic's sainthood, and an akıncı (military auxiliary), who apprehended <b>Otman</b> Baba and whose wife forced the mystic to pasture ducks for a month. A sancakbey (district governor) named Mihaloğlu Ali Bey, however, donated to <b>Otman</b> Baba's tomb after the mystic had supported his military victories.|$|E
5000|$|Other sources {{include the}} vilâyetname of <b>Otman</b> Baba's {{successor}} Demir Baba, {{which refers to}} <b>Otman</b> Baba as the [...] "pole of poles" [...] and [...] "Pole of the Universe and Time", symbols of his high spiritual rank; the vilâyetname also avouches <b>Otman</b> Baba’s ability to instantly appear and disappear. Another source {{is the work of}} Evliya Çelebi, which cites <b>Otman</b> Baba as a leader of ascetic dervishes and a gazi (religious warrior) who helped conquer the Ottoman Empire's European province of Rumelia.|$|E
50|$|Dervish leaders faced {{accusations of}} turning commoners against the Ottoman government’s policies. <b>Otman</b> Baba’s {{proselytizing}} in the Eastern Balkans and Anatolia {{coincides with the}} settlements of the nomadic Yürüks, who were hostile toward the Ottoman bureaucracy that forcibly recruited them as soldiers. Nevertheless, the vilâyetname asserts that Mehmed II recognized <b>Otman</b> Baba as a true saint and the true Ottoman leader, and it presents supportive interactions between <b>Otman</b> Baba and Mehmed II. In one account, <b>Otman</b> Baba appears in Mehmed’s dream to predict his reign as sultan while the then-prince was in Manisa.|$|E
5000|$|By 1451, <b>Otman</b> Baba had proselytized {{throughout}} Anatolia—particularly in Ottoman-ruled Western Asia Minor—working miracles and proving his sainthood. The vilâyetname offers conflicting {{accounts of}} <b>Otman</b> Baba's activities between 1451 and 1453. One holds that <b>Otman</b> Baba propagandized in Azeri lands, departing with the claim: [...] "I shall saddle a cloud, shall turn the lightning into a whip and shall {{go back to}} Rum." [...] Another asserts that <b>Otman</b> Baba stayed in Tarnovo as the guest of the local kadi (judge) and that locals bestowed the mystic with gifts after Ottoman forces had captured Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|According to the vilâyetname, <b>Otman</b> Baba {{was born}} in 1378 or 1379. Gramatikova proposes that <b>Otman</b> Baba came from Iranian, Azeri, or Central Asian territories and spoke an Azeri-accented Oghuz {{language}} with few Persian and Arabic influences, like the heterodox Muslims in northeastern Bulgaria. Küçük Abdal characterized <b>Otman</b> Baba spiritually as a saint and prophet and physically as imposing, strong, and brave.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 January 1478, <b>Otman</b> Baba and {{his disciples}} {{arrived at the}} {{unidentified}} village of Konukçu köy. He settled on the nearby riverbank opposite his followers and ordered them to construct a bridge “to {{go back to the}} place where they were before.” After the bridge was built, <b>Otman</b> Baba spoke his last words: [...] "Hey, destitute, miserable and feeble, you are afraid of Death. But I am not. In fact I am immortal, I have a horse, when I mount it I go to Heaven!" [...] According to a manuscript annotation, <b>Otman</b> Baba died on 8 Receb 1478. The vilâyetname describes <b>Otman</b> Baba’s body releasing a halo that lit the universe the day after his death and two disciples dreaming that <b>Otman</b> Baba rode a horse through a portal in the sea.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Otman</b> Baba (c. 1378 - 8 Receb 1478) was a 15th-century dervish who {{traveled}} throughout the Ottoman Empire, acquiring a following among heterodox Muslims in Bulgaria after 1445 {{that has developed}} into his veneration as a saint. After <b>Otman</b> Baba's death, a pilgrimage complex grew around his grave in the present-day Bulgarian village of Teketo, which was made a museum during communism. The hagiography of <b>Otman</b> Baba, written by his disciple Küçük Abdal and regarded by his followers as a canonical text, maintains that <b>Otman</b> Baba performed miracles that proved his superiority to other dervishes and Ottoman authorities, particularly Sultan Mehmed II. Straying from orthodox Islamic tenets, <b>Otman</b> Baba asserted his unity with God and his mastery of divine secrets—as the embodiment of monotheistic religious figures such as Muhammad, Jesus, and Moses.|$|E
5000|$|Gramatikova dates <b>Otman</b> Baba’s {{earliest}} {{presence in}} Bulgarian lands from 1445 to 1451, where he propagated and interpreted Islamic mysticism. Beginning his propagandizing alone, <b>Otman</b> Baba recruited dervish followers—called Abdals—from the Balkan Muslim population. [...] When <b>Otman</b> Baba defeated a lamia in the Ludogorie region, he achieved his first miracle in Bulgarian lands, {{an act that}} Gramatikova characterizes as [...] "one of the greatest miracles of the heterodox Muslim saints". <b>Otman</b> Baba travelled through the eastern foothills of Stara Planina, following Sufi doctrine by surviving on leaves and wild fruit as he meditated on God. Gramatikova proposes that the local woodcutters who saw him and hosted him in their village were Sufi Muslims and nomads who had migrated from Turkey during the mid-15th century. In the Kazanlak area, <b>Otman</b> Baba garnered a following of Sufi craftsmen and built a bridge with hunters, whom Gramatikova associates with nomadic Yürüks and Turcomans. Near Plovdiv, a local saint named Hasan Baba called <b>Otman</b> Baba the dual embodiment of Muhammed and Ali after spotting him in the Maritsa River.|$|E
50|$|Categorized by Markoff as a dervish {{branch of}} the heterodox Muslim Alevi (Alians), Kizilbash, and Shi'ites, the Baba'is have {{preserved}} their traditions in Bulgaria through the cult of <b>Otman</b> Baba. In Nova Zagora, the Kizilbash venerate the life of <b>Otman</b> Baba, considering him a local Shi'ite saint and regarding his tekke as their primary holy place in Bulgaria. According to Gramatikova, the vilâyetname of <b>Otman</b> Baba is a canonical text in Bulgaria’s heterodox Muslim community.|$|E
5000|$|Gramatikova {{states that}} <b>Otman</b> Baba {{followed}} the Khurasan-region Malamatiyya, a tradition characterized by its adherents’ independence of a director, a school, or conventional religious laws. Representing the doctrines of the halo of Muhammad {{and of the}} Perfect Man, <b>Otman</b> Baba held that the prophet Muhammad's divinity transmitted to the kutb, the highest ranking Sufi mystics. Furthermore, <b>Otman</b> Baba asserted that he—as a kutb—had mastered divine secrets, regarding himself above Ottoman rulers and other mystics and identifying himself as the religious and political figures Muhammad, Jesus, Moses, Huseyn, Timur, and Sultan Mehmed II. Making the heretical claims of omnipresence and omniscience, <b>Otman</b> Baba insisted that anyone who harmed him would be harming themselves by denying his unity with God {{and that he could}} see the poor, starving, and ill and aid them. Before his death, <b>Otman</b> Baba expressed his belief in immortality: [...] "Do not cry after me, because I am not dying, I shall live all the time on the earth and in the sky." ...|$|E
50|$|During his life, <b>Otman</b> Baba wandered {{throughout}} the Ottoman Empire, mainly in Rumelia, spending {{the most time}} in Bulgarian lands and Aegean Thrace. After 30 September 1429 or 19 September 1430, <b>Otman</b> Baba began proselytizing in Rumelia. He performed his first miracle in the Balkans in Babaeski, extinguishing a candlestick’s flame that had been lit by the mystic Sarı Saltık Baba, proving his sainthood to ordinary followers of Sufism. As Gramatikova notes, <b>Otman</b> Baba challenged rival Alevi and Bektashi spiritual guides and won, proving his spiritual superiority.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Otman</b> Baba's beliefs {{extended}} beyond the spiritual, as he disapproved of Turks speaking Persian and Arabic {{instead of their}} native tongue. <b>Otman</b> Baba maintained that [...] "the Oghuz language {{is the father of}} all languages" [...] and the [...] "only way to stay in the alien, unknown lands".|$|E

50|$|Gramatikova dates <b>Otman</b> Baba’s {{arrival in}} Constantinople to 1456, where he {{contributed to the}} {{charitable}} activities of every imaret and advocated the restoration of a fortress that he argued was the town of Hasan and Huseyn. After leaving Constantinople, <b>Otman</b> Baba spent time in Edirne with the Abdals and settled {{in the village of}} Tatar Köyü, which Gramatikova supposes is either the present-day village Radovets or Filipovo—both in the Topolovgrad municipality of Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|Written five-and-a-half {{years after}} his death, the vilâyetname (hagiography) of <b>Otman</b> Baba {{provides}} the most thorough if biased depiction of the mystic's life. It differs from similar hagiographic accounts, as it more prominently presents historical information during <b>Otman</b> Baba's lifetime. Written by a direct disciple of <b>Otman</b> Baba named Küçük Abdal (also Köğçek/Köçek Abdal), the original vilâyetname was entitled Haza Kitab-i Risale-i Vilâyet-name-i Sultan Baba, kaddes’ Allahu sırruh ül-aziz (This book is a book with description of the miracles of Sultan Baba, let Allah consecrate his tomb). Known manuscripts of the vilâyetname include a 260-page one transcribed by Şeyh Ömer (Umar) bin Dervish Ahmed in 1758 and one from the Bulgarian village of Gorna Krepost taken to Turkey with the Alevi emigrants. A modern Turkish retelling based on various sources also exists.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>Otman</b> Baba had {{rejected}} Mehmed II’s offers to build him a tekke, the mystic's followers developed a cult complex around his grave, {{located at the}} southeastern part of the Hızırilyas hill in the Haskovo-region village of Teketo. Evliya Çelebi reported a cloister near the Maden dere riverbank and credited Sultan Bayezid II {{for the construction of}} the tekke, which included a heptagonal refectory, shaped like a dervish cap and associated with the yediler (cult of the seven). Architectural historian Stephen Lewis also proposes the yediler symbolism of the seven-sided refectory—the türbe (mausoleum)—which he classifies as an early sixteenth-century Ottoman funerary monument, observing its domed structure and ashlar masonry. Gramatikova notes, however, that in 1492 Sultan Bayezid II blamed <b>Otman</b> Baba’s followers in Thrace for an assassination attempt on him and ordered their exile to Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the complex became a pilgrimage site for <b>Otman</b> Baba’s followers, Muslim locals, and the Romani—who, according to Ottoman documents, have venerated the türbe since at least 1568. Bulgarian scholar Markoff attributes the continued prominence of <b>Otman</b> Baba’s cult complex among Bulgarian miracle-seekers to its museum status during communism and protection during the Revival Process.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>Otman</b> Baba {{disapproved of}} mystics {{who worked for}} {{personal}} gain, he collected kurbans (livestock) for his Abdals. Illustrating the traits of an Abdal, <b>Otman</b> Baba said the following: [...] "An Abdal {{is the man who}} gives up all but Allah. He has passed through all stages of spiritual self-perfection and is guided only by divine love and divine truth. He is no longer a body. Renouncing imitation and subjection to the body he aims at Ayn el-Yakın." [...] Gramatikova interprets the term Ayn el-Yakın under Abdal and Bektashi teachings as experiencing God through God’s eyes.|$|E
5000|$|While {{those outside}} {{his inner circle}} knew him as <b>Otman</b> Baba, other dervishes and the aristocratic sayyids called him Şah-i Kerbelâ—a {{reference}} to the prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn, {{who died in the}} Battle of Karbala. A vilâyetname account attributes the mystic's common name [...] "Otman Baba" [...] to Ottoman ruler Mehmed II. When the sultan disguised himself as a commoner and visited the Eski Saray tekke (a gathering place for heterodox Muslims) in Constantinople, only <b>Otman</b> Baba recognized him. Convinced of the dervish’s sainthood, Mehmed addressed him as [...] "my beloved father, Otman"—"father" [...] translating in Turkish as [...] "baba".|$|E
