5|$|The <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> against {{successful}} applications, {{and only}} approximately 40,000 a year were approved. Refusal was often arbitrary, {{dependent on the}} goodwill of local officials. Members of the Party elite and cultural ambassadors were frequently given permission to travel, as were essential transport workers. However, they were not permitted to take their families with them.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen horses {{started at}} the 2013 Belmont Stakes. Oxbow drew the number seven post position, with rival Orb at post five. There were {{concerns}} about Stevens' fitness as he had missed races after being thrown from a horse the previous week, but medical tests {{showed no sign of}} injury. Oxbow was the third favorite at 5–1 on the morning line, but by race time his <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> at 10–1.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers were 12–10 {{against the}} Braves overall for the season, though the Braves outscored them {{by a single}} run (96 to 95) in those games. The Braves were a 5–8 betting {{favorite}} in Las Vegas on September 25 to win the pennant while the Dodgers had 6–5 odds. The World Series <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> evenly split, with 11–10 odds available at that time for either the Chicago White Sox (the American League champion) or the eventual NL pennant winner.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of fractional <b>odds</b> <b>is</b> known as Hong Kong odds. Fractional and Hong Kong <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> actually exchangeable. The {{only difference is}} that the UK <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> presented as a fractional notation (e.g. 6/5) whilst the Hong Kong <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> decimal (e.g. 1.2). Both exhibit the net return.|$|R

50|$|In poker, pot <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> {{the ratio}} of the current size of the pot to the cost of a {{contemplated}} call. Pot <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> often compared to the probability of winning a hand with a future card in order to estimate the call's expected value.|$|R
5|$|When {{the first}} Europeans entered Indiana during the 1670s, {{the region was}} in {{the final years of}} the Beaver Wars. The French {{attempted}} to trade with the Algonquian tribes in Indiana, selling them firearms in exchange for furs. This incurred the wrath of the Iroquois, who destroyed a French outpost in Indiana in retaliation. Appalled by the Iroquois, the French continued to supply the western tribes with firearms and openly allied with the Algonquian tribes. A major battle—and {{a turning point in the}} conflict—occurred near modern South Bend when the Miami and their allies repulsed a large Iroquois force in an ambush. With the firearms they received from the French, the <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> evened. The war finally ended in 1701 with the Great Peace of Montreal. Both Indian confederacies were left exhausted, having suffered heavy casualties. Much of Ohio, Michigan and Indiana was left depopulated as many tribes fled west to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Following a touchback, Indiana's offense {{started from}} its 20-yard line. The Hoosiers {{picked up a}} first down with two short rushes, then Dittoe {{completed}} a first-down pass to Lewis and advanced the ball into Tech territory. On his second play in Tech territory, Dittoe completed a long pass to Lewis for Indiana's first touchdown of the second half. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 4520, but with only 4:26 remaining in the game, the <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> long against Indiana challenging Tech's lead in a serious fashion. The Hoosier kickoff went out of bounds, and the Hokie offense began a drive from its 35-yard line. Virginia Tech began running out the clock, executing rushing plays and staying in bounds to maximize {{the amount of time}} run off the game clock. Tech was unable to get a first down, and the Hokie punt was returned to the Indiana 29-yard line. Indiana was stopped on three consecutive plays and appeared to be punting the ball. As they had earlier in the game, however, the Hoosiers executed a trick play, snapping the ball to linebacker Alfonzo Thurman instead of the punter. Thurman ran forward for 37yards—the Hoosiers' longest run of the game—and a first down. Despite the gain and a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Tech, Indiana was unable to score. Time ran out in the fourth quarter, and Virginia Tech earned the 4520 victory.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point of conversation was the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E
5000|$|Favoured in {{continental}} Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, decimal odds {{quote the}} ratio of the payout amount, including the original stake, to the stake itself. Decimal <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> generally considered the easiest to deal with as they reflect the inverse of the probability of an outcome. Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to the decimal value of the fractional odds plus one. [...] Thus even <b>odds</b> 1/1 <b>are</b> quoted in decimal odds as 2.00. The 4/1 fractional <b>odds</b> discussed above <b>are</b> quoted as 5.00, while the 1/4 <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> quoted as 1.25. This is considered to be ideal for parlay betting, because the <b>odds</b> to <b>be</b> paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on. Decimal <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> also favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. John {{says that}} the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> not {{affected}} by the previous outcomes so the <b>odds</b> must still <b>be</b> 50:50.|$|R

5|$|This simple {{philosophy}} was tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females {{at one end of the}} dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{low-level}} center dissipated {{later that}} afternoon, a well-defined mid-level center lingered. The National Hurricane Center initially assessed {{the remnants of}} Ophelia with a low chance of regeneration as deep convection fired {{in association with the}} low, but these <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> subsequently increased to a medium chance by the afternoon hours of September26. A new low-level circulation developed within the well-organized cloud mass, and the system was once again given a high chance of tropical cyclone formation that evening. Following an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance flight into the system, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Ophelia at 1200UTC on September27, and was once again upgraded to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h) 18hours later. As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the subtropical ridge positioned across the central Atlantic, it began to curve northward and intensify once again. Deep convection blossomed atop the center late on September28, and microwave imagery depicted the development of an eye. Upper-level outflow expanded in all four quadrants of the cyclone by the afternoon hours of September29, and satellite intensity estimates continued to rise, prompting the NHC to upgrade Ophelia to a Category1 hurricane by 1800UTC that day.|$|E

50|$|The <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> a {{ratio of}} probabilities; an <b>odds</b> ratio <b>is</b> {{a ratio of}} <b>odds,</b> that <b>is,</b> a ratio of ratios of probabilities. Odds-ratios are often used in {{analysis}} of clinical trials. While they have useful mathematical properties, they can produce counter-intuitive results: an event with an 80% probability of occurring is {{four times more likely}} to happen than an event with a 20% probability, but the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> 16 times higher on the less likely event (4-1 against, or 4) than on the more likely one (1-4, or 4-1 on, or 0.25).|$|R
5000|$|Odds for {{different}} outcomes in single bet are presented either in European format (decimal odds), UK format (fractional odds), or American format (moneyline odds). European format (decimal <b>odds)</b> <b>are</b> used in continental Europe, Canada, and Australia. They are {{the ratio of}} the full payout to the stake, in a decimal format. Decimal <b>odds</b> of 2.00 <b>are</b> an even bet. UK format (fractional <b>odds)</b> <b>are</b> used by British bookmakers. They are {{the ratio of the}} amount won to the stake - the solidus [...] "/" [...] is pronounced [...] "to" [...] for example 7/1 [...] "seven to one". Fractional <b>odds</b> of 1/1 <b>are</b> an even bet. US format <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> the amount won on a 100 stake when positive and the stake needed to win 100 when negative. US <b>odds</b> of 100 <b>are</b> an even bet.|$|R
50|$|If {{the figure}} quoted is negative, the moneyline <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> quoting {{how much money}} must be wagered to win $100 (this is done if the <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> worse than even). Fractional odds of 1/4 would be quoted as -400 while {{fractional}} odds of 4/1 cannot be quoted as a negative figure.|$|R
25|$|However, {{despite the}} near {{equality}} {{of the forces}} on paper, the <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> in Haig's favour, as his forces were cohesive, with superior organisation and training, whilst Grierson's were more of a scratch team.|$|E
25|$|The Roman bookmakers, {{accustomed}} to gambling on papal elections, did not regard d'Amboise's election as certainly as the Roman public. His <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> set at 13 to 100, while della Rovere's were 15 to 100; Cardinal Piccolomini (elected Pope Pius III) was the favorite at 30 to 100.|$|E
25|$|Once again, TNT and NEO Justice {{would do}} battle, {{this time in}} an 828 Street Fight. It would seem this time the <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> tipped in the challengers favor.

50|$|The overall odds of Mark Six, i.e. the {{probability}} of winning something is approximately 1:53.655. Compared to the biggest two lotteries available in the United States, Powerball (the overall <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> approximately 1:35) and Mega Millions (the overall <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> approximately 1:40), players have lower {{chance to win a}} prize in Mark Six.|$|R
50|$|The {{numerator}} and denominator of fractional <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> always integers, thus if the bookmaker's payout {{was to be}} £1.25 {{for every}} £1 stake, this would be equivalent to £5 for every £4 staked, and the <b>odds</b> would therefore <b>be</b> expressed as 5/4. However, not all fractional <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> traditionally read using the lowest common denominator. For example, given {{that there is a}} pattern of odds of 5/4, 7/4, 9/4 and so on, <b>odds</b> which <b>are</b> mathematically 3/2 are more easily compared if expressed in the equivalent form 6/4.|$|R
5000|$|Not all {{fractional}} <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> traditionally read {{using the}} lowest common denominator. Perhaps most unusual <b>is</b> that <b>odds</b> of 10:3 <b>are</b> read as [...] "one-hundred-to-thirty".|$|R
25|$|Despite low ratings, {{the show}} was renewed in 1993. The lower rated Santa Barbara was given the axe instead. But Another Worlds ratings still were not {{performing}} well, becoming the second-lowest rated soap opera on U.S. television at the time (ahead of only ABC's Loving) after Santa Barbaras cancellation. The <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> not in the show's favor {{that it would be}} renewed again in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that they were most likely facing two perpetrators, who had meticulously planned the murders in advance, due to the difficulties a single perpetrator would face in controlling both girls. As he attacked one, the other would {{have an opportunity to}} escape. In Baneheia, people are always close by, {{and there are plenty of}} hiding places among the pine thickets and rocks.

25|$|The aristocratic {{tradition}} in Armenia suffered another blow during the Bolshevik regime, when the nobility was dissolved {{as a social}} class and the noblemen underwent systematic oppression. Many representatives of the Armenian aristocracy were repressed, sentenced to prisons and work camps, or simply executed.

Only a very few managed to preserve their family traditions by leaving the Communist regime and moving to other countries.|$|E
25|$|Operation Bolo was a deception-based mission {{during the}} Vietnam War devised to lure fighter {{aircraft}} of the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) -- —into battle where the <b>odds</b> <b>were</b> stacked against the defenders. The mission was planned {{in response to}} North Vietnamese tactics during the Operation Rolling Thunder aerial-bombardment campaign wherein MiGs were used to attack heavily loaded fighter-bombers while circumventing their fighter escorts. The mission featured fighter planes following the typical flight paths of bombers in order to lure enemy aircraft into attacking.|$|E
