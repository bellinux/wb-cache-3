5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, <b>or</b> <b>these</b> may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E

Cocaine exposure in utero may affect the structure and function of the brain, predisposing children to developmental problems later, <b>or</b> <b>these</b> effects {{may be explained by}} children of crack-using mothers being at higher risk for domestic violence, deadbeat parenting, and maternal depression. When researchers are able to identify effects of PCE, these effects are typically small.|$|E

Montgomery said, [...] "None of these problems, these terrors <b>or</b> <b>these</b> specters that haunt us in 2010 are particularly new. Quite the opposite, in fact. We've just chosen to ignore the warnings. And now it might be too late." [...] According to turntablist Joe Hahn, the album's title is a reference to a line in the Hindu Sanskrit scripture the Bhagavad Gita [...] "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one," [...] which was made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb. The title also appears in the album's lead single [...] "The Catalyst", which appears in the line [...] "God save us everyone, will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?". The band said Oppenheimer's comments about the nuclear bomb influenced the apocalyptic themes of the album. The band wrote about these comments in the album's liner notes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Church of São Pedro (...) - Once {{a chapel}} {{dedicated}} to Saint Peter, it was expanded and remodelled, but reconstructed {{by order of}} the Conselho da Fazenda on 20 July 1620, and completed in 1690. In 1851, new works to repair the buildings were completed. Oral tradition indicates that the constructions and remodelling occurred in three different places within Salão (in Pé do Pico, later Achada da Igreja and finally in its present location), although no records provide dates for its original construction <b>or</b> <b>these</b> latter remodelling projects associated with the different locations.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{widespread}} hypothesis posits a Proto-Euphratean language that preceded Sumerian in Southern Mesopotamia and exerted an areal influence on it, {{especially in the}} form of polysyllabic words that appear [...] "un-Sumerian"–making them suspect of being loanwords–and are not traceable to any other known language. There is little speculation as to the affinities of this substratum language, <b>or</b> <b>these</b> languages, and it is thus best treated as unclassified. Researchers such as Gonzalo Rubio disagree with the assumption of a single substratum language and argue that several languages are involved. A related proposal by Gordon Whittaker is that the language of the proto-literary texts from the Late Uruk period ( [...] 3350–3100 BCE) is really an early Indo-European language which he terms [...] "Euphratic".|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Jim Kurring {{originated in the}} summer of 1998 when actor John C. Reilly grew a mustache out of interest and started putting together an unintelligent cop character. He and Anderson did a few parodies of COPS with the director chasing Reilly around the streets with a video camera. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh made an appearance in one of these videos. Some of Kurring's dialogue came from these sessions. This time around, Reilly wanted to do something different and told Anderson that he was [...] "always cast as these heavies <b>or</b> <b>these</b> semi-retarded child men. Can't you give me something I can relate to, like falling in love with a girl?" [...] Anderson also wanted to make Reilly a romantic lead because it was something different that the actor had not done before.|$|E

Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles <b>or</b> <b>these</b> popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how [...] "Cubism" [...] proceeds. Under the title of Nu , Jean Metzinger shows us [...] "cubes" [...] of various tones, but of the same color. The trick is to find the head, the arms at different points on the canvas. It's a distraction like any other, but it is not art. This is the latest cry of pictorial craziness [...]|$|E
2500|$|This {{section is}} {{composed}} of a selection of abbreviated Old Testament Psalm verses that are that are so ordered as to form a continuous prayer. The Book of Cerne only contains 272 verses, not the full 365 verses that are commonly found in these early Psalters. Psalms 118 to 136 are missing from this book, which {{may be due to}} errors in the exemplar from which it was copied, <b>or</b> <b>these</b> missing verses may not have suited the scribe’s or patron’s intentions. This form of abridged Psalm verses may suggest Irish influences, however, the Psalm texts used are from the Old Latin Romanum Psalter version, which supports the inference for an Anglo-Saxon composition.

2500|$|Later {{randomized}} controlled trials trials {{failed to find}} any improvement in survival, For example, in a trial of the treatment of advanced lung cancer, with either cisplatin and vinblastine <b>or</b> <b>these</b> drugs plus hydrazine sulfate, saw complete tumor regression in 4% of the hydrazine group, versus 3% in the control group, and tumor progression in 36% of the hydrazine group, versus 30% of the control group; however, none of these differences were statistically significant. Some trials even found both significantly decreased survival and significantly poorer {{quality of life in}} those patients receiving hydrazine sulfate. These consistently negative results have resulted in hydrazine sulfate being described as a [...] "disproven cancer therapy" [...] in a recent medical review. Similarly, other reviews have concluded that there is [...] "strong evidence" [...] against the use of hydrazine sulfate to treat anorexia or weight loss in cancer patients.|$|E

2500|$|The modern reader may read sonnet 20 and {{question}} {{whether or not}} Shakespeare's sexuality is reflected in this sonnet.

[...] There were words that identified what we would consider to be homosexual behaviour, but the idea of a [...] "gay culture" [...] or [...] "gay identity" [...] did not exist. [...] Charles {{goes on to say that}} early modern laws against sodomy had very few transgressors, which means that either people did not engage in homosexual behavior <b>or</b> <b>these</b> acts were more socially acceptable than the modern reader would think. Shakespeare's awareness of the possible homoeroticism in Sonnet 20 does not necessarily illuminate whether or not he himself was actually practicing homosexual behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The British colonial government, for instance, {{enacted the}} Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. This law {{declared}} everyone belonging to certain castes {{to be born}} with criminal tendencies. Ramnarayan Rawat, a professor of History and specialising in social exclusion in Indian subcontinent, states that the criminal-by-birth castes under this Act included initially Ahirs, Gurjars and Jats, but its enforcement expanded by the late 19th century to include most Shudras and untouchables, such as Chamars, as well as Sannyasis and hill tribes. Castes suspected of rebelling against colonial laws and seeking self-rule for India, such as the previously ruling families Kallars and the Maravars in south India and non-loyal castes in north India such as Ahirs, Gurjars and Jats, were called [...] "predatory and barbarian" [...] and added to the criminal castes list.
