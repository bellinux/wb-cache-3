25|$|Spontaneous {{and morning}} erections {{decrease}} significantly in frequency, although some {{patients who have}} had an <b>orchiectomy</b> still experience morning erections.

25|$|<b>Orchiectomy</b> or DES or {{both were}} the {{standard}} initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the GnRH agonist leuprolide {{was found to}} have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal <b>orchiectomy</b> - that is, surgical excision {{of the entire}} testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord).

40|$|To {{show the}} {{reliability}} of laparoscopic procedures in case of cryptorchidism. It also shows the growing possibilities of laparoscopic manipulations of the cryptorchid testis obviating in a great percentage the need for open operative procedures. Starting from the standard diagnostic laparoscopic procedure we gradually extended its use to a full operative procedure. The standard procedure is extensively elucidated {{in the way we}} used it in sixty-one laparoscopic procedures for seventy-four non-palpable testes. All laparoscopies were technically successful. Forty testes (60. 3 %) were found intra-abdominally. Four testes (5. 5 %) were found lying in the inguinal canal or in an ectopic position. Twenty-five testes were absent. The diagnosis of a vanishing testis could be established in most of these cases. In the beginning period the following open procedures were done after the diagnostic laparoscopy: sixteen open explorations, ten formal standard orchidopexies; nine <b>orchiectomies,</b> nine autotransplantations, and three Fowler-Stephens procedures. In recent years we proceeded with laparoscopic manipulation, performing eleven laparoscopically assisted orchidopexy procedures (LAOPs), six extended laparoscopic explorations, and two laparoscopic <b>orchiectomies.</b> Laparoscopy is not only a safe and reliable method in diagnosing the presence of a nonpalpable testis, but also thanks to more sophisticated instruments allows us more and more to perform the complete treatment. It can facilitate the placement of surgical incisions or obviate the need for further open intervention if no spermatic vessels are visualized in the abdome...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The testicular, deferential, and cremasteric {{arteries and}} their {{branches}} surround the vas deferens (VD), leaving them susceptible to injury during vasectomy. Literature describing {{the caliber of}} arteries seen in vasectomy specimens is lacking, {{making it difficult to}} categorize the significance of an observed artery. We aimed to establish reference values for arterial size typically encountered in vasectomy specimens and assess our institutional experience with failure to transect the VD. Methods: The luminal diameter of the largest artery in 231 consecutive VD specimens from 116 patients was measured microscopically. For comparison, the diameter of the largest artery within 10 spermatic cord cross-sections from inguinal <b>orchiectomies</b> was obtained. The immediat...|$|R
40|$|A case {{of giant}} {{testicular}} tumor associated with scrotal gangrene is reported. A 33 -year-old {{man had a}} swollen scrotum (15 cm) accompanied with necrosis and a foulodor. The tumor had invaded the scrotum, perineum and the left spermatic cord. Serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 15, 487 ng/ml. The chest radiograph revealed multiple metastases. Bilateral high <b>orchiectomies</b> and local resection with a wide margin were performed. The tumor weighed 2. 5 kg and the histopathological diagnosis was teratocarcinoma. He was treated with 3 courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide and peplomycin. A second-look surgery revealed no viable cancer cells in the residual masses. The patient has been free of recurrence 4 months postoperatively...|$|R
25|$|Each {{treatment}} has disadvantages that limit {{its use in}} certain circumstances. Although <b>orchiectomy</b> is a low-risk surgery, the psychological impact of removing the testicles can be significant, and sterility is certain. The loss of testosterone can cause hot flashes, weight gain, loss of libido, enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), impotence, penile atrophy, and osteoporosis. GnRH agonists eventually cause the same side effects as <b>orchiectomy</b> but may cause worse symptoms {{at the beginning of}} treatment. When GnRH agonists are first used, testosterone surges can lead to increased bone pain from metastatic cancer, so antiandrogens or abarelix is often added to blunt these side effects. Estrogens are not commonly used because they increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and blood clots. In general, the antiandrogens do not cause impotence, and usually cause less loss of bone and muscle mass. Ketoconazole can cause liver damage with prolonged use, and aminoglutethimide can cause skin rashes.|$|E
25|$|Individuals make {{different}} choices regarding sex reassignment therapy, {{which may}} include female-to-male or male-to-female {{hormone replacement therapy}} (HRT) to modify secondary sex characteristics, sex reassignment surgery (such as <b>orchiectomy)</b> to alter primary sex characteristics, chest surgery such as top surgery or breast augmentation, or, {{in the case of}} trans women, a trachea shave, facial feminization surgery or permanent hair removal.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected testicle (<b>orchiectomy).</b> While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.|$|E
40|$|A 40 -year-old male {{presented}} to our outpatient department {{with the chief}} complaint of a painless mass on his right testis with gradual size increase {{over the past two}} months. Physical examination and ultrasound revealed a firm and nontender mass both on the right and on the left testis. The only elevated biomarker was b-hcG (24, 7 [*]mIU/mL) and computer tomography (CT) did not reveal any pathology. Bilateral high <b>orchiectomies</b> were performed, without previous frozen storage of the sperm. Histology proved typical seminoma of the left testis and embryonal carcinoma of the right testis. He received two cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Six months after the operation no residual tumor or recurrence was observed...|$|R
40|$|Conducting {{research}} on resource allocation {{is essential to}} understanding growth, development {{and the distribution of}} resources in organisms. Studies have shown that because resources in an organism are limited, they are allocated to certain structures of the body, and tradeoffs are made between these structures, particularly when changes are induced in those organisms. In this study, we investigate how resources are distributed in moths that have undergone pupal <b>orchiectomies</b> (removal of the testes) compared to those that have not, in longevity and dry weight experiments. We find evidence that thorax weights differ between sham and surgery individuals, and that survival differs between individuals with and without testes. Our findings indicate that the distribution of resources is determined by structure size, as opposed to structure proximity...|$|R
40|$|A 37 -year-old male was {{presented}} with an upper abdominal mass. A retroperitoneal bulky tumor was detected and operative biopsy revealed seminoma. The right testis was undescended and atrophic which was located at the left inguinal lesion. Pathologically, the primary tumor cells were {{not found in the}} left <b>orchiectomied</b> testis, but only scar and fibrosis were compatible with a burned-out testicular tumor. This patient showed partial regression by multidisciplinary therapy including combined chemotherapy with CDDP, etoposide and peplomycin, and is still on the same condition and alive for 3 years. In case of extragonadal germ cell tumor without apparent testicular involvement, it is a problem to differentiate primary extragonadal germ cell tumor from occult and burned-out testicular tumor. Testis should be examined by all means available including careful exploration...|$|R
25|$|Although the {{prostate}} was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, {{and illustrated by}} Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853. Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction. Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Surgical removal of the testes (<b>orchiectomy)</b> to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. Transurethral resection of {{the prostate}} (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction {{in the middle of}} the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orchiectomy,</b> {{also called}} [...] "castration," [...] is {{surgery to remove}} the {{testicles}}. Because the testicles make most of the body's testosterone, after <b>orchiectomy</b> testosterone levels drop. Now the prostate not only lacks the testosterone stimulus to produce DHT but also {{does not have enough}} testosterone to transform into DHT. <b>Orchiectomy</b> is considered the gold standard of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Inguinal <b>orchiectomy</b> is the {{preferred}} method because it lowers the risk of cancer cells escaping. This is because the lymphatic system of the scrotum, through which white blood cells (and, potentially, cancer cells) flow in and out, links to the lower extremities, while that of the testicle links {{to the back of}} the abdominal cavity (the retroperitoneum). [...] A transscrotal biopsy or <b>orchiectomy</b> will potentially leave cancer cells in the scrotum and create two routes for cancer cells to spread, while in an inguinal <b>orchiectomy</b> only the retroperitoneal route exists.|$|E

40|$|In a 44 -year-old {{man with}} {{persistent}} back-pain for 3 months duration, radiological and echological investigations revealed prostatic mass lesion with multiple osteoblastic involvements. Transrectal biopsy to the prostate demonstrated pathohistologically poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Gleason's score 4 - 4 : 8). Serum ACP, ALP and IAP were elevated {{at the initial}} diagnosis pathologically. The clinical and pathological stage was D 2, without metastasis to lung and liver. Combination chemo-endocrine therapy (methotrexate, adriamycin, pepleomycin, Estracyt and tegafur) with bilateral <b>orchiectomies</b> was performed exclusively as initial treatment. These consecutive treatments brought remarkable reduction of the prostatic mass lesion, decrease of tumor markers to normal range, rapid improvement of subjective symptoms and distinct decrease of abnormal activity in bone scintigram. More than 3 years survival was obtained, and normal performance-status was kept. Prostatic cancer in middle-aged adults is reviewed and discussed...|$|R
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth will want or need to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or Leuprolide Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, <b>orchiectomies,</b> breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals), with the aim of bringing one’s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender dysphoria.|$|R

2500|$|Prior {{to gender}} {{confirmation}} surgery, dosages of estrogen for transgender {{people are often}} higher than replacement dosages used for cisgender women. Hembree et al. (2009) recommend [...] "maintain sex hormone levels within the normal range for the person’s desired gender". Dosages are typically reduced after an <b>orchiectomy</b> (removal of the testes) or sex reassignment surgery. However, that practice has been carried over from {{an era in which}} very high doses of estrogen were required to decrease testosterone, since antiandrogens were not used concurrently. Today, high doses of a less potent estrogen – estradiol, which is endogenous to the human body, rather than the riskier ethinylestradiol and conjugated estrogens used in the past – are recommended during the first ten or so years of HRT, with or without an <b>orchiectomy</b> or genital reassignment. After that period, dosages can be reduced.|$|E
40|$|A 51 -year-old {{man with}} type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} presented to the emergency room with increasing bilateral leg pain, rash, and scrotal swelling with pain. Skin biopsy from his thigh revealed IgA-associated vasculitis. Due to hematuria, a renal biopsy was performed and showed an IgA glomerulonephritis with focal fibrinoid necrosis and neutrophil accumulation. Bilateral <b>orchiectomies</b> were performed in two separate procedures ten and thirteen days after the renal biopsy, as a result of uncontrolled abscess formation in testicles. Microscopically, both testicles revealed large abscess formation destroying almost the entire testicular parenchyma without tumor cells. Spermatic cord margins were further scrutinized microscopically to show bilateral vasculitis in many small size vessels, confirmed by positive endothelial staining for IgA. Some of the affected arteries revealed central organizing thrombi with recanalization features, highly suggestive of vasculitis-associated thrombi formation, resulting in testicular ischemic infarction and abscess formation. We conclude that this adult patient developed a severe form of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, with vasculitis affecting multiple organs, including the most serious and unusual complication of bilateral testicular infarction...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesThomas SchermerhornThe use of {{continuous}} blood glucose monitors (CBGMs) has recently come into favor in human medicine {{for the control}} and monitoring of the diabetic patient. It allows for {{a higher degree of}} accuracy of the true glucose curve throughout a 72 -hour period. With this information, physicians are better equipped to treat and manage diabetic patients. Recently, this modality has been verified for use in veterinary patients including cats and dogs. This is an excellent source of information, especially in the management of difficult to regulate veterinary patients. This device has potential for use in various applications, particularly for the monitoring of patients with various diseases under general anesthesia. In order to ensure accurate results do occur when an animal is under general anesthesia, the continuous blood glucose monitor was evaluated on apparently healthy patients under anesthesia for routine procedures such as ovariohysterectomies and <b>orchiectomies.</b> In this manner, the monitor was tested on anesthetized patients that had the potential to experience hypothermia, hypotension, and other anesthesia-associated complications that can be typical of patients that could benefit from the CGMS...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the protective effects of lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4) in rat testis injury following testicular torsion/detorsion. Methods. A rat testicular torsion {{model has been}} established as described. Rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: sham group, torsion group, torsion/detorsion (T/D) group, and T/D plus LXA 4 -pretreated groups (3 subgroups). Rats in LXA 4 -pretreated groups received LXA 4 injection (0. 1, 1. 0, and 10 [*]μg/kg body weight in LXA 4 -pretreated subgroups 1 – 3, resp.) at a single dose 1 [*]h before detorsion. Biochemical analysis, apoptosis assessment, and morphologic evaluation were carried out after <b>orchiectomies.</b> Results. GPx and SOD levels significantly increased and MDA levels significantly reduced in LXA 4 -pretreated groups compared to T/D group. LXA 4 also reverted IL- 2 and TNF-α to basal levels and improved the expression of IL- 4 and IL- 10 in LXA 4 -pretreated groups. Moreover, the expression of NF-κB was downregulated in LXA 4 -pretreated groups. LXA 4 treatment also showed an improved testicular morphology and decreased apoptosis in testes. Conclusion. Lipoxin A 4 protects rats against testes injury after torsion/detorsion via modulation of cytokines, oxidative stress, and NF-κB activity...|$|R
2500|$|Since {{only one}} testis is {{typically}} {{required to maintain}} fertility, hormone production, and other male functions, the afflicted testis is almost always removed completely in a procedure called inguinal <b>orchiectomy.</b> (The testicle is almost never removed through the scrotum; an incision is made beneath the belt line in the inguinal area.)

40|$|Abstract- Anandamide is an {{endogenous}} ligand for cannabinoid receptors and has endothelial {{protective effect}} against ischemic preconditioning. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects of cannabinoids on reperfusion injury due to testicular torsion-detorsion (T/D). A total of 36 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups. Testicular ischemia was achieved by twisting the right testes 720 ◦ counters clockwise for 1 hour and reperfusion was allowed for 4 hours after detorsion. In baseline (normal) group, bilateral <b>orchiectomies</b> performed after anesthesia. Sham operated group was served as a control group. Torsion/detorsion group underwent 1 hour testicular torsion and 4 hours of detorsion. Anandamide (cannabinoid agonist) group received pretreatment with intraperitoneally anandamide 30 min before torsion. AM 251 (CB 1 antagonist) group, received intraperitoneally injection of AM 251 45 min before torsion. Anandamid/AM 251 (An/AM) group received administrations of AM 251 45 min before torsion and anandamide 30 min before torsion. The ipsilateral malondialdehyde (MDA) level in T/D group were significantly higher versus control and base line groups.

40|$|Aims and Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} phytoestrogen diet alone and high phytoestrogen diet with rutin and naringin on male reproductive system. Experimental Protocol: A total of 48 adult male wistar albino rats were divided in to 8 groups, each contains 6 rats. Low phytoestrogen diet (LPD) and high phytoestrogen diet (HPD) were administered to the two different groups of rats for 35 days. Rutin and naringin, antioxidants were also given in different doses (5 mg/kg, 10 /kg) {{for a period of}} 35 days along with high phytoestrogen diet in different groups of rats. A sham control group animals fed on commercial pellet diet and vehicle control group animals with 0. 1 % sod CMC were also maintained until completion of 35 days. On 36 th day bilateral <b>orchiectomies</b> were performed for all the animals. The testicular tissue was evaluated for various sperm parameters, biochemical estimations and histological changes. Results: Animals fed on low and high phytoestrogen diets has shown fall in sperm parameters and lipid peroxidation and increase in testicular antioxidant enzymes. Rutin and naringin have not shownany significant effect on sperm parameters. But decrease in lipid peroxidation and increase in antioxidant enzymes was observed. No histological changes were observed. Conclusions: High phytoestrogen diet has reduced all the sperm parameters drastically. Antioxidants have not shown any effect on sperm parameters but amplified the antioxidant enzymes and reducedMDA levels...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the best approach}} to impalpable testes. We determined the usefulness of diagnostic laparoscopy {{for the management of}} impalpable testes. Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2008, 86 patients {{with a mean age of}} 34 months underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. An inguinal canal exploration was performed in all cases, except in patients in whom the internal spermatic vessels terminated intraperitoneally with a blind end. Results: The undescended testis was right-sided in 24 patients (27. 9 %), left-sided in 47 patients (54. 7 %), and bilateral in 15 patients (17. 4 %). Three patients (3. 5 %) had bilateral impalpable testes. The vas and vessels traversed the internal ring in 51 of 89 impalpable testes (57. 3 %); 20 (22. 5 %) were localized intraperitoneally, and 18 (20. 2 %) were diagnosed as vanishing testes. Open orchiopexies were performed on 24 testes (27. 0 %) and <b>orchiectomies</b> were performed on 43 nubbin testes (48. 3 %). After a mean follow-up period of 30 months, 12 of the 14 testes (85. 7 %) were viable following open conventional orchiopexy, compared with 6 of the 10 testes (60 %) following a 1 -stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy. Conclusions: Diagnostic laparoscopy is a very helpful and minimally invasive technique in the diagnosis of impalpable testes, especially when preoperative ultrasonography is not sufficiently informative.
