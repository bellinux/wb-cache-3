40|$|Despite {{a series}} of revaluations, which started in July 2005, hot money has been {{sporadically}} sneaking into China in anticipation of further revaluations of the renminbi. In this paper we build a monetary model to show how anticipated revaluations lead to the instability of a pegged exchange rate regime. This model assumes current account convertibility and some degree of capital control, and fundamentally sound domestic policies and economy, {{as is the case}} in China. The model demonstrates that market-oriented interest rates can act as an automatic stabilizer to ease revaluation pressures, but cannot resolve them completely because the nominal interest rate has a zero nominal bound. Therefore, the <b>official</b> <b>parity</b> is difficult to defend and the revaluation expectations can be self-fulfilling, in the absence of external intervention.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of America {{was followed by}} a flow of precious metals to Spain and Portugal, and from there throughout the world. Historiography has reconstructed the quantities of gold and silver transferred from the New World to the Old World in the Early Modern period, but what was the reason for the bullion outflows? This dissertation answers this question. In particular, it examines the logic of silver outflows from Cadiz to London {{in the first half of}} the 18 th century. Castile enacted bullionist laws during more than four centuries, from the Late Middle Ages to mid- 19 th century. The laws fixed prices and placed bans on export. But these measures did not prevent the export of silver and instead caused a great deal of smuggling. This dissertation aims at understanding the logic of silver outflows focusing on the smugglers' point of view: arbitrage. In this regard, the archive of the merchant house Roux (Marseille), probably the best preserved 18 th century commercial archive in Europe, has made possible the reconstruction of the specie-point mechanism for silver - the Old Mexican pieces of eight - between Cadiz and London as exactly practiced by contemporary merchants. The {{discovery of}} half-monthly data on silver black market in Cadiz for the period 1729 - 1741 has been a milestone in order to understand the logic of silver outflows. Empirical result from these data for arbitrage equation presents a puzzle for our understanding of the specie-point mechanism: from 1729 to 1737 there was a systematic bias between the implicit spot exchange rate and the arbitrated parity, which made arbitrage systematically profitable. On the contrary, from 1737 to 1741 the bias was corrected because the Spanish government reacted to illegal bullion outflows with a devaluation, which equalized the exchange rates and the arbitrated parity. This research explores both theoretically and empirically the reasons for the apparent mispricing for the first period and the effect of the devaluation on silver prices for the second period. The outcome is that bullionist regulations configured an oligopsony structure in Cadiz that had the power to drive down silver prices below the international price (i. e., London price). Oligopsony agents were the most important foreign merchants in Cadiz, organized in family and partnership networks which were rice-makers; their structure was maintained because the long-run international networks created entry barriers in the business of illegal export of bullion. Secrecy was reserved because both sides of the market cheated the Spanish government: importers from the Spanish American colonies saved the high import tax and exporters to the ain European bullion markets ignored the ban against exports. Nevertheless, oligopsony power had a floor, which was the <b>Official</b> <b>Parity</b> (i. e., the number of units of account per coin). Below the <b>Official</b> <b>Parity,</b> the pieces of eight were used as money and went out from the commodity market. The devaluation of 1737 should be understood as an increment of the <b>Official</b> <b>Parity</b> for eliminating oligopsony power. Some main lessons emerge from this dissertation. First, understanding the reasons of the specie flows in the Early Modern period demands comprehension of the specie-point mechanism. Second, the construction of the silver-points requires the location, collection and manipulation of the right data: market prices, exchange rates and costs of arbitrage. And third, the interpretation of the arbitrage results needs to focus on the special microeconomic features of the bullion market structure. This is an original approach which will provide a lot of insight into the workings of commodity money. The first chapter describes the Castilian stagnated legislation and immobile institutions established with the aim of avoiding bullion outflows: fixed prices and bans on export. The second chapter analyses the specie-point mechanism in the institutional setting of bullion controls: the case of silver Pieces of Eight between Cadiz and London during the period 1729 - 1741. Arbitrage equation shows a systematic bias between the spot exchange rate and the arbitrated parity corrected by the 1737 devaluation. The third chapter analyses the specie-point mechanism in the institutional setting of free bullion movement: the case of gold and silver bars between London and Amsterdam during the period 1734 - 1758. London-Amsterdam bullion market was integrated, and arbitrage equation shows only few and non persistent breaks. The fourth chapter tells the story of the agents involved in the illegal exchanges of silver in Cadiz, and demonstrates that the smugglers were the French merchants who obtained the highest income of all merchants in Cadiz. The fifth chapter examines the contemporary Castilian reports against smuggling in order to describe how the illegal exchange took place. Smuggling was reserved to foreign merchants because they had achieved privileges which prevented them to be prosecuted. The sixth chapter demonstrates that the smugglers were organized in long-run networks which conferred them the market power to drive down bullion prices below the international price, and the international connections to illegally extract and distribute the bullion from Cadiz. The seventh chapter develops a static model of partial equilibrium for commodity-money in order to understand the workings of the oligopsonistic silver-commodity market and the effect of devaluation on the bullionist goal of treasuring silver. We will end offering some conclusions. Appendices explain the construction of the specie-point mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Faced {{with the}} two {{extremes}} of fixed and rigid parities on the one hand, and a system of floating rates on the other, many economists have proposed a system based on <b>official</b> sliding <b>parities.</b> According to this line of reasoning, floating exchanges is unachievable politically and therefore this solution would be the maximum concession towards floating that one may hope to negotiate. In this paper, the authors develop a different argument in favour of sliding pegs as compared to either extremes and conclude that such a system combines the advantages of short-run fixity in mitigating propagation of cyclical disturbances with long-run or structural changes in surplus or deficit.

40|$|On August 11 2015, China revamped its {{procedure}} of setting the <b>official</b> central <b>parity</b> of the renminbi (RMB) against the US dollar. Our empirical investigation {{shows that the}} intertemporal dynamics of China 2 ̆ 019 s central parity {{are not the same}} before and after this policy change. They are more variable and have a few new determining factors. Both the deviation of the RMB offshore rate from the central parity and the US dollar index are the two significant determinants of the central parity {{both before and after the}} policy change. The VIX index has explanatory power before August 2015, but not after. After August 2015, the onshore RMB rate and the difference between the one-month offshore and onshore RMB forward points show a significant impact on the central parity. While the US dollar index effect remains, we find no evidence of a role for the RMB exchange rate against the currency basket revealed by China in December 2015 in the fixing process...|$|R

40|$|Monetary {{authorities}} of many open economies have been regularly intervening in foreign exchange markets {{for years to}} limit volatility in exchange rates and/or push exchange rates back to some desired level. Such interventions have taken the form of actual and oral official interventions. Review of studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions reveals one major issue, related to the assumption that interventions are mostly sterilized. This assumption might lead to unreliable results when changes in interest rates and interventions are both used as explanatory variables for exchange rates. One major consistent finding is that intervention has a significant but short-lasting effect on exchange rates. Studies have reached this conclusion by investigating whether intervention has been effective in turning around the exchange rate over the few days, weeks or months following intervention(s). Only {{a few studies have}} investigated and provided evidence that intervention has been effective in limiting long swings in exchange rates. Studies testing for the effectiveness of interventions specifically through the signaling channel also provide evidence on the importance of macroeconomic variables for exchange rates. The significance of official intervention and official communication for exchange rate movements combined with the importance of macroeconomic variables for exchange rates provide a role for <b>official</b> intervention and <b>parity</b> announcement to influence exchange rate movements and limit the magnitude of exchange rate swings. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{prevalence}} of type 2 diabetes, often leading to diabetic nephropathy, has increased globally, especially in Asia. Irbesartan treatment delays {{the progression of}} kidney disease at the early (microalbuminuria) and late (proteinuria) stages of nephropathy in hypertensive type 2 diabetics. This treatment {{has proven to be}} cost-effective in Western countries. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of early irbesartan treatment in Asian settings. MethodsAn existing lifetime model was reprogrammed in Microsoft Excel to compare irbesartan started at an early stage to irbesartan or amlodipine started at a late stage, and standard treatments from a health-care perspective in China, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, and Taiwan. The main effectiveness parameters were incidences of end-stage renal disease, time in dialysis, and life expectancy. All costs were converted to 2004 US$ using <b>official</b> purchasing power <b>parity.</b> Local data were obtained for costs, transplantation,dialysis, and mortality rates. Probabilities regarding disease progression after treatment with the investigated drugs were extracted from two published clinical trials. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. ResultsEarly use of irbesartan yielded the largest clinical and economic benefits reducing need for dialysis by 61 % to 63 % versus the standard treatment, total costs by 9 % (Thailand) to 42 % (Taiwan), and increasing life expectancy by 0. 31 to 0. 48 [*]years. Early irbesartan had a 66 % (Thailand) to 95 % (Taiwan) probability of being dominant over late irbesartan. ConclusionAlthough the absolute results varied in different settings, reflecting differences in epidemiology, management, and costs, early irbesartan treatment was a cost-effective alternative in the Asian settings...|$|R
40|$|From its remote {{beginnings}} to the present, Christianity {{has sought}} to understand and proclaim the truth of revelation entrusted to it by the Lord, and to express this authentically for each successive generation of believers. For the first millennium Church, this process was characteristically embodied in the written and spoken reflection upon various theological issues of moment, and enunciated frequently through local or general synods. The manner in which these crucial questions were answered, not merely the answers themselves, determined not only the disposition of dogma but {{the manner in which}} ecclesial communion or koinonia would exist within the constituent families of churches within the una sancta. Among the most significant of these were the third century disputes regarding the nature of unity and diversity in the Godhead as three equally divine and eternal Hypostases or Persons. In the following century, controversies arose concerning Christ 2 ̆ 7 s equality and relationship to God the Father and the Holy Spirit. By the fifth century further controversies ensued which concerned how and to what degree the divine Hypostasis was united to the humanity of Christ. This last series of Christological disputes significantly represented the theological divergencies between the Alexandrine or 2 ̆ 2 Cyrillian 2 ̆ 2 school of thought and that of Cappadocia. The former understood the reality of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s coexistent humanity and divinity within the unity of one nature; the latter held that two natures existed in the hypostatic union. (Such controversy itself originated in response to the earlier so-called Nestorian controversy, in which Christ 2 ̆ 7 s unity was understood to be that of two Persons.) To clarify the orthodox teaching, the general council of Chalcedon in 451 decreed that the 2 ̆ 2 one and the same Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son must be confessed to be in two natures, without mixture, without change, indivisibly, inseparably [united] [...] . each nature being preserved and united in one Person and subsistence, not separated or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son and only-begotten. 2 ̆ 2 (From the Symbol of Chalcedon) Rather than uniting the Church and harmonizing its kerygmatic base, the linguistic usages employed at the council and the philosophies upon which they were based brought differing paradigms of theological discourse into even greater relief [...] -and into a collision course. The pro 2 ̆ 2 Alexandrine 2 ̆ 2 rejection of the conciliar decrees, along with the council 2 ̆ 7 s anathematization of leading dissenters and their supporters, sowed the seeds for a separation in juridical and sacramental communion between the Byzantine church (along with the Latin church) and the Alexandrine-Cyrillian churches of Alexandria and Antioch. Within decades, neither side (with some significant exceptions) accepted the other as orthodox [...] -whether as part of the una sancta or in matters of Christology. In time, these differences in Christological expression led to the identification of those holding Cyrillian-based Christology as Monophysite or 2 ̆ 2 one-natured 2 ̆ 2 by the Byzantine and Latin churches, wrongly assuming that the latter believed that Christ possessed a single (divine) nature. (The term Dyophysite or 2 ̆ 2 two-natured 2 ̆ 2 was also sometimes used by Cyrillian churches, with the equally wrong assumption that Byzantine and Latins faithful believed that Christ possessed two natures, i. e. two persons, in the extreme Antiochene theological sense.) Thanks in great measure to ecumenical dialogue, by {{the latter half of the}} twentieth-century, more objective and critical understandings were gained with regard to the circumstances surrounding the schism, leading also to the conclusion that the mutual Orthodox charges of 2 ̆ 2 Dyophysitism 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Monophysitism 2 ̆ 2 are no longer valid. Indeed, since the 1990 s it has become the avowed position of some 2 ̆ 2 Chalcedonian 2 ̆ 2 or Eastern Orthodox churches and all 2 ̆ 2 Cyrilline 2 ̆ 2 or Oriental Orthodox churches that both communions teach authentically the reality of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s dual and co-existent humanity and divinity in the unity of the divine Person. (It should also be noted that the Church of Rome and other Western confessions have similarly recognized this development.) Despite numerous examples of amicable and fruitful cooperation at times between the two communions in recent decades, however, the respective communions have made almost no progress toward establishment of a unified communion, permitted unrestricted mutual sacramental, pastoral and canonical <b>parity.</b> <b>Official</b> commissions by both groups have been established, and earnest, mutual sharing of a dual-evolved Orthodox tradition has been warmly received by one-another in a number of places. In the meantime, however, separate altars, separate missions and, ultimately, 2 ̆ 2 separate Orthodoxies 2 ̆ 2 remain. In the course of this work, I will outline more specifically various issues and circumstances which brought about this separation and the attempts to heal it [...] -most particularly those of the latter 20 th century. I will also devote particular attention to the numerous sociological, cultural and theological issues of our time which present obstacles, despite the acceptance of the 2 ̆ 2 Chalcedonian Definition 2 ̆ 2 by the Oriental churches and provide a justification why a new koinonia between the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox should be sought. Finally, it is my intention to investigate the arguments produced against integral union between the bodies and propose systemic solutions, along with possible implications for a future union...|$|R
