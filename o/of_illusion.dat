5|$|On release, Famitsu {{magazine}} {{gave the}} original Super Famicom version {{a score of}} 36 out of 40, with all four reviewers giving it a 9 out of 10. This made it one of their three highest-rated games of 1992, along with Dragon Quest V and World <b>of</b> <b>Illusion</b> Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Shin Megami Tensei {{was also one of}} only eleven games to have received a Famitsu score of 36/40 or above up until 1992. For subsequent console ports, Famitsu gave scores of 25/40 (PCE), 28/40 (MD), 30/40 (PS), and 27/40 (GBA).|$|E
5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle <b>of</b> <b>illusion),</b> the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{identifies}} Maya with Sita, the inseparable {{energy of}} Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. Vidya Maya {{is the cause}} of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya is the cause <b>of</b> <b>illusion</b> and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya. Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.|$|E
50|$|The {{easiest to}} explore are the geometrical-optical illusions that {{show up in}} {{ordinary}} black and white line drawings.

City <b>of</b> <b>Illusions</b> was initially published with no introduction, but Le Guin wrote an introduction for Harper & Row's 1978 hardcover edition. City <b>of</b> <b>Illusions</b> was reissued along with Rocannon's World and Planet of Exile in a 1978 omnibus volume titled Three Hainish Novels, and again in 1996 with the same novels in Worlds <b>of</b> Exile and <b>Illusion.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises the world <b>of</b> <b>illusion.</b> She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without {{the realization of}} this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Maya, or the {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>illusion,</b> {{is not new}} to oriental philosophy.

25|$|Brian Braddock has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, senses, and {{the ability}} to fly at {{supersonic}} speeds. He also possesses enhanced perceptions that allow him to be aware of things others may miss (such as objects cloaked by spells <b>of</b> <b>illusion).</b> When he and Meggan destroyed the Otherworld energy matrix at Roma's prompting, the energies that allowed him to retain his power within the UK without his costume were dissipated. Hence, to retain his powers anywhere on Earth, he must wear the costume at all times. His costume acts as an antenna and battery, allowing him to retain his powers wherever he goes.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, James L. Calderwood {{offered a}} new {{view on the}} role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts <b>of</b> <b>illusion.</b> Oberon, in his view, is the {{interior}} dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.|$|E
25|$|The most {{noticeable}} trait {{of the early}} entremets was the focus on vivid colors. Later on, the entremets would take the shape of various types <b>of</b> <b>illusion</b> foods, such as peacocks or swans that were skinned, cooked, seasoned and then redressed in their original plumage (or filled with the meat of tastier fowl) or even scenes depicting contemporary human activities, such as a knight {{in the form of}} a grilled capon equipped with a paper helmet and lance, sitting on the back of a roast piglet. Elaborate models of castles made from edible material was a popular theme. At a feast in 1343 dedicated to Pope Clement VI, one of the Avignon popes, one of the entremets was a castle with walls made from roast birds, populated with cooked and redressed deer, wild boar, goat, hare and rabbit.|$|E

25|$|This {{effect may}} be {{experienced}} when {{a video of}} one phoneme's production is dubbed with a sound-recording of a different phoneme being spoken. Often, the perceived phoneme is a third, intermediate phoneme. As an example, the syllables /ba-ba/ are spoken over the lip movements of /ga-ga/, and the perception is of /da-da/. McGurk and MacDonald originally believed that this resulted from the common phonetic and visual properties of /b/ and /g/. Two types <b>of</b> <b>illusion</b> in response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli have been observed: fusions ('ba' auditory and 'ga' visual produce 'da') and combinations ('ga' auditory and 'ba' visual produce 'bga'). This is the brain's effort to provide the consciousness with its best guess about the incoming information. The information coming from the eyes and ears is contradictory, and in this instance, the eyes (visual information) have had a greater effect on the brain and thus the fusion and combination responses have been created.|$|E
25|$|Dol Guldur is {{depicted}} in Peter Jackson's 2012-2014 film trilogy adaptation of The Hobbit. The first installment, , shows Dol Guldur as a massive castle in ruins, heavily overgrown with menacing brambles and thorny trees, situated on a hill. It is visited by the wizard Radagast, who has a brief skirmish with {{the shade of the}} Witch-king of Angmar, before encountering the Necromancer and then fleeing to tell Gandalf what he has discovered. The second part of the trilogy, , depicts Gandalf himself entering Dol Guldur, where he discerns that a spell <b>of</b> <b>illusion</b> hangs over the entire fortress, making it appear abandoned even though a growing army of Orcs is amassing there. Gandalf encounters the Necromancer and engages in a magical duel with him, but is ultimately overpowered when the Necromancer unveils his true strength and identity as Sauron. In the third film, , Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman enter Dol Guldur, where they rescue the wounded Gandalf, and battle the Nazgûl. Radagast takes Gandalf out of Dol Guldur to recover, and Galadriel uses her power to force Sauron out of Dol Guldur.|$|E
25|$|By 1916, Einstein {{was able}} to generalize this further, {{to deal with all}} states of motion {{including}} non-uniform acceleration, which became the general theory of relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind <b>of</b> <b>illusion</b> caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time {{in the vicinity of the}} mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the Cosmic microwave background radiation — a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.|$|E
