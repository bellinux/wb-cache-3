Despite the stars' intense mutual dislike, and Fields's very real drinking problems, and fights over the screenplay, My Little Chickadee was a box-office success, outgrossing Fields's previous film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), and the later The Bank Dick (1940).

His attitude toward his work, however, had been changed since he belonged to the last generation of Silpa Bhirasri’s students at Silpakorn University. Thawan got good grades from his drawing works with his drawing works in university all along but he earned a low grade in Silpa’s drawing class.

The truth is that {{this is just one of}} many aspects of a population that are very difficult to measure or even detect. We often talk about macroeconomic quantities (such as the current level of inflation, or economic growth), forgetting that these quantities always refer to the past, since it takes several months to collect, aggregate and analyse the various economic indicators. Measuring the state of a society or an economy in real time is not an easy task. It is a task that certain practitioners call “nowcasting ” [2].

Spike lashes out at Angel, saying that even though Drusilla sired him, it was Angelus who made him a monster, that Angelus just wanted something {{in the world as}} bad as him, and goads Angel about his (Spike's) sexual past with Buffy. In turn, Angel laughs off Spike's claims that Spike is a hero, points out that Angelus simply opened the door to let the real Spike out, and dismisses Spike's past with Buffy, telling Spike [...] "That's why Buffy never really loved you. Because you weren't me." [...] Spike stakes Angel’s shoulder, saying he would have dusted Angel but he doesn’t want to hear Buffy complain. Spike grabs the cup and Angel tells him that it’s not a prize - it’s a burden: [...] "Do you even really want it? <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> it that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want to take something away from me?” “Bit of both,” Spike replies, drinking from the cup.

My character, an African woman named Aminata Diallo whose story is based on this history, has to get into the book before she gets out.In my country, few people have complained to me about the title, and nobody continues to do so after I explain its historical origins. I think it's partly because the word 'Negro' resonates differently in Canada. If you use it in Toronto <b>or</b> Montreal, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> probably <b>just</b> indicating publicly that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> out of touch with how people speak these days.

In {{this part of}} the book, we will explore some of the {{underlying}} tech-nology {{in one of the most}} important aspect of modern systems: how to build distributed systems. Distributed systems have changed the face of the world. When your web browser connects to a web server somewhere else on the planet, it is participating in what seems to be a simple form of a client/server distributed system. When you contact a modern web service such as Google <b>or</b> facebook, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>just</b> interacting with a single machine, however; behind the scenes, these complex ser-vices are built from a large collection (i. e., thousands) of machines, each of which cooperate to provide the particular service of the site. Thus, it should be clear what makes studying distributed systems interesting. Indeed, it is worthy of an entire class; here, we just intro-duce a few of the major topics. A number of new challenges arise when building a distributed system. The major one we focus on is failure; machines, disks, net-works, and software all fail from time to time, as we do not (and likely, will never) know how to build “perfect ” components and sys-tems. However, when we build a modern web service, we’d like it to appear to clients as if it never fails; how can we accomplish this task? Interestingly, while failure is a central challenge in constructing distributed systems, it also represents an opportunity.
