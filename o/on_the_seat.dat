5|$|As Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition, Morton had {{to direct}} the {{campaign}} for the upcoming election in early 1956. At the official campaign launch on 15 February, Morton began by accusing the Cahill government of losing its way and wasting public funds, while promising to invest in public works, education and health. At the election on 3 March 1956, the Liberals gained five seats (Coogee, Drummoyne, Georges River, Parramatta and Sutherland) and the Country Party under Michael Bruxner regained the seat of Armidale, reducing the government's majority from twenty to six. Morton retained Mosman with 78.74%. Although the Coalition had failed to win government, an official report from the Liberal Party State Council blamed the defeat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> redistribution, the abolition of postal voting and the strong right-wing Labor support for Premier Cahill.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Josias Rowley {{was given}} {{command of the}} British {{response}} to the French deployment, a hastily assembled force composed mainly of those ships available at the Cape of Good Hope in early 1809. Ordered to stop the French raiders, Rowley was unable to spread his limited squadron wide enough to pursue the roving French frigates, instead using his forces to blockade and raid the French Indian Ocean islands in anticipation of Hamelin's return. In August 1809, Caroline arrived with her prizes at Saint-Paul on Île Bonaparte and Rowley determined to seize the frigate. He planned a successful invasion of the town, launched on 20 September, 1809, {{which resulted in the}} capture of the port's defences, Caroline and the captured East Indiamen. With his objectives complete, Rowley withdrew five days later. Almost a year later, Rowley returned with a larger task force and made a second landing around the capital of Île Bonaparte, Saint-Denis. Marching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of government, Rowley's troops rapidly overwhelmed the defences and forced the island's garrison to surrender, renaming the island Île Bourbon and installing a British governor.|$|E
5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} was focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% {{of the local}} vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest {{in the south and}} east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{entered the}} Victorian {{parliament}} in 1955, {{and served as}} government whip from 1961 {{until his retirement in}} 1979. At the time of his election, he was the youngest member of parliament, and was given the honour of making the Address-in-Reply, the first speech after opening of the new sitting by the governor, using it to advocate increased lending from the government-owned banks to promote higher levels of home ownership. At the 1958 election, Loxton consolidated his hold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> leading on first preferences (43.67%), and ending with 54.85% of the two party preferred vote to halt Pettiona's attempted comeback. During the election campaign in 1961, a campaign meeting in Prahran that was attended by Premier Bolte and Loxton drew several hundred people and descended into chaos; heckling and some scuffles broke out. At this election, the Liberals' primary vote fell to 41.69% behind the Labor Party's candidate George Gahan 45.29%, and he had to rely on DLP preferences to retain the seat with a reduced two party preferred vote of 52.71%. The Liberals may have been hindered by a how-to-vote card circulated on election day by a third party that had a pro-Liberal headline, but instructed the reader to mark the ALP candidate as their first preference. Loxton managed to secure a court injunction—believed to be {{the first of its kind}} in Victoria—prohibiting further distribution of the material, but not before hundreds of misleading instructions had been disseminated.|$|E

25|$|Weekday farmers (Norwegian: ukedagsbønder, vekedagsbønder) were persons who, as tenants of the noble, had {{a duty to}} work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> farm on weekdays. The system {{came from}} Denmark before 1600. It became most {{widespread}} in Eastern Norway, where the concentration of seat farms was highest, but existed also {{in other parts of}} the Kingdom. From 1685 on, the duty work was limited to farmers who lived within two miles of the seat farm.|$|E
25|$|The penny-farthing is a {{direct-drive}} bicycle, {{meaning the}} cranks and pedals are fixed {{directly to the}} hub. Instead of using gears to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged {{to be close to}} the rider's inseam, to increase the maximum speed. This shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary valve seat as the piston slides into the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E

25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the chair only, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E
25|$|How can the {{accelerating}} frame {{be discovered}} to be non-inertial? In the accelerating frame, everything {{appears to be}} subject to zero net force, and nothing moves. Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> from the car on one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based simply on the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather {{it is based on the}} simplicity of the physical explanation for this compression.|$|E
25|$|A {{chair is}} a piece of {{furniture}} with a raised surface supported by legs, commonly used to seat a single person. Chairs are supported most often by four legs and have a back; however, a chair can have three legs or can have a different shape. Chairs are made {{of a wide variety of}} materials, ranging from wood to metal to synthetic material (e.g. plastic), and they may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics, either just <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> (as with some dining room chairs) or on the entire chair. Chairs are used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces.|$|E

The Twins reinstalled a blue seat back and bottom as well as Puckett's #34 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> where it remained until the final Vikings game of 2013 in the Metrodome when, as local media reported, a fan took the #34 plate off the seat.

25|$|In {{addition}} to helping characterize Halloween, candy pumpkins {{played a role}} in the current U.S. implementation of daylight saving time. Since the 1960s, candy makers had wanted to get the trick-or-treat period covered by Daylight Saving, reasoning that if children have an extra hour of daylight, they would collect more candy. During the 1985 U.S Congressional hearings on Daylight Saving, the industry went so far as to put candy pumpkins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of every senator, hoping to win a little favor. On July 8, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law; it contained a daylight saving rider which continued daylight saving time until the early morning of last Sunday in October; this did not include Halloween night. In 2005, daylight saving time was extended to the first Sunday in November—just long enough to include Halloween.|$|E
25|$|Stalin {{worked into}} the evenings, eating lunch at 4 or 5pm and dinner no earlier than 9pm; other senior {{political}} figures had to accommodate his unusual working patterns. He {{spent much time}} in the Kremlin cinema, where he enjoyed watching films with other high-ranking officials late at night; he had a particular fondness for the Western genre. Stalin enjoyed alcoholic beverages, and at dinner parties and other social events would encourage those around him to join in, hoping that in a drunken state they would reveal secrets. He enjoyed practical jokes, for instance by putting a tomato <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Politburo members and waiting for them to sit on it, and encouraged singing at social events. As an infant, Stalin had displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His dacha in the Moscow suburb of Volynskoe was surrounded by a 50-acre park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities. Stalin was also an accomplished billiards player.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the entry}} into service of the 113 and 114 Series {{throughout}} 2014, a former 20-unit set of the three-car 111 Series trains had run on the line. These trains started operating between 1983 and 1987, and were the line's first modern electrical multiple units. From January 2014 on, a 19-unit set of the four-car 113 Series trains progressively started operating on the Sabadell, Terrassa and Reina Elisenda branches together with the 112 Series. In December of the same year, a 5-unit set of the three-car 114 Series trains started operating on the Avinguda Tibidabo branch, whose station platforms are too short to hold four-car trains such as the 112 and 113 Series. The 113 and 114 Series are identical in both their technical features and design, though they differ {{in the number of}} cars and present some modifications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> layout. After the arrival of the 113 and 114 Series, 111 Series trains were removed from circulation and dismantled. Yet, one unit has been preserved as part of FGC's historical rolling stock.|$|E

The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees {{to stay with him}} forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known.

25|$|On 5 August 2008, two {{pilots and}} seven firefighters {{assigned}} to the Iron Complex fire in California's Shasta-Trinity National Forest, were killed when Carson Helicopters S-61N N612AZ crashed on takeoff. Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional understatement of the helicopter’s empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots’ relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated load-carrying capacity and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address {{the fact that the}} helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a fuel spillage upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate release mechanism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> restraints.|$|E
