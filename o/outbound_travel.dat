40|$|This master's thesis {{analyses}} {{a selection}} of images used to advertise <b>outbound</b> responsible <b>travel</b> to various destinations in Africa. It shows that in the advertisement of the selected destinations colonial imagery and texts are emphasised. Colonial imagery is reproduced in a binary representation model of the "self" and the "other" that not only supports the criticised creation of knowledge of the Global South but also restores racism as an ideology of dominance. To demonstrate this, images and text material are analysed with regard to findings of postcolonial theory. It becomes apparent that contemporary <b>outbound</b> responsible <b>travel</b> agencies continue colonial ideas and power relations. It is thus determined {{that there is a}} gap between the declared aims of responsible tourism agencies and the single-perspective and derogatory meanings the images, they use to advertise their products, carry. Accordingly, recommendations for DMOs (Destination Management Organisations) and decision makers that are involved in the promotion of global travel are developed. Keyword...|$|R

40|$|Mainland China {{experienced}} an extraordinary progress in its {{economy in the}} past two decades which directly stimulates more <b>outbound</b> <b>travels.</b> Considering the geographical proximity and political ties between Hong Kong and Mainland China, the share of inbound tourists to Hong Kong has been, and will continuously be, largely occupied by Mainland Chinese tourists on an uprising basis. The phenomenon of the Chinese tourists' wave, operationalizing as the influx of tourists from Mainland China, has brought tremendous change on Hong Kong's tourism industry, economy and local community. It is, thus, of necessity to understand the perceptions and response toward this phenomenon from local residents' perspective as they are the stakeholders of local tourism. Drawing on the findings from three focus group interviews with 18 Hong Kong residents, three conventional dimensions, namely Economic, Social-cultural and Environmental were identified and discussed to demonstrate the local residents' perceptions toward the impact of Chinese tourists' wave phenomenon. Generally, residents tend to recognize the positive economic impacts as well as negative social-cultural and environmental impacts generated from this tourism phenomenon. The recommendations suggested in this study also serve as a reference for tourism authorities concerned to redress the existing problems. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the decaying effect of distance decay in <b>outbound</b> air <b>travel</b> from Hong Kong. Distance decay theory predicts that demand will peak at some distance relatively close to a source market and then decline exponentially as distance increases. The standard distance decay relationship is predicated on the assumption of a uniform distribution of tourism products over space. However, as discussed in the article, supply is not distributed evenly, with large areas representing Effective Tourism Exclusion Zones (ETEZ). The effect of these tourism exclusion zones is to distort the standard distance decay curve, accelerating decay rates between the source markets and the inner boundary of the ETEZ and producing a concentration of higher demand at points beyond its outer boundary. In addition, for the Hong Kong market, the ETEZ formed a behavioral barrier between short haul and long travel behavior patterns. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
