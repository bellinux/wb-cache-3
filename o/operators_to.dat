5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, {{the phone number}} that was printed {{was that of the}} Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|To finance {{electrification}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century, American financier Charles Yerkes took it over and made it part of his Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) group. Electric propulsion was introduced in 1905, and by the end of the year electric multiple units operated all of the services. On 1 July 1933, the District Railway and the other UERL railways were merged with the Metropolitan Railway and the capital's tramway and bus <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> form the London Passenger Transport Board.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|Commercials {{instructed}} fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, Sports Illustrated for Kids, DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest {{marked the}} first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> submit their own spots, generating 34,000ads among 174cable systems for a total of $3.4million cross-channel media support. 50,000children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received Quest-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, flashlight and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun {{declared}} the entire {{of the country}} excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided tax breaks and allocated ₩1.4trillion (KRW, $1.2billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100billion (KRW, $90million USD) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, {{which led to the}} high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the Kennett Government offered long-distance country rail {{services}} previously {{run by the}} government-owned operator V/Line {{to private}} operators.

5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} {{had gone on}} a fossil-collecting expedition to Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke had discovered the holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted amicably, Marsh secretly bribed the pit <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope by pointing out that his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (or so he claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published the correction shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the typhoon, {{officials}} in China ordered the evacuation of about 2.3million people, mostly in Zhejiang. The typhoon also resulted in the cancellation or delay of thousands of flights, with the two main airports in Shanghai closed for 30hours. Officials near Matsa's projected landfall were advised to lower the levels in reservoirs to mitigate the threat of flooding. In Zhejiang, officials set up shelters for about 35,000 boats to prevent marine damage. Due to the potential for rough seas, officials closed the port at Ningbo and Shanghai and also canceled some ferry service. Matsa was predicted to be first typhoon to affect Beijing in 11years by dropping heavy amounts of rainfall. Local officials advised water <b>operators</b> <b>to</b> lower water levels to prevent flooding. Up to 100mm (4in) of rainfall was forecast for the city, and officials prepared to evacuate 40,000residents in the outskirts of the city.|$|E
