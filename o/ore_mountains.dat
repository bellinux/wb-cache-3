5|$|The {{connection}} with radon gas was first recognized among miners in the <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountains</b> near Schneeberg, Saxony. Silver has been mined there since 1470, and these mines {{are rich in}} uranium, with its accompanying radium and radon gas. Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s. Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the USSR's demand for uranium. Radon was confirmed {{as a cause of}} lung cancer in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} 3,000 years from antiquity {{until the late}} 20thcentury mining of tin and copper played a {{significant}} part in the economy of Cornwall. Cornwall, {{the northern part of}} Iberia and the <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountains</b> (the modern border between the Czech Republic and Germany) are the only places in Europe in which major tin deposits are found near the surface. As tin is an essential ingredient of bronze, Cornwall was of great economic significance in Bronze Age Europe despite its relative isolation. Mining by the Roman Empire led to the Iberian mines becoming depleted by the 3rd centuryAD, leaving Cornwall and neighbouring Devon the most significant sources of tin in Europe. While it appears from surviving evidence that after the decline of the Bronze Age civilisations copper production ceased in Cornwall, it seems that the tin mines were in continuous operation throughout the Roman period and the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Germany, a red mineral {{was found}} in the Erzgebirge (<b>Ore</b> <b>Mountains)</b> that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from {{kupfernickel}} at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.|$|E

Other early reports of pitchblende date from 1727 in Jáchymov and 1763 in Schwarzwald.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{discusses}} the {{changes of the}} cultural landscape and its inhabitants around the <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountain</b> Railway {{during the period of}} industrialization. The goal of a thesis is to describe the changes during the period of industrialization and the influence of newly build <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountain</b> Railway. The <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountain</b> Railway was a significant international transport link furthermore existence of railway had direct influence on the development of small villages in the vicinity. This thesis focuses on villages directly influenced by this railway in the period of industrialization. The first part is devoted to explanation of fundamental terms and description of region. Furthermore, there is a historical description of the region before the period of industrialization. In the next part is stated specific major development of the cultural landscape related to the growth of traffic and industry. In addition, there also describe social changes in the period of industrialization. The major focus of thesis is on the village Hrob. This village is used as an example for explanation of the influence of the <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountain</b> Railway to its region. In the last part is briefly described current state of the <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountain</b> Railway in these days...|$|R

25|$|In April 1759 Frederick led {{his main}} army from Saxony into Lower Silesia {{to keep the}} Russian army in western Poland–Lithuania {{separated}} from Daun's Austrians in Bohemia. Meanwhile, a smaller Prussian force under Prince Henry remained in Saxony to harass Bohemia through the <b>Ore</b> <b>Mountains,</b> winning the Battle of Peterswalde {{and a series of}} other minor engagements, as well as destroying several Austrian ammunition dumps and bridges before retreating into Saxony. The Russians continued to press into Neumark; on 23 July the Russian Count Saltykov led 47,000 men in defeating 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel at the Battle of Kay. However, poor coordination and mistrust between the Russians and Austrians prevented Saltykov and Daun's forces from uniting after the victory. Still, the Russians advanced westward, and on 3 August they reached and occupied Frankfurt an der Oder, where they received some Austrian reinforcements under General Ernst von Laudon.|$|E
