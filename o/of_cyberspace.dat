25|$|Social norms {{can also}} be {{observed}} everywhere people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. Lawrence Lessig describes how social norms can regulate behavior in cyberspace: through an individual's perceptions from the (physical or virtual) surrounding community. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, {{can also be}} applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.|$|E

500|$|The {{works of}} William Gibson {{encompass}} literature, journalism, acting, recitation, and performance art. Primarily renowned as a novelist and short fiction {{writer in the}} cyberpunk milieu, Gibson invented the metaphor <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> in [...] "Burning Chrome" [...] (1982) and emerged from obscurity in 1984 {{with the publication of}} his debut novel Neuromancer. Gibson's early short fiction is recognized as cyberpunk's finest work, effectively renovating the science fiction genre which had been hitherto considered widely insignificant.|$|E

500|$|Gibson {{announced}} the novel on October 6, 2006 on his blog, where {{fragments of the}} work were posted non-sequentially for some time, leading to much reader speculation on the content and plot of the novel. The following day, the blog featured {{an exploration of the}} mooted title by close friend and collaborator Jack Womack. In August 2007, Gibson made an appearance in the virtual world Second Life to give a reading of the novel; later reflecting on the experience, he remarked that the Second Life construct was [...] "a lot more corporate" [...] than he had imagined. A report in The Times described the event as [...] "heavily freighted with meaning" [...] in light of Gibson's role in shaping conceptions <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> and virtual worlds.|$|E
500|$|Spook Country is a 2007 {{novel by}} {{speculative}} fiction [...] author William Gibson. A political thriller set in contemporary North America, it followed {{on from the}} author's previous novel, Pattern Recognition (2003), and was succeeded in 2010 by Zero History, which featured {{much of the same}} core cast of characters. The plot comprises the intersecting tales of three protagonists: Hollis Henry, a musician-turned-journalist researching a story on locative art; Tito, a young Cuban-Chinese operative whose family is on occasion in the employ of a renegade ex-CIA agent; and Milgrim, a drug-addled translator held captive by Brown, a strangely authoritarian and secretive man. Themes explored include the ubiquity of locative technology, the eversion <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> and the political climate of the United States {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E
500|$|The player {{advances}} {{the plot}} by acquiring log discs and e-mails: the game contains no non-player characters {{with which to}} converse. Throughout the game, an evil artificial intelligence called SHODAN hinders the player's progress with traps and blocked pathways. Specific computer terminals allow the player to temporarily enter Cyberspace; inside, the player moves weightlessly through a wire frame 3D environment, while collecting data and fighting SHODAN's security programs. Actions in Cyberspace sometimes cause events in the game's physical world; for example, certain locked doors may only be opened in Cyberspace. Outside <b>of</b> <b>Cyberspace,</b> the player uses the game's sixteen weapons, of which a maximum of seven may be carried at one time, to combat robots, cyborgs and mutants controlled by SHODAN. Projectile weapons often have selectable ammunition types with varying effects; for example, the [...] "dart pistol" [...] may fire either explosive needles or tranquilizers. Energy weapons and several types of explosives may also be found, with the latter ranging from percussion grenades to land mines.|$|E

50|$|The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace {{identifies}} three strategic objectives: (1) Prevent cyber {{attacks against}} America's critical infrastructures; (2) Reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks; and (3) Minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks that do occur. To meet these objectives, the National Strategy outlines five national priorities: The first priority, the creation <b>of</b> a National <b>Cyberspace</b> Security Response System, focuses on improving the government’s response to cyberspace security incidents {{and reducing the}} potential damage from such events. The second, third, and fourth priorities (the development <b>of</b> a National <b>Cyberspace</b> Security Threat and Vulnerability Reduction Program, the creation <b>of</b> a National <b>Cyberspace</b> Security Awareness and Training Program, the necessity <b>of</b> Securing Governments' <b>Cyberspace)</b> aim to reduce threats from, and vulnerabilities to, cyber attacks. The fifth priority, {{the establishment of a}} system of National Security and International Cyberspace Security Cooperation, intends to prevent cyber attacks that could impact national security assets and to improve the international management of and response to such attacks.|$|R

500|$|The game {{sold over}} 170,000 copies. Maximum PC {{believed}} that the game did not reach [...] "blockbuster" [...] status, but was successful enough to [...] "keep Looking Glass afloat". GameSpy's Bill Hiles said, [...] "Though it sold well, it never reached the frenzied popularity of [...] ". Paul Neurath later said that the game [...] "was not a flop", but that it ultimately [...] "lost money" [...] for the company, which he attributed to its steep learning curve. Computer Gaming World praised the game's scale, physics system, and true 3D environments; the magazine extolled the presentation <b>of</b> <b>Cyberspace</b> as [...] "nothing short of phenomenal". However, the reviewer {{believed that the}} game had [...] "little sense of urgency" [...] and [...] "confusing level layouts". Computer Shopper wrote that, while the game's controls were difficult to master compared to [...] "simple run-and-shoot game like Doom", they were [...] "worth the time and effort". The reviewer noted that the game [...] "grows on you, and it will keep you intrigued for weeks".|$|E
500|$|Observers {{contend that}} Gibson's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream. Gibson introduced, in Neuromancer, the notion of the [...] "meatpuppet", and is credited with inventing—conceptually rather than participatorally—the phenomenon of virtual sex. His influence on early pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged, and he holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design. Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the [...] "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking [...] "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?" ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Park {{singled out}} the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that [...] "entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's {{gift for the}} terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile – people and {{products}} are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, is {{that much of the}} flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> seems to fit perfectly, now, on all kinds of things." [...] In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that [...] "ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book...." [...] Simon Cooper of The Book Show agreed with the commendations of Gibson's prose, but felt the plot and characterization let the book down: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the revised and updated 2003 edition of the book, Law Library Journal wrote, [...] "Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age is a book that can help the uninitiated become {{familiar}} with the issues and arguments that have shaped the debate over regulating cyberspace." [...] The review noted, [...] "Cyber Rights was inspired by Godwin's unwavering belief that an uncensored Internet can transform society into a true democracy. It is an exceptionally personal work and resembles an online journal. ... The book, written in the first person, has a casual and conversational style. As the reader is able to 'hear' the author's voice, Cyber Rights is extremely easy to read." [...] Law Library Journal criticized the book for being repetitive, and for dismissing arguments of his opponents as [...] "an irrational fear of the unknown (i.e., cyberspace) or as a poor understanding of case law or the Framers' intent". The review acknowledged, [...] "Cyber Rights is a good introduction to the world <b>of</b> <b>cyberspace</b> and the legal issues that affect the Internet. It presents, in a readable style, a passionate perspective on an emerging area of law." [...] Law Library Journal recommended the book for [...] "large academic law libraries".|$|E
