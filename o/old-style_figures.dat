50|$|This is {{a version}} of the {{original}} Frutiger font family licensed to Microsoft. This family consists of Frutiger 55, 56, 65, and 66. It does not include OpenType features or kerning, but it adds support to Latin Extended-B and Greek characters, with Frutiger 55 supporting extra IPA characters and spacing modifier letters. Unlike most Frutiger variants, Frutiger Linotype features <b>old-style</b> <b>figures</b> as the default numeral style.|$|E
50|$|Because of its popularity, a new Charter Pro {{release of}} the {{typeface}} was released in 2004, with an expanded character set including additional symbols, ranging <b>figures</b> (<b>old-style)</b> and small capitals. This version was later added as a system font on OS X.|$|R
5000|$|The numerals used by Western {{countries}} have two forms: lining ("in-line" [...] or [...] "full-height") figures as {{seen on a}} typewriter and taught in North America, and <b>old-style</b> <b>figures,</b> in which numerals 0, 1, and 2 are at x-height; numerals 6 and 8 have bowls within x-height, and ascenders; numerals 3, 5, 7, and 9 have descenders from x-height; and the numeral 4 rests along the baseline.|$|E

Released in 1999 by Neufville Digital - a joint venture of Fundición Tipográfica Bauer SL and Visualogik Technology & Design b.v - it includes small capitals and the <b>old-style</b> <b>figures</b> that had not been made in metal types. The redesign was done by Marie-Therésè Koreman.|$|E
50|$|Despite its clean {{geometric}} appearance, some of Futura's design choices recalled classic serif typefaces. Unlike many sans-serif designs {{intended for}} display purposes, Futura {{has quite a}} low x-height, reducing its stridency and increasing its suitability for body text. The original Futura design concept included small capitals and <b>old-style</b> <b>figures.</b> These were dropped from the original metal issue of the type and first offered digitally by Neufville Digital under the Futura ND family; small caps are also available in the URW++ digitisation.|$|E
5000|$|Lydian is a {{typeface}} {{designed by}} Warren Chappell for American Type Founders in 1938. While the stressed letter designs (most {{notably in the}} rounded capitals C, G, O, and Q) suggest a calligraphic style, this is considered a sans-serif font. It is available in bold, italic, and condensed, {{as well as a}} Cursive variant. The original foundry font was commissioned and cast by American Type Founders and included an alternate capital A with a cross bar and the original italic used <b>old-style</b> <b>figures</b> for numerals. The various members of the family were introduced over the course of eight years: ...|$|E
