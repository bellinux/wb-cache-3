40|$|ABSTRACT. Many guyots in {{the north}} Pacific are built of drowned Cretaceous shallow-water carbonates that rest on edifice basalt. Dating of these limestones, using strontium- and carbon-isotope stratigraphy, {{illustrates}} a number {{of events in the}} evolution of these carbonate platforms: local deposition of marine black shales during the early Aptian oceanic anoxic event; synchronous development of <b>oolitic</b> <b>deposits</b> during the Aptian; and drowning at different times during the Cretaceous (and Tertiary). Dating the youngest levels of these platform carbonate shows that the shallow-water systems drowned sequentially in the order in which plate-tectonic movement transported them into low latitudes south of the Equator (paleolati-tude 0 °- 10 ° south).

Dating the youngest levels of these platform carbonate shows that the shallow-water systems drowned sequentially in the order in which plate-tectonic movement transported them into low latitudes south of the Equator (paleolatitude ∼ 0 °- 10 ° south). The chemistry of peri-equatorial waters, rich in upwelled nutrients and carbon dioxide, may have been a contributory factor to the suppression of carbonate precipitation on these platforms. However, oceanic anoxic events, thought to reflect high nutrient availability and increased productivity of planktonic organic-walled and siliceous microfossils, did not occasion platform drowning. Neither is there any evidence that relative sealevel changes were the primary cause of platform drowning, which is consistent with the established resilience of shallow-water carbonate systems when influenced by such phenomena. Comparisons with paleotemperature data show that platform drowning took place closer to the Equator during cooler intervals, such as the early Albian and Maastrichtian, and farther south of the Equator during warmer periods such as Albian-Cenomaniain boundary time and the mid-Eocene. Initiation of one carbonate platform relatively close to the Equator, at paleolatitudes more northerly than those where others drowned, took place during the cool early mid-Aptian. These correlations are in accord with an interpretation that excess warmth in shallow peri-equatorial waters proved inimical for many carbonate-secreting organisms living on the platforms, allowing subsidence or eustatic sealevel rise to outpace sedimentation and guyots to form. A parallel may be drawn with the recent phenomenon of coral and foraminiferal bleaching, whereby photosynthetic symbionts succumb to prolonged high temperatures (> 30 °C) and the host organism dies. The fact that most Cretaceous guyots reside {{in the north}} Pacific may not be solely related to the age-distribution pattern of ocean floor but to their having run the gauntlet of a difficult and dangerous passage across the Equator. North Pacific guyots are relics from the Cretaceous (and Eocene) "greenhouse" Earth...|$|R
40|$|We present {{detailed}} bathymetry, {{remotely operated}} vehicle (ROV) and submersible observations, and sedimentary and radiocarbon age data from carbonate deposits recovered from two submerged terraces at − 150 m (T 1) and − 230 m (T 2) off Lanai, Hawaii. The tops of the terraces are veneered by relatively thin (< 5 m) in situ accumulations of coralline algal nodule, coralgal nodule, Halimeda and a derived <b>oolitic</b> facies <b>deposited</b> in intermediate (30 – 60 m) to deep fore-reef slope settings (60 – 120 m). The data are used to develop a sedimentary facies model {{that is consistent with}} eustatic sea-level variations over the last 30 ka. Both nodule facies on T 1 and T 2 initiated growth 30 – 29 ka following a fall in sea level of not, vert, similar 50 m and increase in bottom currents during the transition from Marine Isotope Stage 3 to 2. The nodules accreted slowly throughout the Last Glacial Maximum when sea-level was relatively stable. Drowning occurred during the early deglaciation (17 – 16 ka) and was marked by the complete drowning of coralline algal nodules facies on T 2 and incipient drowning of coralgal facies on T 1. Abrupt sea-level rise during the middle deglaciation, perhaps associated with global meltwater pulse 1 A (14 – 15 ka), finally drowned the coralgal facies on T 1, which in turn was overlain by a deep-water Halimeda facies or an oolitic facies derived from upslope. Our data indicates that Lanai has experienced relatively little vertical tectonic movement over the last 30 ka. Using paleobathymetric data derived from the sedimentary facies, age vs. depth relationships, and published sea-level curves, we estimate that Lanai could be either slowly uplifting or subsiding, but at rates < 0. 1 m/kyr (uplift) or < 0. 4 m/kyr (subsidence) over this 30 kyr period...|$|R
40|$|The last marine Jurassic unit {{deposited}} in the Soria area corresponds to the Torrecilla en Cameros Fm. (Early Kimmeridgian). This unit, composed of sandstones and reefal and <b>oolitic</b> limestones, was <b>deposited</b> in a shallow carbonate ramp. The synsedimentary diagenetic processes of micritization and precipitation of peloidal micrite and fibrous calcite occurred during the episode of sedimentation. In the Late Kimmeridgian the reefal unit was subaerial exposed and was affected by the meteoric waters {{which led to the}} dissolution and neomorphism of aragonite and HMC and the precipitation of a generation of meteoric calcite. The top of the unit was also edaphized and a ferruginous crust was developed. The episode of rifting, that {{led to the formation of}} the Cameros Basin, occurred from the Tithonian and during the Early Cretaceous. In this sector, the sedimentation of the basin, mainly continental, started with the deposition of the Ágreda Aloformation. Carbonates deposited of the base of this continental unit have elemental and isotopic features very similar to those of the meteoric cements precipitated in the reefal unit. This suggests that the environmental conditions were very similar during precipitation of meteoric carbonates in both units. With the progressive burial, precipitation of a ferroan calcite cement occurred in fractures and remaining porosity in both units. Later, a generation of saddle ankerite precipitated, perhaps in relation to the hydrothermal metamorphism that affected the northeastern sector of the basin during the Middle-Late Cretaceous. Lastly, the precipitation of a generation of nonferroan and Mg-rich calcite cement occurred, possibly during the Latest Cretaceous. The last preserved diagenetic stages were related to the tectonic uplift of the region during the alpine compression, and the exhumation of the reefal unit during which ankerite and ferroan calcite were replaced by nonferroan, inclusion rich calcite...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the petrology, geochemistry, and palaeoecology {{of the west}} Sicilian Jurassic deposits and, where possible, compares them to similar facies elsewhere in the Alpine-Mediterranean region. The Liassic platform carbonates form the greatest part of the west Sicilian Jurassic in terms of thickness these {{are a series of}} white limestones and dolomites whose shallow-water origin is suggested by the presence of such structures as Stromatactis, birdseyes, and shrinkage cracks - and the component lithologies which include pelletal, oolitic and stromatolitic facies. The modern Bahamian pattern of sedimentation compares well with the reconstructed depositional environment of these rocks. Crinoidal limestones, which cap the Liassic platform carbonates, usually occur as discontinuous lenses, and these are interpreted as sand-waves deposited on oceanic seamounts - seamounts which were formed after the carbonate platform had disintegrated during the Lias. The Toarcian iron pisolites, which may also cap the white Liassic limestones, are considered to result from volcanic emanations that accompanied this disintegration. Fossil manganese nodules, which occur in condensed sequences of Middle Jurassic age, have been subject to detailed investigation, and these ancient concretions are comparable in their structure, mineralogy and geochemistry to Recent oceanic iron-manganese accumulations. The condensed sequences themselves - like the crinoidal calc-arenites and the iron pisolites - are interpreted as seamount deposits formed as the presence of stromatolites, boring algae and herbivorous gastropods suggests, in shallow photic zones. Seamount evolution in the Upper Jurassic followed two patterns: the seamounts either sank with the consequent formation of more basinal deposits such as red nodular limestones and radiolarites, or with possible uplift, were the site of more massive carbonate production, with the formation of <b>oolitic</b> and pelletal <b>deposits.</b> Finally, in the Tithonian and extending into the Neocomian, a more uniformly basinal coccolith ooze covered much of the area...|$|R
40|$|The Loppio Oolitic Limestone is a {{lithostratigraphic unit}} of the Early Jurassic Trento Platform in the Southern Alps, Northern Italy, which {{deposited}} over an area of ca. 3500 km 2. It appears as a roughly tabular or wedge-shaped sedimentary body with thickness gradually increasing from 0 to ca. 100 m toward the western platform margin. We investigated the sedimentology, petrography and bulk carbonate carbon isotope geochemistry of the Loppio Oolitic Limestone in order {{to shed light on}} its depositional setting and origin. The Loppio Oolitic Limestone is made almost exclusively of oolitic grainstone, and can be subdivided in two parts. In the lower part, ooids are poorly sorted and sedimentary structures are scarce or absent. In the upper part, sorting becomes good and sedimentary structures are common. The vertical succession of sedimentary structures and the upward increase in sorting suggest a shallowing upward trend within the oolite. A reddened surface, meteoric cements and dinosaur footprints occur {{at the top of the}} unit, testifying for a subaerial exposure which is also confirmed by carbon and oxygen stable isotopic data. In terms of sequence stratigraphy, the Loppio Oolitic Limestone represents a Highstand Systems Tract, bounded at the top by a subaerial exposure surface. Bulk carbonate stable carbon isotope curves across the Loppio Oolitic Limestone from 7 stratigraphic sections could be correlated over distances of tens of km on the whole Trento Platform. This correlation suggests that the deposition of ooids was nearly synchronous across the platform. A negative excursion of carbon isotopes with magnitude of ca. 1 ‰ VPDB was identified within a lime mudstone unit (“Nodular lithozone” of the Monte Zugna Formation) immediately below the Loppio Oolitic Limestone, which can be correlated to a global perturbation of the carbon cycle in the mid-Sinemurian. The flooding of a wide area of formerly peritidal carbonate platform below the wave base was interpreted as due to an ecological crisis that caused a drop of carbonate production. We suggest that the subsequent recovery of carbonate production is marked by the shallowing upward succession of the Loppio Oolitic Limestone, which quickly occupied the accommodation space formed in consequence of the crisis, thus preventing the platform drowning. The Loppio <b>Oolitic</b> Limestone <b>deposited</b> as an initially highly porous oolitic sand that was then topped by a clayey interval (base of the Rotzo Formation), giving origin to a structural and stratigraphic configuration that could be favourable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons in the subsurface. The recurrence of similar facies superpositions, formed in consequence of perturbations of the carbon cycle with documented climatic effects, is discussed with regard to the Tethysian record of Mesozoic carbonate platforms. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
40|$|The Lower Muschelkalk crops {{out in the}} Catalan Coastal Ranges (the Catalan Basin) {{and eastern}} Iberian Ranges (the Valencia-Cuenca Basin) and occurs {{extensively}} in the subsurface of the Ebro Basin. The Lower Muschelkalk forms a carbonate platform that was deposited on red Buntsandstein siliciclastics and locally-developed evaporitic and calcareous shales. The Middle Muschelkalk rests with a sharp contact on the underlying Lower Muschelkalk and in contrast to it, exhibits marked regional thickness and facies variations. The Triassic of northeast Spain generally subsided during the Mesozoic and was uplifted during the early Paleogene. Tertiary subsidence was important in the Ebro Basin and the Neogene basins of the Catalan Coastal Ranges. The Lower Muschelkalk has a maximum thickness of about l(X) m in the Catalan Basin and southeastern Valencia-Cuenca Basin, but thins towards the northwest before pinching out completely. The {{lower part of the}} Lower Muschelkalk consists of peri tidal carbonates (El Brull Unit) passing upwards into bioclastic lagoonal sediments (Olesa Unit) and lagoonal to <b>oolitic</b> sand-belt <b>deposits</b> (Vilella Baixa Unit) interpreted as broadly transgressive sediments deposited on a homoclinal ramp which form a Transgressive Systems Tract (TST). The TST is overlain by locally-developed shallow subtidal to intertidal deposits and by intertidal to supra tidal dolomicrites (Lower Member and Upper Member of the Colldejou Unit). This aggradational to retrogradational package constitute a Highstand Systems Tract (HST). The Olesa Unit and Vilella Baixa Unit pinch out towards the northwest of the Valencia-Cuenca Basin and the Ebro Basin and the succession becomes dominated by peri tidal sediments. Lateral facies changes in the Olesa Unit and Vilella Baixa Unit indicate a downramp transition from northeast to southwest of the Catalan Basin. Paleokarstic surfaces are locally important in the Vilella Baixa Unit and the Lower Member of the Colldejou Unit and the underlying sediments appear to have been subjected to meteoric stabilization with early aragonite dissolution and replacement. These horizons have locally resisted later dolomitization. Subsurface paleokarsts are locally important in the Catalan Basin and may be related to Paleogene uplift and intraformational dissolution. Sulphates and evidence of former sulphates are common in the Lower Muschelkalk. Most sulphates were syndepositional but others were related to shallow-burial fabric-replacive dolomitization. Sulphate dissolution occurred in two phases; during burial diagenesis related to hydro thermal fluids; and in association with uplift into meteoric phreatic and vadose environments when dolomites suffered calcitization. Three types of dolomite are recognised in the Lower Muschelkalk: peritidal dolomite occurring in the Upper Member of the Colldejou Unit and in the peritidal facies of the El Brull Unit; fabric-replacive dolomite occurring in the TST; and baroque dolomite as a late cement and locally mosaic-forming phase. Trace element and isotope geochemistry indicates consistently greater depletion in strontium and (^ 18) O in the fabric-replacive dolomite than in the peritidal dolomite and differing trends in iron and manganese. These features are consistent with downwards-migrating fluids acting on contrasting precursors. The fabric-replacive dolomite and peritidal dolomite are considered to have formed as a result of Middle Muschelkalk evaporite-related brines migrating downwards through relatively homogeneous, unstable aragonite-rich peritidal sediments of the Colldejou Unit into more heterogeneous, partially stabilised calcitic limestones of the TST. Sequence stratigraphy allows easy comparison with other similar brine-reflux models of dolomitization. The baroque dolomite is geochemically distinct with depleted δ(^ 18) O values and high iron and manganese contents indicating precipitation at elevated temperatures from reducing fluids associated with local hydrothermal mineralization. Calcitization has locally affected the Lower Muschelkalk dolomites producing a wide variety of fabrics. Geochemistry and petrography indicate that dedolomitic calcite formed as a result of uplift- related dissolution of sulphates by near-surface, soil-influenced meteoric-derived groundwaters...|$|R
40|$|Mined since prehistoric times, oolitic ironstones (OIS) {{were a very}} {{important}} world source of iron from 1850 to 1945 : hereafter they have been progressively replaced by the Precambrian Banded Iron- Formations (BIF). OIS are iron-rich sedimentary rocks bearing ferruginous ooids. They consist of at least 15 % iron. In Western Europe, their overall depositional environment {{is that of a}} shallow shelf, most often located close to the transition from non-marine to marine environments. Their main age range is concentrated within the Ordovician through Devonian and the Jurassic through Paleogene. Proterozoic occurrences are known but these occur outside Europe. The host rocks of the ironstones are predominantly clastic, whereas the host sediment of the ferruginous ooids can be either clastic or carbonate or both. The OIS occur at the top of coarsening and shoaling upward cycles. They represent condensed deposits and transgressive system tracts. Numerous <b>oolitic</b> ironstone <b>deposits</b> are interpreted as tempestites or as intertidal deposits. It is generally agreed that ferruginous ooids formed in shallow marine water conditions, near the water-sediment interface, with repeated reworking of the sediment. Such an environment implies oxidizing conditions, the sedimentary iron being in the ferric state. The exact source of the iron is still a matter of discussion and speculation, just as the primary or secondary origin of the ferruginous ooids. Besides hematite (or goethite), also siderite, Fe-dolomite and berthierine/chamosite are present in the OIS as iron-bearing minerals. Due to weathering processes the carbonate matrix is often removed, the iron is released and oxidized, whereas the ferrous silicates are converted into ferric oxides or ferric hydroxides. Many old mining activities are based on occurrences of this weathered ore. The latter material has also strong staining properties. 1. Germany OIS are outcropping in the Eifel area. The latter is part of the Ardenno-Rhenish Massif and lies in the eastern extension of the Neufchateau Synclinorium, south of the Ardenne Anticlinorium (enclosing the Cambro-Ordovician Stavelot-Venn inlier). The general structure of the Eifel corresponds to an intensively folded and faulted synclinorium In the center of this synclinorium, outcrops of OIS occur on both flanks of successive synclines that are individually named (from the north to the south) : the Sötenicher Mulde, the Blankenheimer Mulde the Rohrer Mulde, the Dollendorfer Mulde, the Ahrdorfer Mulde and the Hillesheimer Mulde. Two important stratigraphic levels with IOS are known and they coincide more or less with the Lower-Middle Devonian boundary (Uppermost Emsian- Lowermost Eifelian). These OIS represent excellent marker beds for geological mapping. 2. The Netherlands There is no outcrop of OIS in this country. 3. Belgium Oolitic iron ores were formed during different periods in Belgium: the Lochkovian (Lower Devonian, Dinant Synclinorium, restricted to the Belgian-French border), the Givetian (Middle Devonian, Dinant Synclinorium), the Frasnian (Upper Devonian, Dinant Synclinorium), the Famennian (Upper Devonian, Namur S., Dinant S. & Vesdre S.) and the Toarcian-Aalenian (Jurassic, Lorraine area, Paris Basin – called “minette ore”). The most important OIS level is the Lower Famennian one. It has been intensively mined until the middle of the 20 th century, essentially in the Namur Synclinorium, between the cities of Namur and Huy. In this area, its important thickness (until 1. 85 m) and the number of layers triggered the development of an important economic activity. Outcrops were restricted to the tributaries of the Meuse River. The Famennian oolitic ironstone facies change from north to south by a gradual {{decrease in the number of}} layers, in their thickness, grain size, ooid concentration, clast size and iron content. They represent also excellent lithostratigraphical marker beds. The clay-dolomitic matrix is being progressively replaced by a calcitic cement. The other Devonian OIS levels are not of great economic importance, they were only mined locally, to supply smith’s working places. Due to surface mining, outcrops are now very rare, and often indicated by a light depression in the topography only. 4. Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg OIS are restricted to the Jurassic (Aalenian-Lower Bajocian) in the NW part of the Paris Basin. This essentially goethitic ore (“minette”) was intensively mined in the three adjacent country borders area (FR-BE-LU). No OIS levels in the Lower Devonian are outcropping in the northern part of the Grand Duchy. 5. France Numerous OIS layers are known in France at several stratigraphical levels, but a lot of them cannot be considered as a real ore. Paleozoic OIS belonging to the Armorican Massif were mined in the Normandy area (Urville Fm, Llanvirn, Middle Ordovician) and in the Bretagne area (Arenig, Lower Ordovician). In Normandy, OIS do outcrop inside several synclines (e. g. May and Urville Sy.), as one thick composite layer.   The spatial relationships of the different oolitic ironstone levels with the Linienbandkeramik settlements (LBK) in the studied area, will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The western Snake River Plain is a Neogene-aged intracontinental rift basin, about 70 km {{wide and}} 300 km long, {{trending}} northwest across the southern Idaho batholith. Its southeastern end merges with the northeast-trending eastern plain, a structural downwarp associated with extension along the {{track of the}} Yellowstone hot spot. Orientation of the western plain rift is parallel to several regional northwest-trending crustal discontinuities, such as the Olympic-Wallowa lineament and the Brothers fault zone, suggesting that the rift failed along zones of lithospheric weakness, as the lithosphere was softened by the passing hot spot. Crustal refraction data and gravity show that the rift is not simply underlain by granitic rock, despite its appearance of having broken and extended {{the southern end of}} the Idaho batholith. Instead, the crust beneath 1 to 2 km of basin fill is mostly of mafic composition down to the top of the mantle, about 42 km deep beneath the plain. North and south of the plain, the upper crust has velocities more typical of granitic rock. South of the plain, beneath the 9 - 11 Ma Bruneau-Jarbidge eruptive center of silicic volcanics, is a zone of slightly high seismic velocity at a depth of 23 km that could be restite or an underplate of basalt related to formation of the silicic magma. In this paper we show that some (12 - 10 Ma) rhyolite flows and domes erupted near the margins of the plain, but that thick rhyolite does not occur in deep wells in the subsurface of the plain northwest of Boise. For this reason, we suspect that much of the area of the plain was an upland and not a large depositional basin during the period of silicic volcanism. Geochronology of volcanic rocks on both sides indicate major faulting began about 11 Ma and was largely finished by 9 Ma. Since about 9 Ma, slip rates have been low (less than 0. 01 mm/year) with the exception of a short (about 10 -km) segment of late Quaternary faulting in the Halfway Gulch-Little Jacks Creek area on the south side. Earliest sediment of the plain is associated with basalt volcanism and high rates of faulting. Interbedded arkose, mudstone, and volcanic ash constitute this earliest sediment mapped as the Chalk Hills Formation. Local basalt lava fields (dated 10 - 7 Ma) occur at several levels in the Chalk Hills Formation. An active rift environment is envisioned with lakes interconnected at times by a river system. The faulted and tilted Chalk Hills Formation is dissected by an erosion surface at the basin margins, indicating a regression of lakes to the deeper basins. Depositional records of the regression are generally absent from the margins, but we suggest that the east Boise fan aquifer sediments and deep basin fill might be such a record. Nothing is known of the cause of the regression of the Chalk Hills lake. A transgressive lacustrine sequence encroached over slightly deformed and eroded Chalk Hills Formation on the plain margins, locally leaving basal coarse sand, or a thin beach pebble layer now iron-oxide cemented. The upper part of this transgression <b>deposited</b> shoreline <b>oolitic</b> sand <b>deposits,</b> indicating increased alkalinity of a closed lake. In the Boise foothills, much of the exposed sediment appears to be this transgressive lacustrine sequence where it is mapped as the Terteling Springs Formation, with shoreline sands and small deltas interfingering basinward with lake muds. The lake rose to its highest elevation of about 3, 600 feet (1, 100 m) in a period of less than a few million years. At that highest level, it overtopped the spill point into ancestral Hell’s Canyon and the Columbia-Salmon river drainage. Reliable geochronology constrains the time of overflow between 6. 4 and 1. 7 Ma and is in need of better resolution. The rise in lake level may have been indirectly caused by regional tectonic movement of the migrating uplift of the Yellowstone hot spot, as an associated Continental Divide migrated about 200 km eastward from the Arco area to its position in Yellowstone National Park over the period 6 Ma to present. In doing so, the catchment area of the Snake River may have increased as much as 50, 000 square km. Captured runoff associated with the shifting topographic divide is hypothesized to have caused the level of Lake Idaho to rise to its spill point about 4 million years ago. Downcutting of the outlet was apparently slow (about 120 m/Ma) during which time sandy sediment eroded from the basin margins and filled the remaining lake basin with interbedded mud and sand of lacustrine delta systems. This sedimentary sequence of a slowly lowering base level constitutes most of the Glenns Ferry Formation and the main sand-bearing aquifer section of the western plain. It is represented in the Boise foothills by a 60 -m-thick unit of coarse sand with Gilbert-type foreset bedding called the Pierce Park sand. Subsequently, fluvial systems with gradients necessary to produce braid-plain sandy gravel deposits flowed to the outlet region near Weiser. These gravel deposits should decrease in age and altitude to the northwest, and at Weiser these oldest gravels occur at elevation 2, 500 feet. During the late stages of the draining of Lake Idaho, basalt volcanism resumed in the western plain, focusing along a line of vents that trends obliquely across the plain at about N. 70 º W., named here the Kuna-Mountain Home volcanic rift. Both sublacustrine and subaerial volcanoes erupted and built a basalt upland with elevations of highest shields to 3, 600 feet over the last 2. 2 million years. Aligned vents and fissures of these volcanoes indicate the present orientation of the principal tectonic stress is N. 70 º W., contrasting with the N. 45 º W. boundary of the plain and the N. 30 º W. alignment of vents in the eastern plain. This N. 70 º W. alignment is similar to the same vent features of Quaternary basalt fields in eastern Oregon, suggesting that a province of similar tectonic stress orientation includes the western plain and much of eastern Oregon...|$|R
