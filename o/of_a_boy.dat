5|$|John Rice, a boy actor {{with the}} King's Men, {{may have played}} Lady Macbeth in a {{performance}} of what was likely Shakespeare's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611.

His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on the same subject by another dramatist. The role may have been beyond the talents <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> actor {{and may have been}} played by a man in early performances.|$|E

5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} the birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> twice as much {{and there is some}} evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E

Two drama CDs based on the series were also released. Set in 19th-century England, the series focuses on a young earl named Cain Hargreaves who solves murders while encountering his father's secret organization, Delilah, that experiments with reviving the dead.|$|E
5|$|Eclogue 4, {{also known}} as the Fourth Eclogue is the name of a Latin poem by the Roman poet Virgil. Part of his first major work, the Eclogues, the piece was written around 40 BC, during a time of {{temporary}} stability following the Treaty of Brundisium; it was later published in and around the years 39–38 BC. The work describes the birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> a supposed savior, who once of age will become divine and eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire emerged to view Virgil as a virtuous pagan, and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor Constantine, early Christian theologian Lactantius, and St. Augustineto varying degreesreinterpreted the poem to be about the birth of Jesus Christ.|$|E

5|$|Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

5|$|When Martin {{was between}} Hollywood {{projects}} {{in the summer of}} 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called Avalon. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of A Game of Thrones. Putting Avalon aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that {{it was part of a}} longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series Doorways that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital {{punishment}} was not applicable to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. {{if there were no}} male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue.
