Because the modern film became an invention and industry only in the late nineteenth century, a generation <b>of</b> simply created <b>films</b> by self investigative producers and directors existed significantly before the academic analysis that followed in later generations.|$|R

5|$|Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{as part of}} a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called 'heritage cinema': period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France.

Berri's pair <b>of</b> <b>films</b> stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.|$|E
