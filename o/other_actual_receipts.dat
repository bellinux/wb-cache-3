40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that child support receipts deter mothers' labor supply less than does other non-wage income. This paper argues that because child support is a variable income source, <b>actual</b> <b>receipts</b> may differ from unobservable permanent receipts on which hours worked are based. This introduces an errors-in-variables bias causing the estimated income effect of child support on hours worked to be biased toward zero. When one replaces <b>actual</b> <b>receipts</b> with predicted permanent receipts, such income effect is found to be statistically indistinguishable from that of other non-wage income.

Our current study is one of several recent efforts to improve understanding and usefulness of survey data matched to individual-level benefit records, and it is the first one involving actual payment histories from the Social Security Administration’s (SSA’s) Payment History Update System (PHUS) for Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI). The SSA administrative records have been matched to the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In analyzing these matched data for elderly and working-age beneficiaries, we seek to identify specific factors primarily responsible for survey error and to assess the relevance of survey error for a range of different analytic objectives.

40|$|Background: Prognostic {{disclosure}} {{is a show}} {{of respect}} for patient autonomy. Only patients who are aware of their prognosis can participate in discussions about their medical condition and make decisions that meet their individual preferences. Despite the abundant literature on this topic, no systematic estimates of prognostic disclosure in cancer patients are available and relatively little {{research has focused on}} the impact of prognostic awareness and disclosure on cancer patients. Methods: The literature on prognostic awareness and disclosure in cancer patients was systematically reviewed and subjected to a meta-analysis. Results: The literature search retrieved 25 articles for meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of preferences for prognostic information and prognostic disclosure was calculated. Most cancer patients expressed a preference for prognostic disclosure [84. 6 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 74. 1 %- 91. 4 %) ], but only about half were told their prognosis (49. 3 %, 95 % CI 36. 4 %- 62. 3 %). These results indicate a gap between cancer patients’ preferences for prognostic disclosure and their <b>actual</b> <b>receipt</b> of prognosis. Cancer patients who are not told their prognosis may have several negative consequences, including inappropriate prognostic awareness, receiving futile treatment at the end of life, being unprepared for death, increased psychological and mental distress as well as social and spiritual suffering, and decreased quality of life. The discrepancy between patients’ preferred and actual prognostic disclosure is primarily due to physicians’ difficulty in revealing the prognosis; this difficulty stems from inaccurate estimates of prognosis, attitudes of beneficence and maintaining patients’ hope, lack of good communication skills, and not knowing patients’ preferences for prognostic information. Conclusions: In order to close the gap between patients’ preferences for prognostic disclosure and <b>actual</b> <b>receipt</b> of prognostic information, healthcare professionals should develop interventions to overcome the physicians’ difficulty in revealing prognosis, thus facilitating cancer patients’ awareness of prognosis and providing high quality end-of-life care...|$|R

Using data from a daily diary study of support provision and receipt in couples, the authors show that many transactions reported by supporters are not reported by recipients. They also show that these invisible support transactions promote adjustment to a major stressor. It is now well established that perceptions of social support availability predict better adjustment to stressful events (Cohen...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{revenues of}} water right transactions can be substantial in theory, but the <b>actual</b> <b>receipts</b> are generally limited in practice. This difference {{is attributable to}} the presence of other factors influencing the operation of water markets. In this paper, we study the discriminatory-price and the uniform-price sealed-bid procurement auction for divisible items in water right trade wherein commissions define the costs of transactions. We further analyze the quantitative relationships between transaction costs and the revenues of sellers, buyers, and of the auction site. The findings indicate that transaction costs do not affect the margins of bidders because of reluctance to raise quotations. The bidders bear the commissions but impose the transaction costs outwardly on the seller who as a result suffers from reduced revenues. Of the two types the uniform-price auction generates more revenue for sellers than the discriminatory-price auction. 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
