Mid-January 1918 found the battleship back at New York preparing for the voyage across the Atlantic, including the removal of two more 5-inch guns, reducing the total number aboard to 16.

5|$|In the Antarctic, {{species were}} found in the South Shetland Islands, South <b>Orkney</b> <b>Islands,</b> South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula. Species from the Antarctic or subantarctic regions are rarer than {{specimens}} in the Arctic regions, although lack of access may be a factor. Until 1983, only five records were made, with only individual finds since then. According to two studies of the myxomycete flora of these regions, more species were discovered in the subantarctic forests, for example 67 species in Argentinian Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and 22 on high ground on Macquarie Island.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June, Kptlt. von Bothmer was {{replaced}} by Kptlt. Gerhard Muhle as commander of the U-boat. U-66 was the first (and ultimately only) U-boat command for the 31-year-old Muhle, {{who had been a}} classmate of von Bothmer when both had joined the Kaiserliche Marine in April 1902. On 9 July, U-66 sank her first ship under her new commander, when she sent the Spanish steamer Iparraguirre to the bottom. The 1,161-ton steamer was headed to Santander from Piteå and Bergen with a cargo of pitwood, when U-66 attacked her west of the <b>Orkney</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
25|$|Knap of Howar, on the <b>Orkney</b> <b>island</b> of Papa Westray, is a well-{{preserved}} Neolithic farmstead.

5|$|Shapinsay {{is one of}} the <b>Orkney</b> <b>Islands</b> off {{the north}} coast of {{mainland}} Scotland. There is one village on the island, Balfour, from which roll-on/roll-off car ferries sail to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland. Balfour Castle, built in the Scottish Baronial style, {{is one of the}} island's most prominent features, a reminder of the Balfour family's domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques. Other landmarks include a standing stone, an Iron Age broch, a souterrain and a salt-water shower.|$|E
5|$|The Irish annals record Áedán's {{campaigns against}} his neighbours, in Ireland, and in {{northern}} Britain, including expeditions to the <b>Orkney</b> <b>Islands,</b> the Isle of Man, {{and the east}} coast of Scotland. As recorded by Bede, Áedán was decisively defeated by Æthelfrith of Bernicia at the Battle of Degsastan. Áedán may have been deposed, or have abdicated, following this defeat. His date of death is recorded by one source as 17 April 609.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment on some of the <b>Orkney</b> <b>islands,</b> but when the market collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
500|$|With {{an area of}} , Shapinsay is the 8th largest <b>Orkney</b> <b>island</b> and the 29th largest Scottish island. The {{highest point}} of Ward Hill is [...] above sea level. The east coast is {{composed}} of low cliffs and has several sea caves, including the picturesque geo at the extreme northern tip known as Geo of Ork. Elwick Bay is a sheltered anchorage on the south coast, facing the <b>Orkney</b> mainland; the <b>island's</b> largest settlement, Balfour, is at {{the western end of}} the bay.|$|R

50|$|The Miracle of Camp 60 is {{a poem by}} poet Anne Stevenson. It is a {{description}} of the Italian Chapel on the <b>Orkney</b> <b>Island</b> of Lamb Holm in 1992, {{from the perspective of a}} fictive Italian ex-POW. 'The miracle of Camp 60' is also used to refer directly to the Chapel in some cases.|$|R
5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} <b>Orkney</b> <b>islands,</b> the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 review {{estimated}} that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, {{with a minimum of}} 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South <b>Orkney</b> <b>Islands.</b> They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{probably}} {{arrived in}} Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority {{emerged in the}} 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Oghaminscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now {{generally considered to be}} of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times. The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the <b>Orkney</b> <b>islands.</b> The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.|$|E
50|$|With {{an area of}} 2948 ha, Shapinsay is the 8th largest <b>Orkney</b> <b>island</b> and the 29th largest Scottish island. The {{highest point}} of Ward Hill is 64 m above sea level. The east coast is {{composed}} of low cliffs and has several sea caves, including the picturesque geo at the extreme northern tip known as Geo of Ork. Elwick Bay is a sheltered anchorage on the south coast, facing the <b>Orkney</b> mainland; the <b>island's</b> largest settlement, Balfour, is at {{the western end of}} the bay.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the demise}} of the company, the P2-001 device was {{acquired}} by Wave Energy Scotland, having completed over 15,000 hours of operation. The device was decommissioned in April 2016 and sold to the <b>Orkney</b> <b>Island</b> Council for £1. The other device, P2-002 was sold to the European Marine Energy Centre for use as a test rig.|$|R
50|$|Hoy Head (III) {{was built}} in the Faroe Islands in 1973 for Shetland Islands Council, {{operating}} as Geira, between Yell and Unst.
