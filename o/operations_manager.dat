5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle <b>operations</b> <b>manager,</b> Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that there is a natural tension between <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> and management accountants. This tension is particularly evident when decisions are being made about process change. Semi-structured interviews with 40 <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> revealed that accountants were only involved in about half of change processes. Surprisingly this proportion was the same for both continuous and radical change programmes despite the latter involving greater risk and capital investment. Six case studies were then used to identify the factors which underpin the degree of involvement where there was close interaction between accountants and <b>operations</b> <b>managers.</b> The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> and some suggestions for further research...|$|R

In July 2010, it was announced that the Mariners' women's team would not compete in the 2010–11 W-League competition.

5|$|After the war, Brain was {{appointed}} Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh {{was still in}} his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing little chance of further advancement where he was, Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of <b>Operations</b> <b>Manager</b> at Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by Arthur Coles. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.|$|E

40|$|Healthcare {{outcome is}} to achieve optimal health for each patient. It is a {{well-known}} phenomenon that patients suffer from care injuries. <b>Operations</b> <b>managers</b> have difficulties in seeing {{that the relationship between}} safety culture, values and attitudes affects the medical care {{to the detriment of the}} patient. The aim was to describe the views on patient safety by <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> and the establishment of patient safety and safety culture in somatic hospital care. Four open questions were answered by 29 <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> in somatic hospital care. Data analysis was carried out by deductive qualitative content analysis. <b>Operations</b> <b>managers</b> found production to be the most important goal, and patient safety was linked to this basic mission. Safety work meant to achieve optimal health outcomes for each patient in a continuous development of operations. This was accomplished by pursuing a high level of competence among employees, having a functioning report system and preventing medical errors. Safety culture was mentioned to a smaller extent. The primary target of patient safety work by the <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> was improving care quality which resulted in fewer complications and shorter care time. A change in emphasis to primary safety work is necessary. To accomplish this increased knowledge of communication, teamwork and clinical decision making are required...|$|R

5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication {{resulting from the}} supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as a}} relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks. In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an <b>operations</b> <b>manager</b> and a maintenance foreman for larceny. In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} anyone teaching operations management {{is the perception}} that the issues challenging <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> in the service sector are very different from those faced by <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> in manufacturing. Offering separate curricula for each area is often impractical. In the case where a single course is offered, the focus may be more on one content area than the other often resulting in dissatisfaction for some students. This paper describes a process that allows a facilitator to simply and quickly test this perception. The participants, drawing from their experience, provide examples of why it is difficult to successfully manage day-to-day operations and then uses the Affinity Diagram of the Quality Management Tools and some of the logic (Thinking Process) tools of the Theory of Constraints to determine if the challenges facing <b>operations</b> <b>managers</b> in the service and manufacturing arenas are more similar or different.
