5|$|The major isotope of berkelium, 249Bk, is {{synthesized}} in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, {{and at the}} Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia.

However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E

She also made contributions to astrochemistry, when NASA asked her to analyze the chemistry of Moon rocks which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> 254Es isotope.|$|E

5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} {{is very difficult}} to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E
5|$|Frequently drawing {{comparisons}} to Ted Washington and Shaun Rogers, Cody was considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> two-gap defensive tackles that NFL teams covet for their 3–4 type defenses. Many NFL experts therefore projected Cody {{to be selected}} in the first-round of the 2010 NFL Draft. One of the teams interested in Cody was rumored to be his near-hometown Miami Dolphins, who lost their veteran defensive tackle Jason Ferguson to injury during the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by 80s arcade {{games and}} more recent titles of the time, such as Super Metroid and Super Mario 64, Jet Force Gemini blends {{elements}} of both shoot 'em up and action-adventure games. Works such as Aliens, Stargate and Battle of the Planets were also major influences. The game received generally positive reviews from critics. Praise was given to its detailed graphics and satisfying gameplay, while criticism was levelled at the game's difficult controls and insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the game. In 2015, Jet Force Gemini was included as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rare</b> Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was easier to get along with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E
5|$|The {{action in}} the book moves from Newby's life in the fashion {{business}} in London to Afghanistan. On the way Newby describes his very brief training in mountaineering in North Wales, a stop in Istanbul, and a nearly-disastrous drive across Turkey and Persia. They are driven out to the Panjshir Valley, where they begin their walk, with many small hardships described in a humorous narrative, supported by genuine history of Nuristan and brief descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> moments of beauty along the way. Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.|$|E

5|$|TiCl4 is a dense, {{colourless}} distillable liquid, although crude samples may be {{yellow or}} even red-brown. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> transition metal halides {{that is a}} liquid at room temperature, VCl4 being another example. This property {{reflects the fact that}} TiCl4 is molecular; that is, each TiCl4 molecule is relatively weakly associated with its neighbours. Most metal chlorides are polymers, wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. The attraction between the individual TiCl4 molecules is weak, primarily van der Waals forces, and these weak interactions result in low melting and boiling points, similar to those of CCl4.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game journalists, who praised its visual appeal and smart, funny humour. The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release {{towards the end}} of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned a cult following due to its unique styling. A remake, , was released for the Xbox in 2005. In 2015, the game was included as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rare</b> Replay compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Live & Reloaded, Rare began work on another game in the Conker {{universe}} titled Conker: Gettin' Medieval. The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character, with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series. However, the game was ultimately cancelled. Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the sandbox game Project Spark. The campaign, titled Conker's Big Reunion, is set {{ten years after the}} events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice roles. The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015, but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September. Conker's Bad Fur Day is also included as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rare</b> Replay compilation for Xbox One. The compilation was released on August 4, 2015.|$|E
