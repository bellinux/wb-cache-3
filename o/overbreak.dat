The south-bound tunnel was completed in July 2010.All four faces of the two tubes of the tunnel have been worked on simultaneously. Rrëshen - Kalimash segment's third section of road between Thirrë and Kolshi included Mt. Runes at an elevation of 1,858m. Laying road on Mt. Runes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the engineers. Another challenge was the transportation of construction equipment and material. As about 3,800 people worked on the project, there was the additional responsibility of feeding, clothing and housing them.A partial collapse occurred at a 50m section in the central-south bore of the tunnel in November 2009. No injuries or equipment damages were reported. The collapse occurred because of heavy <b>overbreak</b> (during excavation) at a geologically complex area inside the tunnel and delayed the completion of the south-bound tunnel. During the tunnel construction, the tunneling team encountered five types of rock. In fact, only the north-bound tunnel was opened as per schedule in June 2009.|$|E

In this paper, a {{prediction}} method of the <b>overbreak</b> blocks in tunnels is developed in the frame of the wavelet neural network of geological statistics models. Geometrical parameters of structural plane are first obtained by field survey.

Furthermore, the volumes and distribution of the <b>overbreak</b> blocks are calculated by the theory of wavelet neural network. Finally, the valid support measurements can be designed according to the prediction results for all <b>overbreak</b> blocks appeared in tunnel excavation, and the amount of <b>overbreak</b> blocks can also be predicted. The code with respect to the method has been developed by the fortran language. The method proposed in this paper has been used in a tunnel construction. The results show that there exists an approximate 10 %~ 30 % difference between the prediction and the real volume of <b>overbreak</b> blocks. Therefore, the method can be well used to predict the volumes distribution and the <b>overbreak</b> blocks, and the accordingly support measurements can be also given according to the prediction results...|$|E

40|$|Rock zones {{containing}} a high fracture density and=or soft, low cohesion materials {{can be highly}} problematic when encountered during tunnel excavation. For example in the eastern Aar massif of central Switzerland, experiences during {{the construction of the}} Gotthard highway tunnel showed that heavily fractured areas within shear zones were responsible for <b>overbreaks</b> in the form of chimneys several metres in height. To understand and estimate the impact of the shear zones on rock mass behaviour, knowledge concerning the rock mass strength and deformation character-istics is fundamental. A series of laboratory triaxial tests, performed on samples from granite- and gneiss-hosted shear zones revealed that with increasing degree of tectonic overprint, sample strength decreases and rock behaviour shows a transition from brittle to ductile deformation. These trends may be explained by increasing fracture densities, increasing foliation intensity, increasing thickness of fine-grained, low cohesion fracture infill, and increasing mica content associated with the increasing degree of tectonic overprint. As fracture density increases and the influence of discrete, persistent discontinuities on rock mass strength decreases, behaviour of the test samples becomes more and more representative of rock mass behaviour, i. e. that of a densely fractured continuum. For the purpose of numerical modeling calculations, the shear zones may b...|$|R

This is not only important to ensure sound performance of the borehole heat pump (BHP) during its life-cycle but also mandatory, as laid down in the Swiss Federal Waters Protection Ordinance. The ski resort of Verbier in the Swiss Alps {{is used as a}} case example. The study systematically compares the dimensioning of BHP based on a priori parameter values (deduced from knowledge of the local geology and the SIA 384 / 6 Swiss codes) with results from a posteriori values obtained from thermal response tests (TRT).

40|$|The {{drill and}} blast (D&B) method is {{applied in the}} {{excavation}} {{of a wide range}} of underground spaces, such as tunnels, rock caverns and mines. It has been progressing rapidly to reduce construction time and cost with the introduction of more effective and accurate hydraulic and computerized drilling jumbos, higher capacity of loading and transport equipment, and more advanced explosives and detonating systems. Especially, the development of technology in the drilling jumbo and measuring equipment made it possible for tunneling engineers to perform more sophisticated and comfortable operations by the feedback from recorded data. The result from blasting in a drill and blast tunnel is generally evaluated through pull percentage (the ratio of actual pull length to drilled length per round), the level of induced vibration and noise, and quality of the excavated contour. Among these, the quality of the contour, which means the condition of the tunnel perimeter, may be characterized by overbreak/underbreak and contour roughness. Many researchers have been performing various experiments and studies to optimize contour quality since it is directly related to construction time and cost as well as management costs in unlined water tunnels. In addition to studies on the mechanisms which determine contour quality, another important subject with regards to contour quality is to establish ways to be able to quantify and characterize it for more detailed analyses. However, there has not been any concept developed for this purpose, although some indices to evaluate the result of a tunnel blasting or ways to reduce <b>overbreak</b> have been proposed. Hence, this thesis presents an index, TCI (Tunnel Contour Quality Index) to evaluate the contour quality of traffic tunnels or underground spaces. TCI is defined as a fraction form consisting of one constant for range adjustment, three elements and three weights for the elements. Each element consists of one correction factor and one parameter: either total <b>overbreak,</b> the ratio of contour length (RCL) or longitudinal <b>overbreak</b> variation for considering increased cross sectional area, increased contour length and the variation of the increased area in the longitudinal direction respectively. RCL can be estimated by total <b>overbreak</b> and deviation difference (average difference of deviation between two neighboring measured points in a tunnel section). TCI is classified into TCIT for the evaluation of an entire tunnel or more than five blasting rounds, and TCIR for the evaluation of only one or each blasting round. In addition, the index for head loss used for a water tunnel, where the increase in cross sectional area results in the decrease of head loss, is also suggested. The effects of drilling and rock mass on contour quality were analyzed, with the help of drilling information produced automatically from computerized drilling jumbos and software, on the basis of field investigations. The result shows that when total <b>overbreak</b> is classified, according to the causes, into the <b>overbreak</b> by starting position of the contour hole, the <b>overbreak</b> by look-out and the <b>overbreak</b> by other factors, the three causes account for approximately 40 % : 50 % : 10 % of total <b>overbreak</b> respectively, for the Q-value range between 1 and 100. <b>Overbreak</b> by other factors, deviation difference and longitudinal <b>overbreak</b> variation generally decrease with higher Q-value or RBS (Relative Block Size, RQD / Jn, Jn : rating for the number of joint sets), although the correlation between them is quite low. And the smallest <b>overbreak</b> by other factors and deviation difference were found when the joint orientation was between 30 ° and 0 °, and between 60 ° and 90 ° respectively, to the left of the tunnel excavation direction. Estimation models for total <b>overbreak</b> and deviation difference are suggested on the basis of rock mass quality (Q-value or RBS) and drilling conditions that are given from drilling logs. In the end, TCI can be estimated with the models prior to blasting. The estimation models for shotcrete and muckpile volume are suggested using the models as well. To check the effect of TCI on construction time, the existing simulation tool based on the NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) construction time estimation models has been upgraded so that it is able to estimate the construction time including rock support, in an Excel spreadsheet. Construction time and advance rate were analyzed with the variation of Q-value for seven sizes of a road tunnel, using the software. It is found that the decrease of TCIR by 10 units results in an increase of 5. 2 % in cycle time. The study may be divided into three parts in general, for which different approaches have been applied; The first part describes the definition of TCI, and has been performed on the basis of a literature study, schematic analysis, site investigations and assumptions. The second part focuses on the analysis of major factors affecting TCI, as well as the estimation models for TCI, shotcrete volume and muckpile volume. The analysis was made based on site investigations and a statistical approach. The third part describes the effects of TCI on construction time, based upon the definition of TCI as well as upgraded construction time estimation models. Lastly, to make TCI into a more effective index for the evaluation of contour quality, analyses on TCI distribution according to various types of tunnels are necessary. Based on the distribution, a guideline or specification as well as the weights of TCI having scientific grounds need to be provided for the better management of tunnel contour quality.

The research undertaken in this document, applicable {{to a wide range of}} underground mines employing the blasthole mining method to extract tabular orebodies, focuses on examining factors attributable to the generation of unstable stope hanging-walls. The primary objective of the research undertaken is to establish new models for stope and orezone design, with respect to anticipated stope <b>overbreak,</b> focusing on the position and type of stope within the orezone extraction sequence. Identified factors influencing unplanned dilution, such as: induced stress environment, stope geometry, and the setting of individual stopes are considered. The research undertaken incorporates a variety of components, including (i) parametric 3 -D numerical modelling to examine influences of individual factors on hanging-wall <b>overbreak,</b> (ii) case example analysis, and (iii) orezone extraction sequence simulation, using 3 -D elastic numerical modelling. Design criteria, developed from the parametric modelling, was applied to the orezone sequence modelling to develop trends for stope dilution, as functions of stope design and construction. It was found that hanging-wall <b>overbreak</b> is not significantly influenced by depth alone, and that stopes with large vertical and short horizontal dimensions or stopes having long horizontal and short vertical dimensions are more stable than large square-like stopes. Also, through parametric and case studies, it was demonstrated that, in addition to stope dimension, the amount of unplanned dilution differed according to stope type. Five stope types were identified, based on their position within a tabular blasthole mining sequence. Measured <b>overbreak</b> varies with stope type, with secondary stopes generating a greater volume of hanging-wall dilution than do primary stopes.

Faster drivages, attempted these days for reducing the long gestation periods of projects, have often resulted in large <b>overbreak.</b> This is due to the unacceptable levels of ground vibration to which the rock is subjected. Factors contributing to this include longer pulls; burn cuts, higher explosive per hole and per delay etc. Blast-induced rock damage (BIRD) assessment based on far-field peak particle velocity (PPV) measurement, when extrapolated near the face, has often resulted in suggesting higher PPV threshold levels. Apart from this the geological and structural features play a dominant role in masking the intensity of blast waves. Therefore, near-filed monitoring using accelerometers has been attempted in one of the metal mines to study the blast damage in faces excavated by burn cut.

40|$|Unplanned {{dilution}} has {{the potential}} to seriously undermine the economic viability of a mine, and in some cases results in mine closure. The effect of stress damage on dilution has become increasingly relevant as mining depths increase. In the case of narrow vein mining, the incremental extraction of long-hole rings {{has the potential}} to result in a moving high stressed zone at the stope brow. This leads the hanging wall and footwall to experience a spike in the stress to strength ratios as the brow passes. In some cases, the stress to strength ratio may be high enough to result in fracturing or damage to the rock mass. The aim of the study described in this paper was to investigate whether stress damage results in a significant increase in dilution. The study involved analysis of <b>overbreak</b> from 410 case studies from the Kundana Gold mine in Western Australia. Site personnel had already undertaken calibration studies of the stress levels that result in rock mass damage. This calibration, in conjunction with numerical modelling showed that stress damaged stope walls at this mine had on average 50 per cent more <b>overbreak</b> than stope walls where stresses had not exceeded the damage criterion. For a design mining width of 1. 5 metres, and with both walls impacted, this represents 36 per cent increase in dilution. After adjustment for possible sources of bias the difference reduced to an average 0. 10 metres per stope wall, representing 13 per cent dilution for the mining width under consideration. The potential for stress damage related <b>overbreak</b> should therefore be considered as part of any assessment of narrow vein dilution...|$|E

Rock joint parameters such as persistence, spacing and shear strength are the factors which significantly modify the working environments {{in the vicinity of}} the openings. Therefore, a detailed tunnel stability assessment is critically important based on the field data collection on the excavated tunnel's face. In this context, intact as well as rock mass strength and deformation modulus is obtained from laboratory tests for each rock type encountered in the study area. Finite element method (FEM) is used for stability analysis purpose by parametrically varying rock joint persistence, spacing and shear strength parameters, until the condition of <b>overbreak</b> is reached. Another case of marginally stable condition is also obtained based on the same parameters. The results show that stability of tunnels is highly influenced by these parameters and the size of <b>overbreak</b> is controlled by joint persistence and spacing.

For these Kundana stopes, a poor correlation was found between stope stability and both the Mathews stability number N and hydraulic radius HR. Given that both N and HR correlate well with stability {{in the vast majority}} of Mathews method case histories, this suggested that there is an overriding influence on stability at Barkers not accounted for in the Mathews method. Drill and blast issues were isolated as the most likely cause of this poor correlation. Blast pattern was found to have a statistically significant effect on <b>overbreak.</b> In terms of the drill and blast patterns used at the mine, the inline pattern performed significantly better than both the 2 ̆ 7 staggered 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 dice- 52 ̆ 7 patterns for the vein geometries at the time. Undercut footwalls were found to behave in a similar manner to non-undercut hangingwalls. There was no evidence that backfill abutments behave differently from solid rock abutments in terms of determination of stable stope dimensions.

40|$|When {{a tunnel}} is {{constructed}} by drilling and blasting operation, the excavated perimeter becomes uneven due to <b>overbreak</b> at the drill holes {{so that the}} thickness of shotcrete tends to be irregular. In this case, the conventional stress analyses for tunnel lining of a uniform thickness cannot be readily applicable. In this study, the profile of tunnel perimeter assumed to be sinusoidal in order to simulate the uneven tunnel perimeter and to control the thickness of shotcrete by using the amplitude and wavelength. By adopting the sinusoidal function to a theoretical solution of stress analysis for uniform lining, the range of axial stress of irregular shotcrete can be estimated. The applicability of the approximate solution has been verified by performing a series of numerical analyses for various conditions. It is shown that the axial stress of shorcrete is highly dependent upon the irregularity of shotcrete, together with the ground property and initial stress conditions. It is also shown the shear stress is dependent upon the wavelength, and the stress condition becomes unfavorable where the thickness of shotcrete is relatively small.

These instabilities, which are unevenly distributed throughout the rock mass, have failure modes primarily including spalling, strainbursting, structurally controlled failure, and combinations thereof.

An efficient data acquisition, processing, and management workflow was presented in this study. Based on the quality control indices, including the average gradient, slope toe elevation, and <b>overbreak</b> and underbreak, cross-sectional quality assessment and holistic quality assessment methods were proposed to assess the slope excavation quality with laser-scanned data.

The results show that the quality assessment indices can be obtained rapidly and accurately with design parameters and scanned data, and the results of holistic quality assessment are consistent with those of cross-sectional quality assessment. In addition, the time consumption in excavation quality assessment with the laser scanning technology can be reduced by 70 %– 90 %, as compared with the traditional method.

This paper summarises how the framework of the Extended Mathews stability graph framework has been applied to quantify the effect of stress relaxation upon excavation stability, examine site-specifi c effects and highlight the poor correlation between stability graph parameters for narrow stope stability. Back-analysis of case studies where stope surfaces were relaxed has enabled the effect of stress relaxation upon excavation stability to be quantified and bounded. Detailed statistical analyses have demonstrated that a reliable stable-failure boundary requires at least 150 case histories, of which a minimum of 10 % should be unstable stope surfaces. Marginal site-specifi c effects were observed for the operating conditions captured within the database. Apparent site-specifi c effects noted in previous literature were found to be attributable to operating conditions inadequately represented in the database. Statistical analysis of <b>overbreak</b> from 115 narrow-vein case studies has demonstrated that operating conditions in narrow-vein mines differ suffi ciently to warrant changes in the model framework to account for undercutting of stope walls and drill and blast parameters. Backfi ll abutments were found to behave the same as solid rock abutments...|$|E
40|$|<b>Overbreak</b> {{and damage}} to rock walls {{is one of}} the most serious {{problems}} encountered in blasting operations. Several techniques have been developed to control the undesirable effects of rock blasting. These techniques are collectively known as wall-control blasting methods. The stress distribution around pressurized holes has been numerically evaluated, in order to analyze the mechanism of wall-control blasting methods. The effect of blast geometry and the role of discontinuity on this stress field has also been studied in detail. The results obtained by numerical modelling have been verified by controlled blasting experiments, and further supported by analysis of existing roadcuts on a large scale. It was found that the mechanism of wall-control blast can be explained by the collision and superposition of the stresses between the holes. A narrow fracture zone between the holes was produced by tensile stresses on the centreline. It is neither necessary nor realistic to assume onset of fractures at the midpoint between holes by reinforcement of the stresses from each hole. The analysis shows that a burden can be defined as being infinite when the ratio of that to the spacing is greater than unity. For pre-split blasting (infinite burden) in an isotropic and homogeneous material the hole separation could range up to 15 borehole diameters. The decoupling ratio between the explosive charge and the borehole diameter should be smaller than 0. 5. This ratio would generally be between 0. 2 and 0. 3 for pre-splitting (infinite burden), and between 0. 3 and 0. 4 in the presence of a free face. A discontinuity parallel to the free face and located at the back of the holes causes high stress levels between the discontinuity and the boreholes, resulting is a shattered one in this region. The presence of a similar discontinuity at the front of the holes leads to considerable <b>overbreak</b> and development of an undamaged "hump" of rock between holes. The effect of a discontinuity oriented normal to the centreline at the midpoint between holes has minimal effect on the blast results. As the angle of the discontinuity with the free face decreases from 90 $ sp circ,$ the damage zone between the holes and the discontinuity increases, and the shape of the final wall changes from a smooth face to a corrugated shape. A closed-discontinuity or an open discontinuity cemented with strong filling materials has little effect on the results of the blast. However, as the width of the discontinuity increases, the size of the damage zone also increases. An open discontinuity, 50 mm wide or more, plays a role similar to a free face. In roadcut blast design, hole deviation is a key parameter in determining the quality of the face. However, consistent hole deviation in the same direction has minimal effect in the result of the blast. This type of deviation is usually associated with bedded rocks, with alternating bands of soft and hard rock on the face. The degree of deviation is dependent, amongst other factors, on orientation, thickness, frequency and the position of these bands...|$|E
40|$|With {{decreasing}} profit margins, optimising {{the size}} of stopes to minimise dilution is a step towards achieving a productive and profitable mining operation. The stability graph was developed to provide guidance in the determination of stope sizes to control dilution in bulk mining. Unfortunately, this graph is qualitative and stopes {{can only be described}} as stable, unstable or cave. The alternative to the qualitative stability graph is the equivalent linear <b>overbreak</b> slough (ELOS) stability graph. The original stability graph is only applicable to wide orebodies while the ELOS stability graph only applies to narrow-vein orebodies and does not provide explicit quantitative dilution values. The objective of this research is to develop a generalised quantitative dilution-based stability graph independent of orebody width. To achieve this objective a total of 226 stope case studies on open stope performances were gathered from six current underground metalliferous mining operations located across Australia. The data was statistically analysed using Logistic regression and the Bayesian likelihood discrimination method to produce quantitative dilution-based stability graphs independent of orebody widths. The graphs provide the mining engineer the flexibility to design open stope sizes based on what dilution amounts are acceptable to a given operation. While the graphs were developed from a statistically significant database, additional data could improve the confidence and reliability in their use. It should also be noted that while the database is from Australian mines, the graphs could be used elsewhere with similar geological and mining conditions to those used in the study...|$|E
40|$|The {{implications}} of blast damage are harmful in {{both economic and}} physical sense. To understand the mysterious nature of blast damage assessment and prediction, field work was done by driving an experimental tunnel in the bench of a quartzite quarry. On {{the basis of the}} blast vibration monitoring records, a model was developed to predict the PPV at different distances from a blasthole. Critical particle velocity for damage and the output of the prediction model were used to delineate the extent of damage for different explosives. The predictory model was tested by designing a special blast and the burdens for the back holes have been recommended. The relationship between the critical particle velocity for "Fall Off ' and the critical particle, velocity for damage has been established. The existing criteria for blast damage have also been reviewed in this paper. INTRODUCfiON Blasting is an inherently destructive and irreversible process. It is used in hard rock mines due to its economics and adaptability. Main concern during excavation by blasting is its damage to the periphery of an excavation which results in the visible alteration to the appearance of the rock structure in the form of cracking, slabbing, and <b>overbreak.</b> It has been observed that the significant reduction in the strength of the rock mass can take place well before the appearance of these obvious signs of damage. If the extent of the damage and its effects on the surrounding rock can be predicted, blasts can be modified to reduce dilution and instability problems. Therefore a study was designed with the following objectives; i) Development of a predictory model to estimate the peak particle velocity (PPV) in the vicinity of a blasthole. ii) To determine the critical particle velocity (Vd) for damage. iii) To test the predictory model by an actual blast. iv) To determine the critical particle velocity (Vr) fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} origin of fractures in rock. The man-made fracturing from engineering activities in crystalline rock as well as the fracturing induced by the natural process of meteorite impacts is studied by means of various characterization methods. In contrast to engineering induced rock fracturing, where the goal usually is to minimize rock damage, meteorite impacts cause abundant fracturing in the surrounding bedrock. In a rock mass the interactions of fractures on the microscopic scale (mm-cm scale) influence fractures on the mesoscopic scale (dm-m scale) as well as the interaction of the mesocopic fractures influencing fractures on the macroscopic scale (m-km scale). Thus, among several methods used on different scales, two characterization tools have been developed further. This investigation ranges from the investigation of micro-fracturing in ultra-brittle rock on laboratory scale to the remote sensing of fractures in large scale structures, such as meteorite impacts. On the microscopic scale, the role of fractures pre-existing to the laboratory testing is observed to affect the development of new fractures. On the mesoscopic scale, the evaluation of the geometric information from 3 D-laser scanning has been further developed for the characterisation of fractures from tunnelling and to evaluate the efficiency of the tunnel blasting technique in crystalline rock. By combining information on: i) the <b>overbreak</b> and underbreak; ii) the orientation and visibility of blasting drillholes and; iii) the natural and blasting fractures in three dimensions; a analysis of the rock mass can be made. This analysis of the rock mass is much deeper than usually obtained in rock engineering for site characterization in relation to the blasting technique can be obtained based on the new data acquisition. Finally, the estimation of fracturing in and around two meteorite impact structures has been used to reach a deeper understanding of the relation between fracture, their water content and the electric properties of the rock mass. A correlation between electric resistivity and fracture frequency in highly fractured crystalline rock has been developed and applied to potential impact crater structures. The results presented in this thesis enables more accurate modelling of rock fractures, both supporting rock engineering design and interpretation of meteorite impact phenomena. QC 2010070...|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} work {{constituted the}} third phase of a programme of research into the performance of concrete pipes during installation by the pipe-jacked tunnelling technique. This third stage was {{a continuation of the}} on-site monitoring of full-scale pipe jacks during construction. Four schemes were monitored in different ground conditions: London clay, dense fine sand below the water table, stiff glacial till and soft alluvial clay. Pipe sizes ranged from 1000 mm to 1800 mm internal diameter and excavation methods included hand tools, slurry machines and an open face tunnel boring machine. The main objective was to collect information on jacking loads and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete jacking pipe that could be inserted anywhere in the pipe string. Jacking loads and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of jacking load build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between jacking loads, pipeline misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex. Ground movement measurements compared to well established empirical predictive methods show that short-term displacements are related to ground losses caused by closure of the <b>overbreak</b> void between shield and pipe...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{understand}} rock mass behaviour has never been greater; as mining globally progresses deeper to extract the precious resources humankind needs to maintain and forward our lives, we encounter rock behaviours associated with deep mining. These environments typically experience seismicity (including fault slip), rock bursting, strain bursting, spalling, aseismic movement along pre-existing discontinuities, and ground falls. These behaviours can have significant consequences to an operation’s safety and profitability. An understanding of the rock mass enables risk mitigating design. However, a number of hindrances exist along the path to gaining this understanding. Limited information in the literature is available on which data to collect, the most appropriate analysis techniques, and how one combines varied data sources into a mine-scale understanding of the rock mass. In essence, {{we do not yet}} understand how to listen to the story of the rock mass. This thesis explores these research topics and develops and extends techniques and methodologies to address these issues. Data from Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB’s (LKAB) Kiirunavaara Mine was used, however a strong focus was given to developing general methodologies that can be applied to many mining environments. The typical situation at most mine sites is one where many forms of data exist, a subset of which is conventional rock mechanics data. These data typically include, for example, laboratory testing for strength and stiffness of geological units, rock mass characterization from underground mapping, geological and geomechanical core logging, and positions and orientations of mapped discontinuities from underground mapping and/or oriented core logging. These data are often used for empirical design. It is common with particularly damaging seismic and/or ground fall events that additional data be acquired from underground damage mapping, but this information is rarely used on a larger scale. However, there is a subset of data that tends to be overlooked from a geomechanical perspective, even though the potential exists that this data can give us information about the characteristics of the rock mass. In the case of the Kiirunavaara Mine, this includes seismic data (including tomographic velocity structure), a database of information regarding ground falls, and laser imaging data. A variety of conventional and unconventional data from the Kiirunavaara Mine were analysed using existing, and extensions of existing, analysis techniques. A 3 -D geomechanical model was developed, incorporating geological and geomechanical core logging data, underground mapping data, and laboratory testing data. The resulting mine-scale model showed some particularly interesting results, including 1) a very large variation in intact rock strength within each statistical grouping of geological units, combined with much overlap between the strengths of geological units, and 2) a 3 -D model of volumes of clay alteration built on geological core logging data calibrated favourably to data of underground mapping of clay. Unconventional data sources were also analysed, in particular the use of behavioural data to infer characteristics of the rock mass. Spatial and temporal patterns of ground falls were evaluated, alongside spatial patterns in <b>overbreak,</b> which were identified using new, mine-scale analysis techniques of laser scanning data. Interestingly, correlations were apparent when comparing the analyses of distinct and separate data sources. Ground falls were concentrated in the intact rock between the clay volumes. The rock quality designation (RQD) had lower values in the same volume. Seismicity in the area was concentrated in the intact rock, with very few events in the clay volumes. 3 -D velocity tomography models (developed by another researcher within this project) showed 1) no correlation with the RQD model (this result may highlight a limitation of scaling RQD data beyond it’s intended use), and 2) possible correlation with the clay volumes. A methodology was developed using numerical stress analysis to identify, at an early stage of investigation, if a volumetric feature is of significance to seismic rock mass behaviour. With so much surmounting evidence that the clay volumes influence rock mass behaviour at the Kiirunavaara Mine, this feature was well-suited to be tested. Results showed that the clay volumes: 1) influence the mine-scale stress field, 2) have the potential to extend the volume of the rock mass which is expected to experience crack initiation (one underlying cause of seismicity), and 3) result in a stress field that enables slip along many of the orientations of mapped discontinuities (another underlying cause of seismicity). Particularly valuable data were found to share the following characteristics: 3 -D coverage, mine-scale, long-term, and multiple and distinct sources. It was important that the different data sources and their analyses led to the same conclusions even though they were separate and distinct. Unconventional data sources that were of particular use in this case include: spatial and temporal ground fall patterns and spatial patterns of seismicity. With further research, other unconventional data sources may show their value to rock mechanics analyses, such as spatial and temporal patterns of: seismicity, focal plane solutions from moment tensors, seismic stress inversion from moment tensors, <b>overbreak,</b> and possibly even tomography (the lack of strong correlation in this case may be specific to this environment and models used). Opening our minds to the possibilities, collaboration with experts in other fields, and a little creativity in our approach will help us in our quest {{to understand}} the stories of rock masses...|$|E
40|$|The {{drill and}} blast {{excavation}} method {{is the most}} commonly used method for tunnel construction in Norway. In D&B the results from blasting can be evaluated through several factors, such as pull percentage, vibration level and contour quality. The main goal of the thesis was to analyze excavation with a special focus {{on the quality of the}} achieved contour and the influence of the applied initiation system. The analysis was performed based on results from the Bjørnegård tunnel, which was a part of the E 16 Sandvika-Wøyen, Norwegian infrastructural project. Tunnel excavation analysis was done by an estimation of the drilling accuracy and measurement results from scanning. Data for the thesis was collected from one tunnel tube from twelve rounds in total: seven of which used standard non-electric detonators and five used electronic detonators. The assumption was that the use of the electronic detonators as an initiation system has the potential for better contour quality. Special accuracy of the drilling was required for the test. The analysis was divided into two parts. The first part was focused on the analysis of drilling accuracy. For the evaluation of the results, MWD data from the drilling jumbo was used. Local coordinates from the drilling rig were used for the estimation of the spacing and length of the drilling holes, while global coordinates were used for the start and end position of the holes in comparison to the theoretical contour. The second part focused on the analysis of the results from the tunnel scanning, which provided information about theoretical and actual contour length, theoretical and overblast area and distances from the theoretical to the actually blasted contour. Scanning analysis was based on an evaluation of the ratio of actual contour length to planned contour length (RCL), ratio of actual blasted to planned area(RBA), <b>overbreak</b> and Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI). Analysis of the drilling results showed no significant difference between the accuracy of the drilling in the non-electric rounds compared to the test rounds. Estimation of the spacing and length of the contour holes presented a difference of 1 % and 3 % respectively. Results of the calculation of the starting position of the holes indicated a decrease of the accuracy of the placement of the hole in accordance to the theoretical profile. The special requirement of a maximum 10 cm distance from the theoretical contour of the starting position of the holes was fulfilled for 13 % of the holes drilled in the test rounds. Evaluation of the scanning results showed that results from non-electric and electronic detonators rounds were similar, and no improvement of the tunnel quality was calculated. Tunnel Contour Quality Index (TCI) for both data sets was similar and estimated as average...|$|E
