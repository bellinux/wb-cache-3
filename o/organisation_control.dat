40|$|Supply {{chains are}} omnipresent. However, the modus operandi of the {{construction}} supply chain is not clearly established in the literature. This might be attributable {{to the character of}} construction projects and the structure {{of the construction}} industry. Formal and informal control mechanisms are well established in retail and manufacturing supply chains which is evident in improved product performance. However, there is a paucity of research on the construction supply chain especially at identifying the interplay of control mechanisms and their relationship with project performance. In the case of large and complex construction projects, the client-contractor relationship requires input control, behaviour control and output control for successful project delivery. In the light of <b>organisation</b> <b>control</b> theory and the existing literature on construction supply chains, this study evaluates the modus operandi of the client-contractor relationship based on three control mechanisms: input control (project risk and reward power, and intra-project communication), behaviour control (opportunism) and output control (project performance) using a structural equation model. A survey data of 258 construction professionals working on construction projects in India was collected. The study findings reveal that input control, in terms of project risk and reward power, and intraproject communication, largely influence behaviour control in terms of opportunism. However, behaviour controls do not directly affect output control in terms of project performance; rather, a direct effect of the input control mechanism of output control is particularly evident. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of information technology, or IT, has brought increased possibilities to work {{outside of the}} traditional office. One of these possibilities is telework. Telework refers to work carried out away from the usual place of business, often via electronic means. This investigation provides a unique contribution {{to the lack of}} empirical studies on telework in France. Despite its predicted growth, telework has not developed in the French public sector. This study uses role set analysis to assess the experiences of part-time teleworkers (who telework on average two days per week as part of their full-time schedules) at the Conseil Général du Finistère, or CGF, a regional government in Brittany, France. Role set analysis claims that the expectations of role set holders can be evaluated. In this exploratory case study, role set holders are represented by teleworkers, their non-teleworking colleagues and their line managers. Questionnaires, containing attitude scales and open-ended questions, were distributed in three versions to each group of role set holders to gather data. The use of frequency tables and the extraction of Meaning Units, or MUs, indicated perceived advantages and disadvantages of telework, which were revealed through the lenses of role expectations. Teleworkers experienced more advantages due to role complexity: temporal and spatial flexibility were beneficial to teleworkers, despite increased difficulties for non-teleworking colleagues and line managers. Non-teleworkers experienced more disadvantages due to increased role expectations: working with part-time teleworkers generated increased logistical and co-ordination difficulties. Line managers experienced more disadvantages due to multiplied role expectations: managing teleworkers and non-teleworkers in the same departments meant increased burdens in terms of work <b>organisation,</b> <b>control</b> and resentment from non-teleworkers. From an academic viewpoint, the analysis of role sets through a tripartite perspective brings to light thresholds which regulate perceived advantages and disadvantages of telework and reveals that role set holders do not interact in a static fashion. In terms of business practice, the findings argue that telework upsets work relationships in the French context because it relies on less face-to-face contact. Results also suggest that despite the perceived success of the telework programme, the CGF has not adopted a remote working culture...|$|E

40|$|M. Com. (Industrial Pyschology) The {{critical}} labour {{situation in}} South Africa makes industrial peace absolutely vital. In addition, industrial peace creates a healthy climate, both for productivity in {{companies and the}} economic progress of a country. The South African economy has, since the twenties, been oppressed by industrial unrest. The strikes of 1920 and the Soweto unrest of 1976 are good examples of this. In spite of these critical situations, a very narrow—minded view of industrial relations prevails. The only factors which, to date, have received any real attention are political/ legislative or economic in nature. In addition, these factors cannot be manipulated {{by the majority of}} people in any organisation or in the country — they are factors which are handled by top management or the Government. The levels of management most in contact with workers on the floor, are therefore not represented in the framework for improvement of industrial relations. The objective of this research is to build a more comprehensive framework for the improvement of industrial relations. Intensive study has highlighted the fact that three behavioural skills, namely empathy, flexibility and judgement appear to have a considerable influence on the relations between manager and worker. These behavioural skills are manifested in communication in the management process and in the following key behavioural areas: (a) Listen and react consistently and fairly. (b) Continuous feedback: Follow—up date and action. Constructive criticism. Maintain or build self esteem. (c) Encourage the subordinate to participate in situations with which he is familiar and which affect him. the subordinate in unfamiliar situations. Inform the subordinate about situations which affect him. With the use of a questionnaire, it was established that these key behavioural areas and communication between workers in all racial groups are seen to be significantly more important in relationships between manegement and worker. It was also found that management training in planfling, <b>organisation,</b> <b>control,</b> leadership and communication, based on the behavioural skills and key behavioural areas, had a very positive effect on all the key behavioural areas and communication. Although this effect was seen by the total group to be considerable, in the case of two individual racial groups, i. e. Whites and Asians, it was not considered to be significant. This tendency is, however, explained by the time Epread of the training in the company where this research was carried out. Generally, therefore, it appears that scientific management practices, namely behavioural skills and key behavioural areas, have a considerable influence on industrial relations and that management training has a significant contribution to make to its improvement...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEd (Education Policy Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Policy is {{generally}} established {{to provide for}} specific needs. In South Africa, for example, the South African Schools Act of 1996 was introduced, among other reasons, to promote democratic transformation in society, {{to protect the rights}} of all learners, parents and educators and to facilitate their acceptance of responsibility for the <b>organisation,</b> <b>control</b> and financing of schools in partnership with the state (RSA, 1996 b). The SA Schools Act, in accordance with which school governing bodies are constituted, endeavours to effect greater devolution of power from the state to local communities to offer these communities greater participation in the control and management of their schools. Analysis of national and international literature, however, indicates that democratic government policy does not always deliver the desired results in practice (MacLean, 2003). Policy intention and implementation are frequently far removed from the practical reality within which they should be effecting change. Policy implementation is frequently aimed at promoting democracy and equality but, in reality, results in the maintenance and even the strengthening of existing inequalities between élite and marginalised groups. It is not always in touch with the cultural, political and economic obstacles that women in particular have to overcome to be allowed to participate at the same level as men in decision-making processes and in the exercise of power. This study endeavours to determine the real effect of such decentralisation on women as one of the most marginalised groups. During the study, personal interviews were conducted with two selected women and followed up with a questionnaire, which brought to light another dimension to the concept of empowerment: that of the women each attaching her own meaning to the concept of power, which emanates from their different backgrounds in respect of, for example, culture, education and language. Decentralisation can therefore result in different effects, depending on the meaning attached to the concept in a specific context. Women do not see power simply as the making of decisions on issues such as the formulation of policy; they see the right to power and the meaning that they themselves give to power as empowering. It can therefore be said that decentralisation as a policy involves certain textual intentions (which the policy stipulates as text) but that it also involves a contextual intention, which is influenced by different backgrounds. The very fact that women are accorded a voice in forums such as school governing bodies can in itself be experienced as empowering due to the women's own conceptualisation of it. The differences in the interpretation of and meaning attached to the concept indicate a need for research that delves deeper than simply a focus on the number of women participating in local politics. More research is necessary to investigate the circumstances and policy implications of the participation of women. Such research could investigate aspects such as different contexts and people's different interpretations and conceptualisations, which could ultimately be anticipated in policy frameworks. Due cognisance of women’s expectations in respect of the decentralisation or the redistribution of school governing powers and the position of women in such spheres could well result in a greater contribution to the empowerment of women...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how massively {{multiplayer}} online games (MMOGs), as {{an exemplary}} new media form, disrupt practices {{associated with more}} conventional media. These intensely social games exploit the interactivity and networks afforded by new media technologies in ways that generate new challenges for the <b>organisation,</b> <b>control</b> and regulation of media. The involvement of players in constituting these games - through their production of game-play, derivative works and strong social networks that drive the profitability of the games - disrupts {{some of the key}} foundations that underlie other publication media. MMOGs represent a new and hybrid form of media - part publication and part service. As such they sit within a number of sometimes contradictory organising and regulatory regimes. This thesis examines the negotiations and struggles for control between players, developers and publishers as issues of ownership, governance and access arise out of the new configurations. Using an ethnographic approach to gather information and insights into the practices of players, developers and publishers, this project identifies the characteristics of the distributed production network in this experiential medium. It explores structural components of successful interactive applications and analyses how the advent of player agency and the shift in authorship has meant a shift in control of the text and the relations that surround it. The integration of social networks into the textual environment, and into the business model of the media publishers has meant commerce has become entwined with affect in a new way in this medium. Publishers have moved into the role of both property managers, of the intellectual property associated with the game content, and community managers. Intellectual property management is usually associated with the reproduction and distribution of finished media products, and this sits uneasily with the performative and mutable form of this medium. Service provision consists of maintaining the game world environment, community management, providing access for players to other players and to the content generated both by the developers and the other players. Content in an MMOG is identified in this project as both the 'tangible' assets of code and artwork, rules and text, and the 'intangible' or immaterial assets of affective networks. Players are no longer just consumers of media, or even just active interpreters of media. They are co-producing the media as it is developed. This thesis frames that productiveness as unpaid labour, in an attempt to denaturalise the dominant discourse which casts players as consumers. The regulation of this medium is contentious. Conventional forms of media regulation - such as copyright, or content regulation regimes are inadequate for regulating the hybrid service/publication medium. This thesis explores how the use of contracts as the mechanism which constitutes the formal relations between players, publishers and developers creates challenges to some of the regimes of juridical and political rights held by citizens more generally. This thesis examines the productive practices of players and how the discourses of intellectual property and the discourses of the consumer are mobilised to erase the significance of those productive contributions. It also shows, using a Foucauldian analysis of the power negotiations, that players employ many counter-strategies to circumvent the more formal legal structures of the publishers. The dialogic relationship between players, developers and publishers is shown to mobilise various discursive constructions of the role of each. The outcome of these ongoing negotiations may well shape future interactive applications {{and the extent to which}} their innovative capacities will be available for all stakeholders to develop...|$|E
