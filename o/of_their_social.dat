5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Termites, {{although}} {{sometimes called}} 'white ants', are not ants. They {{belong to the}} sub-order Isoptera within the order Blattodea. Termites are {{more closely related to}} cockroaches and mantids. Termites are eusocial, but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution. Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E

5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall heterozygosity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|The Afrasiab {{paintings}} of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and {{events such as the}} arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, Tajikistan. In addition to revealing aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> and political lives, Sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians' understanding of their religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Persian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non-Buddhist image similarly found in the {{paintings of}} Samarkand and Panjakent.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E
