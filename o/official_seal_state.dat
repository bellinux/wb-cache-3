5|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an <b>official</b> <b>seal,</b> the <b>state</b> did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|R

When Alabama became a state in 1819, the state legislature adopted the design as the <b>official</b> <b>state</b> <b>seal.</b> The seal prominently features a map showing one of the state's most valuable resources - its major rivers. The map was shown affixed to a living tree, with no motto.|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} evidence is contradictory and unclear for when {{and by whom}} the Music Bureau was founded; however it {{is known to have}} existed during the Qin Dynasty (221-205 BCE), if not earlier. Apparently, during the political and social turmoil during and after the fall of Qin (during the Chu-Han Contention), the Music Bureau seems to have been discontinued, but it was later revived. The earliest known evidence for the existence of a specific governmental bureau of music appears to be an <b>official</b> <b>seal</b> of <b>State</b> Music Bureau of the state of Qi dating from the Warring States period (480-221 BCE). Certainly, the history of the Classic of Poetry seems to confirm the existence of some sort of official functionaries responsible for the collection of songs and poetry in the royal courts of the Zhou Dynasty and of Lu and other states of the Spring and Autumn period.|$|R
5000|$|The motto {{was first}} used in 1882, when acting Territorial Secretary William G. Ritch added the Latin phrase [...] "Crescit eundo" [...] to an early 1860s version of the {{territorial}} seal. In 1887, Ritch's version of the seal, including the words [...] "Crescit eundo," [...] {{was adopted by the}} legislature as part of the official New Mexico Territory seal and coat of arms. When New Mexico became a state in 1912, the Legislature appointed a commission to settle on a design for an <b>official</b> <b>state</b> <b>seal.</b> As it turned out, the commission recommended the territorial seal to be continued as the <b>state</b> <b>seal,</b> including the words [...] "Crescit eundo" [...] which were then adopted as the official state motto.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Civil War, the [...] "pelican in her piety" [...] {{surrounded}} by the motto [...] "Justice, Union and Confidence" [...] was commonly used as the <b>state's</b> <b>seal,</b> after the Civil War, Union supplanted Justice as the ideal to uphold and the motto was changed to [...] "Union, Justice and Confidence" [...] The Great <b>Seal</b> of the <b>State</b> of Louisiana was adopted as the <b>official</b> <b>state</b> <b>seal</b> of Louisiana in 1902. The seal consists of a heraldic charge called a [...] "pelican in her piety," [...] representing a brown pelican (the official state bird) wounding her breast to feed her young from her own blood. This symbol, emblematic of Christian charity, is also found on the Louisiana state flag. The Louisiana state motto of [...] "Union, justice, confidence" [...] surrounds the birds on the <b>state</b> <b>seal.</b> An outer ring further identifies it with the words [...] "State of Louisiana".|$|R

50|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Revolutionary War, the inscription on the colonial seal was no longer appropriate. Therefore, in May 1784 the General Assembly directed the Secretary to alter the inscription to read SIGILL. REIP. CONNECTICUTENSIS. However, when {{a new version of the}} seal was prepared, the inscription contained the words spelled out: SIGILLUM REIPUBLICÆ CONNECTICUTENSIS ("Seal of the Republic of Connecticut"). There has been no subsequent alteration to the <b>official</b> <b>state</b> <b>seal.</b> In 1931 the General Assembly required that all representations of the <b>state</b> <b>seal</b> conform to the description in chapter 54 of the Public Acts of that year. This legislation also prohibited reproduction of the seal except by or under the direction of the Secretary of the State. It is the only non-circular <b>state</b> <b>seal</b> out of the fifty states, and is joined only by the Seal of Guam when insular areas are included.|$|R

50|$|The Louisiana Revised Statutes specify {{that the}} {{governor}} shall determine {{the design of the}} <b>official</b> <b>state</b> <b>seal.</b> To standardize a design for the seal, Governor Heard instructed the Secretary of State in 1902 to use a seal described as:"A Pelican, with its head turned to the left, in nest with three young; the Pelican, following the tradition in act of tearing its breast to feed its young; {{around the edge of the}} seal to be inscribed 'State of Louisiana'. Over head of the Pelican to be inscribed 'Union, Justice', and under the Pelican to be inscribed 'Confidence'."The description of the seal included the motto, which Gov.

50|$|Since 1922, the {{government}} of Ireland has used a similar left-facing harp, based on the Trinity College Harp in the Library of Trinity College Dublin as its state symbol. It first appeared on the Great Seal of the Irish Free State, which in turn {{was replaced by the}} coat of arms, the Irish Presidential Standard and the Presidential Seal in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. The harp emblem is used on <b>official</b> <b>state</b> <b>seals</b> and documents including the Irish passport and has appeared on Irish coinage from the Middle Ages to the current Irish imprints of euro coins.

It is featured on the <b>official</b> Hawaiian <b>state</b> <b>seal</b> (See Seal of Hawaii), and in the logo of the Kamehameha Schools, which has campuses located throughout the Islands. In 1959, a third Kamehameha I statue was cast using models from second cast, and placed in Sanctuary Hall inside the U.S. Capitol Building (See United States Capitol) in Washington, D.C. to honor Hawaii becoming the fiftieth state. Various businesses, especially those working in the tourist trade, have capitalized on the resulting popularity of the sculpture; its image {{has been used to}} decorate brochures, postcards, T-shirts, folk-art, etc., and small reproductions of the sculpture are popular souvenirs in many shops.|$|R
