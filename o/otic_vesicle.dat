40|$|AbstractVertebrate {{inner ear}} {{development}} is {{initiated by the}} specification of the otic placode, an ectodermal structure induced by signals from neighboring tissue. Although several signaling molecules {{have been identified as}} candidate otic inducers, many details of the process of inner ear induction remain elusive. Here, we report that otic induction is responsive to the level of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activity in Xenopus, making use of both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Ectopic activation of Hedgehog signaling resulted in the development of ectopic vesicular structures expressing the otic marker genes XPax- 2, Xdll- 3, and Xwnt- 3 A, thus revealing otic identity. Induction of ectopic <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles</b> was also achieved by misexpression of two different inhibitors of Hh signaling: the putative Hh antagonist mHIP and XPtc 1 ΔLoop 2, a dominant-negative form of the Hh receptor Patched. In addition, misexpression of XPtc 1 ΔLoop 2 as well as treatment of Xenopus embryos with the specific Hh signaling antagonist cyclopamine resulted in the formation of enlarged <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles.</b> In summary, our observations suggest that a defined level of Hh signaling provides a restrictive environment for otic fate in Xenopus embryos...|$|R
50|$|Formation of the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} in developmental model organisms including chick, Xenopus, zebrafish, axolotyl, & mouse. The transition from the otic placode to the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> occurs during the 19th somite stage in Zebrafish, Xenopus, and chick. In chick, invagination of the otic placode occurs passively due to {{the movements of the}} surrounding placode. The otic placode in zebrafish, on the other hand, occurs by cavitation; the ectodermal placode condenses and forms an ovoid ball directly below the embryo surface. <b>Otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> formation occurs later, during the 25-30 somite stage in mice.|$|E
50|$|The {{middle part}} of the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> {{develops}} into the ductus and saccus endolymphaticus.

The central {{part of the}} <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> represents the membranous vestibule, and is subdivided by a constriction into a smaller ventral part, the saccule, and a larger dorsal and posterior part, the utricle.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{inner ear}} arises from a {{specialized}} set of cells, the otic placode, that forms at the lateral {{edge of the}} neural plate adjacent to the hindbrain. Previous studies indicated that fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) are required for otic induction; in zebrafish, loss of both Fgf 3 and Fgf 8 results in total ablation of otic tissue. Furthermore, gain-of-function studies suggested that Fgf signaling is not only necessary but also sufficient for otic induction, although the amount of induced ectopic otic tissue reported after misexpression of fgf 3 or fgf 8 varies among different studies. We previously suggested that Foxi 1 and Dlx 3 b may provide competence to form the ear because loss of both foxi 1 and dlx 3 b results in ablation of all otic tissue even {{in the presence of}} a fully functional Fgf signaling pathway. Results Using a transgenic line that allows us to misexpress fgf 8 under the control of the zebrafish temperature-inducible hsp 70 promoter, we readdressed the role of Fgf signaling and otic competence during placode induction. We find that misexpression of fgf 8 fails to induce formation of ectopic <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles</b> outside of the endogenous ear field and has different consequences depending upon the developmental stage. Overexpression of fgf 8 from 1 -cell to midgastrula stages leads to formation of no or small <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles,</b> respectively. Overexpression of fgf 8 at these stages never leads to ectopic expression of foxi 1 or dlx 3 b, contrary to previous studies that indicated that foxi 1 is activated by Fgf signaling. Consistent with our results we find that pharmacological inhibition of Fgf signaling has no effect on foxi 1 or dlx 3 b expression, but instead, Bmp signaling activates foxi 1, directly and dlx 3 b, indirectly. In contrast to early activation of fgf 8, fgf 8 overexpression at the end of gastrulation, when otic induction begins, leads to much larger <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles.</b> We further show that application of a low dose of retinoic acid that does not perturb patterning of the anterior neural plate leads to expansion of foxi 1 and to a massive Fgf-dependent otic induction. Conclusion These results provide further support for the hypothesis that Foxi 1 and Dlx 3 b provide competence for cells to respond to Fgf and form an otic placode. </p...|$|R

40|$|HMGA {{proteins}} are chromatin “architectural modifiers”, bearing three conserved “AT-hook” motifs {{with which}} they bind to DNA AT-rich regions to assist in gene transcription. We report the developmental expression of Xenopus laevis hmga 2 β (Xhmga 2 β) and of hmgax (Xhmgax), a gene encoding a highly divergent HMGA with eight AT-hooks. Xhmga 2 β transcripts are first detected before the midblastula transition (MBT) by RT-PCR and then become more abundant. By in situ hybridisation (ISH), localized transcripts are first detected at neurula stages, in the presumptive central nervous system (CNS) and eye field. At tailbud and tadpole stages, Xlhmga 2 β mRNA is detected in the CNS, in the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles,</b> in neural crest cell derivatives, in the notochord and in the medio-lateral mesoderm.

OIGCS-β 1 and nNOS were expressed maternally and OIGCS-α 1, OIGCS-α 2, cGK I, and cGK II were expressed zygotically. The zygotic expression of OIGCS-α 1 and cGK / was detected at stage 19, while that of OIGCS-α 2 was detected at stage 16. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that the expression of nNOS or cGK / was localized in tail bud, <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles,</b> thyroid, and brain ventricle, or in thymus, gill arch, and olfactory pits, respectively, and that of OIGCS-α 1, OIGCS-α 2, or OIGCS-β 1 was dim and dispersed throughout the embryos.

50|$|In mouse, frog and fish, Dapper2, is a {{negative}} regulator of mesoderm formation acting through the down-regulation of the Wnt and TGFβ / nodal signaling pathways. In zebrafish, nodal is known to activate the gene expression of dapper2. In the cell surface Dapper2 tightly binds to the active form of the activin type 1 receptors and targets the receptor for lysosomal degradation. Dapper2 overexpression mimics nodal co-receptor loss of function because nodal signal cannot be transduced and therefore it produces less mesoderm. In the mouse embryo, dpr2 mRNA is located across all the embryo 7.5 days post conception (dpc) however its location changes at 8.5-dpc where it is observed at the prospective somites and by 10-dpc, neural tube, <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> and gut; because Dapper2 and Nodal are expressed in the same region, this suggests that Dapper antagonizes mesoderm induction signals derived from Nodal.

E 10. 5 <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> was maintained using the same method, but morphogenesis was less successful. Culture of the E 11. 5 cochlear region alone resulted in regeneration of a structure with semicircular canal character from the cut end, indicating that region-specific cell fate within the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> is not irreversibly determined at this stage. Co-culturing <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> with cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) resulted in enhanced looping or ectopic diverticulum formation of the cochlear region, suggesting that the CVG provides a morphogenetic signal for cochlear looping.

The embryogenesis was typical of teleosteans, but with differences in relation to other species such as duration of development, type of blastocoel, moment of somite segmentation among others. Six stages of embryonic development were defined: zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, organogenesis (divided in phases: early segmentation and late segmentation) and hatching with a period of incubation equal to 13 hours at 29 ºC and 17 hours at 25 ºC. The extruded oocytes presented a mean diameter of 812 µm before and 1066 µm after hydration. When fertilized, they presented a yellowish coloration and a gelatinous layer surrounding the chorion. The cleavage pattern is described as: 2; 4; 8 (4 x 2); 16 (4 x 4); 32 (4 x 8) and 64 (2 x 4 x 8) blastomeres up to morula phase (+ 64 cells). It was also possible to observe at this phase, the beginning of the formation of the yolk syncyctial layer (YSL). Afterwards, the blastula and gastrula stages followed. The end of gastrula was characterized by the formation of the yolk plug. Subsequently, the differentiation between cephalic and caudal regions began, along with the embryo elongation, structuring of optic, Kupffer's and <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles</b> besides a previously unidentified structure in the yolk syncyctial layer.

Moreover, {{they are able to}} maintain regional fate, as is evident by the expression of the hindbrain-specific marker, Krox 20. In addition, we observe that committed hindbrain tissues are able to induce presumptive ventral epidermis to form neural crest derivatives, <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles,</b> and neural tissues.

To investigate {{the role of}} hindbrain signals in instructing <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> regionalisation, we analysed ear development in zebrafish mutants for vhnf 1, a gene expressed in the caudal hindbrain during otic induction and regionalisation. We show that, in vhnf 1 homozygous embryos, the patterning of the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle</b> is affected along both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. First, anterior gene expression domains are either expanded along the whole anteroposterior axis of the vesicle or duplicated in the posterior region.

These results demonstrate that, in zebrafish, signals from the hindbrain control the patterning of the <b>otic</b> <b>vesicle,</b> not only along the anteroposterior axis, but also, as in amniotes, along the dorsoventral axis.

In vertebrates, however, seven RFX genes have been identified. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that Rfx 2 is among the closest homologues of Daf 19. We therefore hypothesize that Rfx 2 broadly controls ciliogenesis during vertebrate development. Indeed, here we show that Rfx 2 in Xenopus is expressed preferentially in ciliated tissues, including neural tube, gastrocoel roof plate, epidermal multi-ciliated cells, <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles,</b> and kidneys. Knockdown of Rfx 2 results in cilia-defective embryonic phenotypes and fewer or truncated cilia are observed in Rfx 2 morphants. These results indicate that Rfx 2 is broadly required for ciliogenesis in vertebrates. Furthermore, we show that Rfx 2 is essential for expression of several ciliogenic genes, including TTC 25, which we show here is required for ciliogenesis, HH signaling, and left–right patterning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Wnt {{family of}} {{signalling}} proteins {{is known to}} participate in multiple developmental decisions during em-bryogenesis. We misexpressed Wnt 1 in medaka embryos and observed anterior truncations, similar to those described for ectopic activation of canonical Wnt signalling in other species. Interestingly, when we induced a heat-shock Wnt 1 transgenic line exactly at 30 % epiboly, we observed multiple ectopic <b>otic</b> <b>vesicles</b> in the truncated embryos. The vesicles then fused, forming a single large ear structure. These “cyclopic ears” filled the complete anterior region of the embryos. The ectopic induction of otic development {{can be explained by}} the juxtaposition of hindbrain tissue with anterior ectoderm. Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) ligands are thought to mediate the otic-inducing properties of the hindbrain. However, signals different from Fgf 3 and Fgf 8 are necessary to explain the formation of the ectopic ear structures, suggesting that Wnt signalling is involved in the otic induction process in medaka...|$|R
