5000|$|Syzygium malaccense is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} tree native to Malaysia, Indonesia (Sumatra and Java) Vietnam, Thailand, New Guinea and Australia. It has been introduced throughout the tropics, including many Caribbean countries and territories such as Jamaica where it is known simply as [...] "Jamaican apple" [...] or the more common <b>Otaheite</b> <b>apple.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Syzygium malaccense has {{a number}} of English common names. It is known as a Malay rose apple, or simply Malay apple, {{mountain}} apple, rose apple, <b>Otaheite</b> <b>apple,</b> pink satin-ash and pommerac (derived from pomme Malac, meaning [...] "Malayan apple" [...] in French). Despite {{the fact that it is}} sometimes called the otaheite cashew, it is not related to cashew. While cashew nuts (but not cashew fruits) may trigger allergic reactions, rose apple fruit has not been observed to do so.|$|E
40|$|High {{ingestion}} of fruits {{has been associated}} with low incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases, probably due to the presence of bioactive compounds in these foods, such as antioxidants. The levels of bioactive compounds - ascorbic acid, total phenolics, flavonoids and carotenoids - were determined in 18 pulps obtained from tropical fruits acquired in Brazil. The free radical scavenger activity was evaluated by the ABTS assay. The fruits that showed higher levels of bioactive compounds were buriti, <b>otaheite</b> <b>apple,</b> egg-fruit, golden spoon, physalis, piquia and star nut palm. Considering the composition of bioactive compounds and free radical scavenger capacities the fruits were divided into five groups, according to Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. Applying Principal Component Analysis, free radical scavenger showed high correlation with total phenolic compounds (r = 0. 99) and flavonoids (r = 0. 86); however, the correlation was found to be very poor with ascorbic acid (r = 0. 02) and with total carotenoids levels (r = 0. 08) ...|$|E

The are organized by geographical location. A pregnant woman buying fruits from street fruit vendors, {{an example of a}} small business enterprise in Jamaica. These self-shoreline made fruit stands have roofs made from palm frond leaves and are supported by tree branches. The tables are covered with bright colored plastic cloths. The fruits include <b>Otaheite</b> <b>apples,</b> nesberries, and mangoes. Under the tables are Dragon Stout and Red Stripe boxes. In the background is a house behind a wire fence.

50|$|The Bath Botanical Gardens were {{established}} in 1779 through a Statute of the Jamaican House of Assembly. The gardens {{were established}} to give visitors to the Bath Mineral Spa a tranquil environment to relax in. These are the second oldest botanical gardens in the Western Hemisphere, being established 14 years after the botanical gardens {{on the island of}} St. Vincent. Many foreign plants were planted in the Bath Botanical Gardens when they were first introduced in Jamaica, including ackee, breadfruit and <b>otaheite</b> <b>apples.</b> It is believed that Jamaica's first breadfruit trees were brought to Bath by Captain Bligh in 1793 and that several other exotic species were introduced in 1782 following the capture of a French vessel by Admiral Rodney.|$|R
