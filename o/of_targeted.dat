5|$|In {{a review}} of the book for the journal International Criminal Justice Review, Robert M. Worley of Penn State Altoona {{comments}} favorably on the comprehensive nature of Melzer's research and his descriptions of the differences of the practice <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing in varying countries. Worley comments on the relevance of the book to scholars in various fields, including history, law, law enforcement, and terrorism analysis. Worley concludes his review by recommending the book for those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on Targeted Killing in International Law, in a review for the European Journal of International Law. He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing. Abresch calls the author's writing style logical, and praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E

The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew more supportive <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing than ever before.

He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection {{of an individual}} person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killing in International Law is a {{book about}} the {{legality}} <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing, written by Nils Melzer. It was first published by Oxford University Press in May 2008. The book explores the history <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing as a government strategy by multiple countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany; for both military and law enforcement purposes. Melzer argues that directly after the September 11 attacks in the United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} occurrence and use <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing in New Zealand Private Training Establishments (PTEs) and examines the level <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing (TC) implementations in different TC PTEs. I {{find that there}} is a relatively moderate adoption rate <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing (33. 3 per cent) in the PTE sector in New Zealand. More than half of these PTEs, which adopted target costing (referred as TC PTEs), have only a basic level <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation. This dissertation also identifies factors that contribute to a more complete implementation <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing in PTEs, by empirically examining the association between eight identified factors and the completeness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation. Five management techniques/tools (factors) {{have been found to be}} significantly associated with the completeness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation: 1) top management support in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing; 2) cross-functional teams; 3) a structural reporting system; 4) performance rewards based on achievement <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costs; and 5) active participation of suppliers and other external stakeholders in the program development. This suggests PTEs with a higher level <b>of</b> <b>target</b> cost implementation are more likely to adopt these techniques/tools. This research also empirically examines the effect <b>of</b> the <b>target</b> costing adoption on cost reduction performance, quality level of services, and customer satisfaction level in the PTE context, as well as the impact <b>of</b> completeness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing implementation on these three aspects. The findings from this study suggest that the adoption <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing has positive influences on cost reduction performance and quality level of services in PTEs. Moreover, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>target</b> costing in reducing cost also increases when the TC PTEs have a more complete target costing implementation...|$|R

5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E
