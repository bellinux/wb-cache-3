5|$|Co-produced by Phil Spector and {{featuring}} the latter's signature Wall of Sound {{in a live}} setting, the fundraiser album was delayed for three months due to protracted negotiations between Harrison and two record companies keen to protect their business interests, Capitol and Columbia/CBS. Besides the main performers, the musicians and singers on the recording include Badfinger, Jim Horn, Klaus Voormann, Alla Rakha, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis and Claudia Linnear. The box set's <b>original</b> <b>packaging</b> included a 64-page book containing photos from the concerts; the album cover, designed by Tom Wilkes, consisted of {{an image of a}} malnourished child sitting beside an empty food bowl.|$|E
5|$|Thick as a Brick is {{the fifth}} studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, {{released}} in March 1972. The album contains a continuous piece of music, split over two sides of an LP record, and was deliberately designed to parody the concept album genre. The <b>original</b> <b>packaging,</b> designed like a newspaper, claims the album to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by the fictional 8-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by the band's frontman, Ian Anderson.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{distinct}} International promotionals was the boxy Metro delivery van which International made from 1948 to about 1959. PMC's Metro {{appears to have been}} made in the later 1950s, and was one of the company's last promotional offerings. It had an opening rear door which slid outward from the rear of the van, revealing storage space inside. This model was offered in a common light yellow, a purple, and a less common lime green. The PMC offering was often packaged in a toy-like plastic bag stapled to a cardboard hanging card. One recent eBay offering of the Metro in <b>original</b> <b>packaging</b> was being sold for $200.00.|$|E
500|$|During the Bicentennial, {{members of}} the Procrastinator's Club of America jokingly picketed the Whitechapel Bell Foundry with signs [...] "We got a lemon" [...] and [...] "What about the warranty?" [...] The foundry told the protesters {{that it would be}} glad to replace the bell—so long as it was {{returned}} in the <b>original</b> <b>packaging.</b> In 1958, the foundry (then trading under the name Mears and Stainbank Foundry) had offered to recast the bell, and was told by the Park Service that neither it nor the public wanted the crack removed. The foundry was called upon, in 1976, to cast a full-size replica of the Liberty Bell (known as the Bicentennial Bell), which was presented to the United States by the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and was housed in the tower once intended for the Liberty Bell, at the former visitor center on South Third Street.|$|E
500|$|An X-ray machine {{scanning}} Halloween candy malfunctions {{and gives}} Bart {{the ability to}} stretch his body like rubber and Lisa super strength. They become a superhero duo, calling themselves [...] "Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl". Later, Lucy Lawless (dressed as Xena) addresses fans at a science fiction convention. Comic Book Guy, who has styled himself as a villain called [...] "The Collector", kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready. The Collector takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized PET film bag for [...] "safekeeping" [...] and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray {{in an attempt to}} free Xena, but they are soon captured as well. The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of [...] "Lucite". After feigning interest in the villain, Lawless starts clobbering him. The Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from [...] (which was released a few months before the episode) and ignites the blades, but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its <b>original</b> <b>packaging,</b> he panics and ends up falling into the Lucite. Lawless then flies the children home (Lisa points out that Xena cannot fly, but Lawless reminds her she's not Xena, she's Lucy Lawless).|$|E

500|$|It {{released}} in August 2011 in major Western regions: it {{released in}} North America on August 23, Australia on August 25, and Europe on August 26. In {{addition to the}} standalone releases, special editions were created featuring extra content in North America and Europe. The [...] "Explosive Mission Pack" [...] included a mission focusing on a central character from Deus Ex along with additional weapons and equipment. The [...] "Augmented Edition" [...] included all content from the [...] "Explosive Mission Pack" [...] in addition to new equipment and in-game bonuses. The European version sported a few extra items than the North American version. A separate pack included codes to unlock Deus Ex-themed items for Team Fortress 2 for pre-orders on Steam. The OS X port released on April 26, 2012. The version released was the [...] "Ultimate Edition", including all pre-order content in addition to downloadable content (DLC) released the previous year. A minor controversy arose around the PC version when video game retailer GameStop started removing content from the <b>original</b> <b>packaging.</b> GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for free access to Human Revolution on OnLive, an online gaming service, stating that the coupon promoted a competitor {{of one of its}} subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had recently acquired. As an apology, GameStop began giving customers a $50 gift card in-store to those who purchased copies of Deus Ex: Human Revolution for PC prior to August 26 and who brought the issue to their staff.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{traditional}} paper packaging, {{the top of}} the stick was intended to be bitten off to form a straw and the sherbet sucked through it, where it fizzes and dissolves on the tongue. The [...] "new" [...] format only includes a solid liquorice stick, so the sherbet must be licked off that, or eaten directly. This method of consumption was also considered acceptable with the <b>original</b> <b>packaging.</b> This is advertised on the packet as [...] "Sherbet with a liquorice dip". This is a different experience from the original paper-wrapped sweet.|$|E

Such items can easily be found as surplus and obtained at very little expense. In the former Soviet Union, Nixies were still being manufactured in volume in the 1980s, so Russian and Eastern European Nixies are still available.|$|E

Although {{it is difficult to}} completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and [...] "open" [...] bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>original</b> <b>packaging</b> of {{the model}} showed the car from various angles and {{a photo of the}} turbine engine on the box.

Further, the box spoke of the flexibility of the engine in its ability to use a variety of different types of fuels and Chrysler encouraged those in possession {{of the model}} to [...] "watch" [...] for the real car, which [...] "will soon be on the streets and highways of America".|$|E

50|$|Once {{the juice}} package is opened, {{or if it}} was not sealed and shipped without needing {{refrigeration}} by the manufacturer, it must be resealed tightly and refrigerated to avoid contamination from microorganisms such as bacteria. The ideal storage temperature for apple juice is between 0 and 4 °C. Depending on the <b>original</b> <b>package</b> of the apple juice, it could help to transfer the contents to a new container. For example, if the <b>original</b> <b>package</b> was a Tetra Pak, which does not permit contact of the product with light, then it is safe to refrigerate as is. However, if the product was initially in a clear glass container, transferring the apple juice into an opaque container would help extend the shelf life of the juice. This may include a thermos or plastic bottle.|$|R
