5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|With a short {{timeframe}} {{to complete}} The Wrath of Khans special effects sequences, effects supervisor Jim Veilleux, Meyer, Jennings, Sallin and Minor worked {{to transform the}} written ideas for the script into concrete storyboards and visuals. The detailed sequences were essential to keep the film's effects from spiraling {{out of control and}} driving up costs, as had occurred with The Motion Picture. Each special and <b>optical</b> <b>effect,</b> and the duration of the sequences, was listed. By the end of six weeks, the producers determined the basic look and construction of nearly all the effects; the resulting shots were combined with film footage five months later. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) produced many of the effects, and created the new models; the Reliant was the first non-Constitution-class Federation starship seen in the series. Originally, the Reliant {{was supposed to be a}} Constitution-class starship identical to the Enterprise, but it was felt audiences would have difficulty distinguishing between the two ships. As the script called for the Reliant and Enterprise to inflict significant damage on each other, ILM developed techniques to illustrate the damage without physically harming the models. Rather than move the models on a bluescreen during shooting, the VistaVision camera was panned and tracked to give the illusion of movement. Damage to the Enterprise was cosmetic, and simulated with pieces of aluminum that were colored or peeled off. Phaser damage was created using stop motion. The script called for large-scale damage to the Reliant, so larger versions of the ship's model were created to be blown up.|$|E

25|$|Iridophores, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} guanophores, are pigment cells that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine. When illuminated they generate iridescent colours {{because of the}} diffraction of light within the stacked plates. Orientation of the schemochrome determines {{the nature of the}} colour observed. By using biochromes as coloured filters, iridophores create an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> known as Tyndall or Rayleigh scattering, producing bright-blue or -green colours.|$|E
25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a globule in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an <b>optical</b> <b>effect,</b> and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E
25|$|Iridophores are {{structures}} that produce iridescent colors with a metallic sheen. They reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine.

By using biochromes as colored filters, iridophores create an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> known as Tyndall or Rayleigh scattering, producing bright blue or blue-green colors. Iridophores vary in size but are generally smaller than 1â€Šmm. It has been shown that squid at least are able to change their iridescence. This takes several seconds or minutes and the mechanism is not understood. However, iridescence can also be altered by expanding and retracting the chromatophores above the iridophores. Because chromatophores are under direct neural control from the brain, this effect can be immediate.|$|E

25|$|The <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> of a TN {{device in}} the voltage-on state {{is far less}} {{dependent}} on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, in particular in smartphones such as iPhones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied {{for a long period}} of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, it was {{impossible}} to time the exact moment of the start and end of the transit because of the phenomenon known as the [...] "black drop effect". This effect was long thought to be due to Venus's thick atmosphere, and initially it was held to be the first real evidence that Venus had an atmosphere. However, recent studies demonstrate that it is an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> caused by the smearing of the image of Venus by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere or imperfections in the viewing apparatus.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{improvements}} in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component achromatic lens of the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer that essentially eliminated comaâ€”an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> that can distort {{the outer edge of the}} image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens [...] in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope. During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers Johann Heinrich MÃ¤dler and Wilhelm Beer used a [...] Fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8Â° south of the equator as their point of reference. (This was later named the Sinus Meridiani, and it would become the zero meridian of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, MÃ¤dler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and MÃ¤dler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature [...] "a".|$|E
2500|$|Blue {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary colours of {{pigments}} in painting and traditional colour theory, {{as well as in the}} RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. [...] Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> known as Rayleigh scattering. [...] An <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes.

40|$|Many {{bright colors}} in nature are {{generated}} by the <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> of biological structures. These intricate structures, combined with the absorption and reflection effects of the chemical pigments within, provide the observed color with high visibility and some other startling optical properties. A prominent example comes from the iridescent colors observed on the wing scales of Morpho, a family of subtropical butterflies. Iridescent color refers to the color which changes with varying viewing angle. It is proposed that a layered structure alternating in refractive indices produces the observed colors on the butterfly wing scales, but this generalized idea does not explain some <b>optical</b> <b>effects</b> observed {{through a variety of}} methods.

Eye colour {{is determined by}} two factors: the pigmentation of the eye's iris and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris. [...] In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black. The appearance of blue, green, and hazel eyes results from the Rayleigh scattering {{of light in the}} stroma, an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky. The irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes, which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light, which is instead reflected out to the viewer.

2500|$|While the {{technical}} {{principles of the}} camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of {{the technical}} concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, theatre setups and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an <b>optical</b> <b>effect</b> and developed {{a state of the}} art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) towards personal images. Western artists and philosophers used the Arab findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. [...] E.g. Leonardo da Vinci used the camera obscura as a model of the eye, RenÃ© Descartes for eye and mind and John Locke started to use the camera obscura as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the camera obscura as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.While the use of the camera obscura has dwindled away, for those who are interested in making one it only requires a few items including: a box, tracing paper, tape, foil, a box cutter, a pencil and a blanket to keep out the light.|$|E
