5|$|Sabri Khalil al-Banna (May 1937– 16 August 2002), {{known as}} Abu Nidal, was {{the founder of}} Fatah - the Revolutionary Council, a militant Palestinian {{splinter}} group more {{commonly known as the}} Abu Nidal Organization (ANO). At the height of its power in the 1970s and 1980s, the ANO was widely regarded as the most ruthless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> groups.|$|E

2500|$|Pappé gives {{more details}} of this {{planning}} process. According to Pappé Ben-Gurion was <b>the</b> architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ethnic cleansing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> [...] "His central role in deciding <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> stemmed from <b>the</b> complete control he exercised over all issues of security and defence in the Jewish community in Palestine." [...] In 1947 Ben-Gurion created what Pappé calls the [...] "Consultancy". This {{was a group of}} eleven people, a combination of military and security figures and specialists on Arab affairs. From October 1947 this group met weekly to discuss issues of security and strategy towards the Arab world and <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities {{prior to}} 2000, the {{majority}} of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year.|$|E
5|$|When the Palestinian National Council (PNC) {{convened in}} Cairo on 3 February 1969, Yahya Hammuda {{stepped down from}} his {{chairmanship}} of the PLO. Arafat was elected chairman on 4 February. He became Commander-in-Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Revolutionary Forces two years later, and in 1973, became {{the head of the}} PLO's political department.|$|E

5|$|According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were {{enrolled}} in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% {{of high school students}} received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.|$|E
5|$|According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, {{approximately}} 84% of Bethlehem's population {{over the}} age of 10 was literate.

25|$|According to Amnesty International <b>the</b> early <b>Palestinian</b> {{casualties}} were those {{taking part in}} demonstrations or bystanders.

25|$|Additionally, private {{groups have}} become {{increasingly}} involved in the conflict, such as the International Solidarity Movement on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> and <b>the</b> American Israel Public Affairs Committee on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israelis.|$|R

5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> people view {{him as a}} heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people. Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against Israeli troops {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Council (PNC). In 1988, {{he was a}} proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E

5|$|In 1978 Atrash {{hosted a}} dinner aimed at healing the rift between the ruling Ba'ath governments of Syria and {{neighboring}} Iraq. The dinner {{was attended by}} such notables as Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz and Syrian defense minister Mustafa Tlass. Between 2000 and 2006 Atrash {{was a member of}} an organization in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> uprising against Israel. Between 2001 and 2006 he presided over the Syrian Arab Committee, which aimed to end the sanctions against Iraq and later support it after the 2003 invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords. Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Authority (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and two women, were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA.|$|E
