500|$|Polka Party! {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Allmusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that [...] "just about anyone could feel let down by this album." [...] Chadbourne was largely {{critical of the}} parody choices, noting {{that many of the}} original versions would be forgotten in [...] "fifteen years". Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault gave Polka Party! an F and described it as an album that [...] "seemed like it could well have been the 'last call' for Yankovic." [...] Thelen heavily criticized the record, writing that both the parodies and originals were not good and that [...] "Yankovic [...] going through the motions". Rolling Stone awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, tying it with the 1992 album Off the Deep End and the 1999 release Running with Scissors as Yankovic's best-rated album. Although it was not a critical success, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1987, but lost to Bill Cosby's Those <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>with</b> or Without Children, You'll Understand.|$|E

2500|$|Fairly {{suddenly}} in the 17th century, thou {{began to decline}} in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in regional dialects of England and Scotland farther from London, {{as well as in}} the language of such religious groups as the Society of Friends. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of thou in the 17th century include the increasing identification <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> [...] "polite society" [...] and the uncertainty of using thou for inferiors versus you for superiors (with you being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.|$|E

2500|$|Caesar {{was able}} to {{pantomime}} {{a wide variety of}} things: a tire, a gumball machine, a lion, a dog, a punching bag, a telephone, an infant, an elevator, a railroad train, a herd of horses, a piano, a rattlesnake and a bottle of seltzer. On the Dick Clark show in 1978, he played a chewing gum machine and a slot machine. He was also able to create imaginary characters. Alfred Hitchcock compared him to Charlie Chaplin, and critic John Crosby felt [...] "he could wrench laughter out <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the violence of his great eyes and the sheer immensity of his parody." [...] In an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1953, show business biographer Maurice Zolotow noted that [...] "Caesar relies upon grunts and grimaces to express a vast range of emotions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In response, the Admiralty issued orders on 10 February 1915 which {{directed}} merchant {{ships to}} escape from hostile U-boats when possible, but [...] "if a submarine comes up suddenly close ahead <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> obvious hostile intention, steer straight for her at your utmost speed..." [...] Further instructions ten days later advised armed steamers to open fire on a submarine {{even if it had}} not yet fired. Given the extreme vulnerability of a submarine to ramming or even small-caliber shellfire, a U-boat that surfaced and gave warning against a merchantman which had been given such instructions was putting itself in great danger. The Germans knew of these orders, even though they were intended to be secret, copies having been obtained from captured ships and from wireless intercepts; Bailey and Ryan in their [...] "The Lusitania Disaster", put much emphasis on these Admiralty orders to merchantmen, arguing it was unreasonable to expect a submarine to surface and give warning under such circumstances. In their opinion this, rather than the munitions, the nonexistent armament, or any other suggested reason, is the best rationale for the Germans' actions in the sinking.|$|E
2500|$|The {{battles between}} Kodavas and Tippu Sultan {{is one of}} the most bitter rivalries in South India. There were {{repeated}} attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father Hyder Ali before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, [...] "If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> Islam", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realized conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners.|$|E
