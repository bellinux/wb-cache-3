40|$|The {{introduction}} <b>of</b> innovative <b>fishery</b> {{policies in}} New Zealand has recently attracted international attention. The introduction of an ITQ system was {{premised on the}} notion of Crown ownership <b>of</b> <b>fishery</b> resources. Conflict has accompanied these policies as Maori people have challenged the government over ownership <b>of</b> <b>fishery</b> resources and declaimed the skewed impact <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> policies. This paper examines the source of these problems focussing particularly on the Treaty of Waitangi negotiated in 1840 between the Crown and heads of Maori tribes. The Treaty guaranteed to Maori the full, exclusive and undisturbed possession <b>of</b> their <b>fisheries</b> and other properties, guarantees which were until recently ignored.

Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case.

5|$|Fish {{caught off}} the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador are {{required}} to have a minimal level of processing done in provincial fish plants. The objective is to ensure that the province’s fishery generates the maximum economic and employment benefits for the province.These requirements are known as minimum processing requirements, or MPRs. These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost of processing, labour availability and because some markets are interested in less processed fish. The Minister <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries</b> and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E

5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries,</b> writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries</b> and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} divided into three phases, {{expected}} to cost a total of $68million. Phase1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, {{and the construction of}} dikes and aboiteaux; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase2 consists of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both upstream and downstream, for two years. Phase3, commenced in 2012, consisted of the bridge's development and the removal of the causeway, and is anticipated to be completed in 2015. Confusion arose {{as to whether or not}} the project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries</b> and Oceans, which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government came forward with an initial $20million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.|$|E

5|$|While {{extremely}} severe {{commercial and}} recreational overfishing in the 1800s {{and the early}} 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod, overfishing by recreational fishermen, aided by inadequate fishing regulations, continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod. The current size limit of 60centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod. This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70centimetres and reducing the bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long-term viability of wild Murray cod populations. As of November 2014, the NSW Department <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries</b> has introduced a maximum size limit of 75cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish, {{as well as a}} new minimum size limit of 55cm.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries</b> and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
