40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{aesthetic}} impacts of wind farm <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting.</b> The research problems investigated in this study were; aviation safety regulations for wind farm <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting</b> in different countries, <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting</b> technology, and the public attitudes towards wind farming. The research was designed taking into account the research problems, questions, and the researcher experience. Hence, mixed method approach was employed to collect as much, and as diverse data as possible. The sample was drawn focusing wind energy project developers, operators, and the owners. Seeking to build a detailed narrative, a web-based survey was conducted to gather the thoughts, and opinions of the sample population, in addition, to a thorough literature review conducted earlier. The key findings of this study are that the lighting system should be efficient to operate in terms of technology with least aesthetic impacts. Out-dated wind farm <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting</b> systems are annoying, and contributes to overall aesthetic impacts that triggers nagetive attitudes towards wind farming. In addition, for wind farms near any aerodrome, infrared integrated into light emitting diodes <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting</b> have minimal aesthetic impacts. Whereas, the radar-activated <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting</b> is a better choice for wind farms further away from aerodromes. The study argued that understanding the affecting components of attitudes would give various stakeholders a realistic understanding about attitudes towards wind farming. This study concludes that the optimization of lighting angle, intensity, color, and luminance will help reducing the aesthetic impacts under the prevailing regulations, and mapping affective components of attitudes will help in better understanding the public support towards wind farming...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand and}} need for {{alternative}} obstruction marking has become a significant challenge for the wind power development in Sweden. While the development of wind turbines pushes for higher heights, the need to denote them as possible obstacles for aviation increase. To reduce undesired effects of the aviation warning lights in the landscape, various technologies for reducing the light emitted have been developed. One of these technologies control the lights’ output by dimming them based on measurements of the prevailing visibility {{in the vicinity of}} the wind farm. Visibility controlled <b>obstruction</b> <b>lighting</b> has not yet been used in Swedish wind farms. This thesis will investigate how a system can be applied from different viewpoints and what would be gained in a wind farm in northern Sweden. By reviewing literature, interviewing key-persons, studying a case with application of Finnish regulations and estimating the performance during different conditions, and discussing the results, conclusions could be drawn. The findings are general recommendations for acceptance, an aviation risk that need to be considered, indications of preferable regulation applications and approximations of the performance and possible gain...|$|E

50|$|Drawbacks of {{line-of-sight}} systems include <b>obstructions,</b> <b>lighting</b> {{and atmospheric}} conditions, and undesired activations. Obstructions may be buildings on a curving road that block visual {{contact with a}} traffic signal until very close, or perhaps a large freight truck {{in front of a}} police car blocking the traffic signal from receiving the emitter's signal from the police car. Modifying the position of the receiver or even locating it separate from the traffic signal equipment can sometimes correct this problem. Direct sunlight into a receiver may prevent it from detecting an emitter, and severe atmospheric conditions, such as heavy rain or snow, may reduce the distance at which a line-of-sight system will function. Undesired activations may occur if an emitter's signal is picked up by many traffic lights along a stretch of road, all directed to change to red in that direction, prior to the activating vehicle turning off the road, or being parked without its emitter being deactivated.|$|R
5000|$|Radio-based traffic-preemption systems using a local, {{short-range}} {{radio signal}} in the 900MHz band, can usually avoid {{the weaknesses of}} line-of-sight systems (2.4 GHz and optical). A radio-based system still uses a directional signal transmitted from an emitter, but being radio-based, its signal is not blocked by visual <b>obstructions,</b> <b>lighting</b> or weather conditions. Until recently, the major drawback of radio-based traffic signal preemption systems was the possibility of interference from other devices that may be using the same frequency {{at a given time}} and location. The advent of FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) broadcasting has allowed radio-based systems to not only overcome this limitation, but also the aforementioned limitations associated with acoustic and line of sight (optical) systems. It was not until recently that cost effective GPS preemption systems were introduced, supplanting FHSS radio-based preemption as the preemption method of choice, particularly for cities that had experienced the myriad of issues associated with other (acoustic and optical) preemption systems.|$|R

The center of gravity of the cars and engine was brought as low as possible, thereby lessening the effect of leverage caused by wind pressure. The smooth, even surface of the exterior of the entire train served to decrease the resistance to the wind, and permitted a high rate of speed.|$|R

40|$|General Mitchell International Airport (MKE) {{located in}} Milwaukee, WI, has many {{man-made}} perching sites used by hawks. Several {{of these sites}} {{need to be addressed}} to improve air operations safety because of the preference by redtailed hawks. The first perching sites addressed at MKE were six lamp posts {{at the base of the}} 128 th Air Refueling Wing of the Wisconsin Air National Guard, which were used daily by red-tailed hawks. In order to mitigate the perching, umbrella skeletons (Daddi Long Legs™ or Bird Spider™) were recommended to be attached to the top of each lamp post. After installation of the skeletons, perching was reduced from daily to none. The effectiveness of the skeletons on the lamp posts led to a consultation with FAA technicians to request the skeletons be placed on top of several pieces of FAA equipment (i. e., glide slope towers). During these same meetings, the technicians stated plastic cable ties could be used on the antennae and <b>obstruction</b> <b>lights</b> on the glide slopes as a deterrent for red-tailed hawk perching. It has been commonly mentioned that these devices cannot be installed because of interference with sensitive equipment; therefore, an evaluation was conducted. Cable ties and an umbrella skeleton were attached to one of three glide slopes and a flight check was conducted to determine if these devices might interfere with equipment operation. Anti-perching equipment did not interfere with glide slope operation; therefore, an umbrella skeleton and cable ties are scheduled to be placed on one additional glide slope at MKE. There are ongoing adjustments for cable tie spacing and required number for effectiveness but these devices have reduced the perching area used be red-tailed hawks at MKE. Further research is necessary to determine longevity, effectiveness, and potential interference issues of these devices...|$|R

Visible light may be used, but infrared radiation conceals the operation of the device and typically is used in modern systems. Originally, systems used lamps powered by direct current or the power line alternating current frequency, but modern photodetector systems use an infrared light-emitting diode modulated at a few kilohertz, which allows the detector to reject stray light and improves the range, sensitivity and security of the device.|$|R
40|$|This degree project, Life cycle {{assessment}} of radio relay systems, {{was conducted at}} Telia AB, Telia Network Services AB, Farsta, and the section of Industrial Ecology of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool with which {{it is possible to}} calculate the environmental load from a product, material or service during all the phases in its life cycle. The results presented in this study are based on such an LCA. Radio relay is an alternative to optical fibre cables, but little information was available within Telia on the environmental impact from the use of radio relay systems as a transmission media. The goal of the project is to provide Telia with useful information regarding the systems involved and where and how the environment is affected by the use of the systems. Two types of radio links are looked at in this project: one high capacity, long hop radio link, and one low capacity radio link. The high capacity link is the Nera NL 290, a Norwegian radio link system with an n+ 1 STM 1 capacity. This system is of an older, bulky design. The second radio link in the study is the Ericsson Mini-link E. This radio link {{is one of the most}} common radio links on the market. Six scenarios, or cases, are the basis for the study: two Nera NL 290 cases, two Mini-link E cases, and two optical fibre cable cases. For all systems, there is one worst case scenario, and one best case scenario. The best case scenarios are distinguished by having a higher capacity overall, and covers longer distances. The best case scenarios have the following properties - Product (distance between stations [km] (capacity [Mbps])) : •Optical fibre cable (50 (2. 5 Gbps)) •Nera NL 290 radio link (50 km (310) •Ericsson Mini-link E radio link (30 (34)) The worst case scenarios have the following properties: •Optical fibre cable (30 (155) •Nera NL 290 radio link (30 (155)) •Ericsson Mini-link E radio link (15 (4  2)) Included in the study are production of materials constituting the systems, transports to and from building sites, manufacture of radio links, infrastructure, network elements, and station equipment. The results of the study are: •No clear difference can be seen between the use of radio links or buried optical fibre cables as a transmission media in regards to the environmental impact. •The environmental impact is mainly dependent on the capacity, and secondarily on the distance. •Optical fibre cables have one phase that is clearly more polluting than the res, and that is the actual work of burying the cable in the ground. •The Nera NL 290 is a radio link system with a relatively high content of circuit boards in the construction. •For the Ericsson Mini-link E, there is no obvious phase that is more polluting than the rest, but the overall environmental load is high. •The operation, or use, of the different systems gives an almost negligible contribution to the total environmental load. Suggestions for improvement: •When planning new routes for optical fibre cables, the direction should be chosen so that as much as possible of the cable can be buried with ploughing. •For optical fibre cables, strive to build the cable together with other construction efforts. •Secure the cable installation for the long term. •For radio links, use existing infrastructure to as high degree as possible. •Build flexible systems that can handle additional capacity with upgrades. •When building new infrastructure for radio relay or mobile phone sites, endeavour to build the mast/tower on solid rock base. •The use of LED-type <b>obstruction</b> <b>lights</b> canwww. ima. kth. s...|$|R
40|$|Daylighting is {{recognized}} as {{an important element in}} architecture and a useful strategy in energy-efficient building designs. Daylight gives a sense of cheeriness and brightness that can have a significant positive impact on the people. There is a scope for integrating daylight with electric light to reduce building energy use. The amount of daylight entering a building is mainly through window openings, which create in the indoor environment a more attractive and pleasing atmosphere, in addition to maximise visual access to the pleasant views of the outside world. Determinations of the exterior and interior daylight and lighting energy savings are key issues to demonstrate the benefits based on daylighting designs. This paper provides a review of daylight illuminance determinations and the lighting energy reductions due to daylighting schemes.
