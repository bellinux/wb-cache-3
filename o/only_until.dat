5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43AD. This lasted <b>only</b> <b>until</b> around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 on 21 September Cevat Pasa (also {{known as}} Jevat Pasa), the Eighth Army commander, left Nablus by car for Mustafa Kemal's Seventh Army {{headquarters}} with {{his chief of}} staff and some staff officers.

5|$|The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) was a single-seat {{shipboard}} attack aircraft {{built for}} the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved troublesome and remained in frontline service <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 1950, when the Navy switched to the smaller and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. A few were built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional crewman in the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The Peabody Orchestra, {{formed in}} 1866, {{was the first}} {{professional}} orchestra in Baltimore. The Orchestra premiered many works in its early years, including some by Asger Hamerik, a prominent Danish composer who became director of the Orchestra. Ross Jungnickel founded the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra before 1890, when the Orchestra first performed, and the Peabody Orchestra ceased to exist. Jungnickel's orchestra, however, lasted <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 1899.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, she was {{assigned}} as the tender {{for the new}} dreadnought battleships of the I Battle Squadron. While in the II Squadron, she wore a white identification band on her funnel, to distinguish her from her sister Pfeil, which wore a yellow identification stripe. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was mobilized as a coastal defense ship, though this duty lasted <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 1915. That year, {{she returned to her}} fleet tender duties; she served in this capacity {{for the remainder of the}} war. She was stricken from the naval register on 8 March 1921, and sold for 520,000marks. She was broken up for scrap later that year in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|In an oddity, Greinke {{became the}} first pitcher to start three {{straight}} games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just 4 pitches for angrily throwing {{the ball into the}} ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted <b>only</b> <b>until</b> the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after 5 innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in the 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day. Overall, Grienke finished the 2011 year with a 16-6 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts in 28 starts.|$|E
5|$|In late May, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion was {{deployed}} {{to support the}} defensive operations in the Chateau–Thierry Sector. During this time they were employed as a complete unit {{in order to provide}} concentrated fire support at key points along the Allied line. The 77th and 81st Companies were assigned to the right flank while the 15th and 23rd Companies were assigned to the left. Their job was to lay down covering and harassing fire during both defensive and offensive operations. They also assisted the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments in their respective drives through Belleau Wood. On 10 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Major Cole, was mortally wounded and command temporarily passed to Captain Harlan E. Major. Captain George H. Osterhout took over on 11 June; however, he remained in command <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 21 June, when Major Littleton Waller officially took over.|$|E

5|$|Newly hatched chicks {{are covered}} with whitish down, and are blind and largely {{helpless}} (nidicolous). Their eyes begin to open on day 6 and are fully open by day 15. The juvenile feathers begin growing through the down from days 7 to 10, covering the baby owls by two weeks of age. Their mother broods them continuously for the first week, then in the day <b>only</b> <b>until</b> the third week. Her partner brings food to the nest, which she tears into pieces before feeding the nestlings. The young vomit up pellets and defecate in the nest, which becomes quite smelly. They leave the nest five to six weeks after hatching, by which time they are fully feathered, with downy head and underparts and short tails. The tail reaches its adult length by 65 to 70 days. Young boobooks lose the remainder of their downy feathers by around five months of age.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army {{headquarters}} at Nablus was abandoned at 15:00 on 21 September, when Jevad join the Seventh Army headquarters, {{accompanied by his}} chief of staff and some staff officers. This move signalled the end of the Ottoman Eighth Army. The 20th and 21st Regiments existed <b>only</b> <b>until</b> the afternoon. All surviving remnants were in retreat and threatened with encirclement, including the Asia Corps. Von Oppen with 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman soldiers of the 16th and 19th Divisions, was retreating northwards towards Beisan when he learned it had fallen. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order a rearguard action. However, Jevad, (also known as Jevat Pasa and Cevat Pasa) the commander of the Eighth Army ordered him to cross the Jordan River.|$|E
5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E

5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power <b>only</b> <b>until</b> his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and a longing for Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson was {{an early}} and {{lifetime}} supporter of the National Council of Labour Colleges, established in 1921 with NUDAW backing {{with the aim of}} educating working-class students in working-class principles. She became a NUDAW-sponsored parliamentary candidate, and in 1923, while still a CPGB member, sought nomination as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for the Gorton constituency. She was unsuccessful, but in November 1923 the Gorton ward elected her to Manchester City Council; Hannah Mitchell, her co-worker in prewar suffrage campaigns, was a fellow councillor. In her short council career—she served <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 1926—Wilkinson's main areas of concern were unemployment, housing, child welfare and education.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the first shots from the Royal Battery, the French {{defenses}} opposite fell silent, the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries. British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment, and at 16:30 flags of truce were raised over the city's bastions. Clermont's offer requested a 24-hour ceasefire to negotiate terms, but Braithwaite allowed <b>only</b> <b>until</b> 08:00 the following morning, during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue. Clermont, isolated and unsupported, accepted the terms, and the following morning Braithwaite's army entered the city and took possession, although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were too drunk to surrender formally.|$|E
