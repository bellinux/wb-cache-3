This medium is composed of two phases, namely solid matrix and entrapped fluid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Open-celled</b> {{solid-state}} foams {{are expected}} to have many applications, such as filtration, biochemical sensing, and tissue engineering scaffolding. For bio-related applications, the solid-state foaming process has a unique advantage, i. e., the process does not involve any organic solvent that could leave residues harmful to biological cells. The disadvantage, however, is that solid-state foams are mostly close-celled and do not allow biological cells or fluids to permeate through. This article presents a parametric study on a novel fabrication method to create <b>open-celled</b> solid-state foams using ultrasound.

40|$|Metal foams, {{especially}} close-celled foams, {{are generally}} regarded as poor sound absorbers. This paper studies the sound absorption behaviour of the <b>open-celled</b> Al foams manufactured by the infiltration process, and the mechanisms involved. The foams show a significant improvement in sound absorption compared with close-celled Al foams, because of their high flow resistance. The absorption performance can be further enhanced, especially at low frequencies, if the foam panel is backed by an appropriate air gap. Increasing the air-gap depth usually increases both the height and {{the width of the}} absorption peak and shifts the peak towards lower frequencies. The foam samples with the smallest pore size exhibit the best absorption capacities when there is no air gap, whereas those with medium pore sizes have the best overall performance when there is an air gap. The typical maximum absorption coefficient, noise reduction coefficient and half-width of the absorption peak are 0. 96 – 0. 99, 0. 44 – 0. 62 and 1500 – 3500 Hz, respectively. The sound dissipation mechanisms in the <b>open-celled</b> foams are principally viscous and thermal losses when there is no air-gap backing and predominantly Helmholtz resonant absorption when there is an air-gap backing. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{analysis}} on cell morphology of polymer blends foam in different nucleating agent and vibration field. The addition of the nucleating agent promote the nucleating and improve the density of foam. The vibration influences the nucleating agent distribution in the polymer matrix. At the same time, the vibration make the walls between cells thinned, the bubble merged. Backgroud Foaming process variables affect three stages of foaming such as the formation of uniform polymer/gas solution, cell nucleation and cell growth, and therefore have impact on the cellular structure and ultimate properties of the foam products[1 - 13]. In microcellular foam, a single bubble nucleates and grows until it contacts other bubbles on all sides. To maintain a microcellular structure, the nuclei of neighboring bubbles must be close enough to impinge and limit the bubble. Therefore, a critical nucleation density is required for cells to impinge and form a microcellular structure. To create an <b>open-celled</b> morphology in this foam, the thin walls between cells must be broken. If these cell walls rupture spontaneously, the <b>open-celled</b> structure can be generated without additional processing steps, equipment, or additives.

40|$|Structured session: "New {{materials}} and systems in building acoustics"International audienceA research {{program has been}} initiated in January 2002 in order to link microstructure of high porosity <b>open-celled</b> foams with their acoustic properties. This paper is intended to highlight the main results of this study. The general objective of this work is {{the determination of the}} acoustical macro-behavior at the local scale of real rigid-framed porous media. In this purpose, one needs first to determine the local geometry of the media, and second to solve in it the partial differential equations which govern dissipation phenomena by thermal and viscous effects. The first step has been overcome by the modern technique of Computed Micro Tomography (CMT). This leads to experimental identification of the parameters of an idealized periodic unit-cell. The second step, the resolution of the linearized heat and viscous fluids equations under harmonic regime, is performed using Brownian motion simulations and finite element methods respectively, in three-dimensional and equivalent two dimensional unit-cells. Macroscopic behavior is obtained by spatial averaging of the local and frequency-dependant thermal and velocity fields. Results are presented in terms of only two frequency-dependant functions, taking into account the long-wavelength sound absorption and propagation properties of an air filled media; and compared with standing waves tube measurements.
