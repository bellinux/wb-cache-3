Romney told the Associated Press that he did not recall pornography having come up for discussion while he had served on the board; and he said that he was unaware of how much revenue the hotels may have generated from pornography.|$|E

40|$|Sports promote fun, {{physical}} fitness, {{and healthy}} competition among children. But too often, <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> sidelined {{for reasons that}} are largely avoidable. More than one in three children who play team sports are injured seriously enough to miss practices or games, and some suffer life-long consequences. While cuts and bruises may heal rather quickly, broken bones, knee injuries, and concussions can require weeks and even years for recovery. No parent intentionally places their young athletes at risk. Many have taken the necessary steps to protect their kids before, during, and after play by taking them for pre-participation physical exams and making emergency contact information easily accessible. Yet misperceptions and uninformed behaviors are all too common, resulting in overuse injuries, dehydration, concussions, or worse.

40|$|This review {{investigates the}} {{potential}} implications of Putnam’s recent book Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis {{for the field}} of social sport sciences. The main themes in Putnam’s <b>Our</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>are</b> class segregation and the widening ‘opportunity’ gap between the ‘have’ and ‘have nots’ in American society. The question can {{and needs to be}} asked: what the impact of class-based segregation has been on ‘our sport clubs’? Furthermore, Putnam also discusses the importance and unequal provision of Extracurricular activities. Putnam sees such activities as contexts for developing social skills, a sense of civic engagement and even for generating upward mobility. An important advantage of such activities is, according to Putnam, the exposure to caring adults outside the family, who can often serve as valuable mentors. However, throughout the book, Putnam uses a rather judgmental and moralizing language when talking about the parents of the ‘have nots’. The lesson that sport researchers can learn from this is to be sensitive and critical to moralizing approaches and deficiency discourses regarding the inclusion in and through sport of children and youth living in poverty...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{study investigated the}} decision-making process utilized by three el-ementary schools in adopting the 200 -day calendar initiative in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The schools in the study represented three distinct sets of demograph-ics focusing primarily on high, middle, and low socioeconomic characteristics, {{as reported by the}} Archdiocese. Principals, pastors, parent representatives, and school advisory council representatives were interviewed. The current study outlines the decision-making process by the school leadership, the reactions to the decision by the stakeholders, and finally, the reasons why these three schools chose to extend their school calendar. Findings suggest that the autonomous leadership and governance structure of the elementary schools in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles allowed schools to utilize a context-specific decision-making process, where once school pastors and principals agreed to the decision, the initiative was adopted at the schools. Reasons for the extension vary by school. The question of school day expansion and calendar extension in improv-ing student learning is part of the educational discourse across the na-tion (e. g., Johnson & Spradlin, 2007; Silva, 2007). Secretary of Educa-tion Arne Duncan emphasized in his interview with Richard Stengel (2009) of TIME magazine, “I think the school day is too short, the school week is too short and the school year is too short. ” Duncan further states in the article, “You look at all the creative schools that are getting dramatically better results. The common denominator of all of them is they’re spending more time, doing more after school, doing more on Saturdays, doing more over the summer. The other big issue is that ultimately if we don’t do more time, <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> at a competitive disadvantage. ” Superintendent of Elementary Schools of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles Kevin Baxter (2011) joins in that discourse by affirming Duncan’s belief in a longer school year when he says...|$|E

40|$|Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U. S. C. 6301 et seq.) and {{subsequent}} reauthorizations require the United States Department of Education to distribute funding to states that ultimately goes to {{local school districts}} {{for the purpose of}} improving the academic achievement of disadvantaged students, including English Language Learners (ELLs). In New Mexico, 64 % of public school students participate in Title I programs, and 16 % of all New Mexico students are ELLs. However, no studies to date have explored how New Mexico public school districts are implementing Title I with respect to English Language Learners. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to conduct document review and to survey and interview Title I Directors in New Mexico school districts to determine how Title I is implemented with respect to English Language Learners. Results indicated that ELL students participate in New Mexico Title I Programs. Results also indicated that, in addition to the academic needs of students in general, ELLs in Title I Programs in New Mexico have additional needs based on their academic English skills, and in some cases, poverty. To meet these needs, bilingual programs, including the dual language model, are common within the organizational structures. Study participants revealed that collaboration, bilingual education programs, and parent involvement play key roles in fostering the goals of Title I. Significantly, study participants did not indicate that they treat ELLs as a burden. Rather, when thinking about the ELLs in their districts, directors understand these are the students they are serving. As one director exclaimed, “That’s who <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are.</b> ” These results have important implications for optimizing the education of ELL students in New Mexico, including improvements in organizational structures, improved programs for parents, and increases in professional development. Combined, the findings of this study highlight how New Mexico public school districts are implementing Title I with respect to English Language Learners.

40|$|The Victorian premier’s {{performance}} on {{education is not}} bad. It’s just not top class, either, according to David Hayward I KNOW Steve Bracks well enough to realise that he’s got to be severely provoked before he loses his cool. His terse rejoinder to the Age’sKenneth Davidson (‘How my government has rebuilt state education’, 19 September) {{tells me that he}} has been wronged. But what if Davidson is not to blame? Davidson argued (‘Bracks has pulled a swifty over education funding’) that education dollars have been falling in real terms in recent times, but the budget papers are so crook these days you would need a degree to work it out. Bracks reckons that Davidson got his numbers wrong ‘again’ because ideology has blinded him to the facts. Labor has invested an ‘additional 3. 7 billion’ in education and there are 4000 extra staff to prove it, not to mention falling student-teacher ratios, and lots of new schools as well as refurbished ones in which <b>our</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> now taught. All this sounds compelling, but maybe things are more complex than the premier would allow? There’s certainly something fishy going on, for Bracks’s numbers don’t add up. At November’s state election, Labor claimed it had put ‘more than 2. 75 billion back into Victoria’s education system’. Yet the budget papers show that education expenses climbed by only 1. 2 billion (budget paper No. 2, page 297) during Labor’s first term, or a little over half that if we adjust for inflation. Bracks now reckons his government is spending 3. 7 billion more. In the one budget since the election, Labor announced new output and investment initiatives worth only 189 million for the next financial year. So where is the missing 800 million? Maybe it’s money that has not been spent yet. The budget these days shows the cost of new initiatives {{over the next four years}} and it’s the total cost the government quotes when it informs us of its generosity. Thus the latest budget injects 2. 4 million into principals’ professional development, but in reality this is an annual 600, 000 that has been multiplied by four. And while some initiatives take full effect immediately, others don’t kick in for some time down the track. Thus, while 82 million is to be spent on 450 new secondary teachers, only 4. 5 million is earmarked for the present financial year, and the big dollars won’t flow till 2005. What all this means is that Bracks’s 3. 7 billion as well as the 2. 75 billion touted at the last election perhaps owe more to double counting than they do to reality. In addition, they include depreciation and a fictional ‘capital asset charge’, in which Treasury gives each department an amount of money equivalent to its annual cost of capital, which is then promptly returned to Treasury in full. To these ‘fictional’ sums must be added superannuation expenses, which have no bearing on day-to-day running costs of schools. For those interested in cash flows over time, or real spending trends by function, the budget papers these days are of no use. These crucial figures have not been published since the 1990 s, when Alan Stockdale decided Victorians should no longer be troubled with this sort of basic information. The only way to solve this problem is to focus on cash spent on salaries and supplies, which are shown in the budget papers, but only for the past two years. This is what Davidson did - and they show that real education spending is declining. But one need not go to these lengths to show that education has not fared all that well. However they are measured, education expenses this year will account for a smaller share of Victoria’s economy than they did in Jeff Kennett 2 ̆ 7 s last year, and all the other states will spend more of their income on education than we will, except probably NSW. While Bracks is right to say that ‘Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s proportion of recurrent expenditure devoted to employing teachers is significantly above the national average’, that’s not something that Labor should necessarily treat with pride. It means we underspend on curriculum development and renewal, to the long-term detriment of our education system. This is about to worsen, for 300 poor souls in head office are about to be made redundant courtesy of budget cuts announced last May, taking staff numbers there back to levels not seen since 1999. What about teacher numbers? While 3000 more teachers have been employed, there are still almost 3000 fewer than there were when Kennett started sacking them way back in 1993. This is not to say that Labor’s education record is bad. It’s just not a top-class effort, which is what Bracks would seem to believe. But premiers are busy people and they depend on others for advice. Our normally good-natured premier might do well to have a word with those whose rubbery numbers got him fired up enough to have an unnecessary scrap with the bearer of some uncomfortable news.
