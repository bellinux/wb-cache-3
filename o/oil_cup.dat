This was Chappell's first series as a coach, in which Pathan played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33.83 at an economy rate of 4.41, but conceded 0/59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final. He scored 58 runs at 29.00 including an unbeaten 36 after India's batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match.|$|E
25|$|A {{contract}} squabble {{between the}} West Indies Players' Association and the West Indies Cricket Board meant that several players, including Bradshaw, {{refused to sign}} contracts for the 2005 tour of Sri Lanka, and Bradshaw did thus not feature in the Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> ODI tournament during this tour.|$|E

The West Indies failed to qualify for the final but Smith finished the tournament with respectable averages of 31.75 with the bat and 40.00 with the ball.|$|E
25|$|India's first tournament under Chappell was the 2005 Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> in Sri Lanka, with Rahul Dravid captaining the team. This {{came about}} after Ganguly was serving a 4 match {{suspension}} for slow over rates during the series against Pakistan in early 2005. The tournament saw Chappell introduce young batsmen such as Suresh Raina and Venugopal Rao, {{due to the}} suspension of Ganguly and the axing of V. V. S. Laxman. With Ganguly's suspension expiring, he was reinstated as the captain on the tour to Zimbabwe. Ganguly entered the series having not scored a Test century {{for almost two years}} since late 2003, when he scored 144 against Australia in Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladeshi cricket team toured Sri Lanka {{for three}} One Day International cricket matches and two Test cricket matches in August and September 2005. The Bangladeshi team {{is coming off}} a {{moderately}} successful tour of England, by their standards, as they pushed Australia close in one ODI and beat them in another. However, they still lost five out of six matches in the NatWest Series, and both of the Test matches, and remain at the bottom of both the ICC Test Championship and ICC ODI Championship. The hosts Sri Lanka, meanwhile, are undefeated in home ODI tournaments since February 2004, and in home Test series since March 2004, both against the top-ranked Australia. Their win in the Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> a month before this series saw them into second place in the ODI Championship, but they are only ranked sixth in Tests.|$|E

25|$|When the West Indies toured Sri Lanka in July and August 2005, the 19-year-old Ramdin was {{the only}} wicket-keeper in the 15-man squad, taking over from the {{incumbent}} Courtney Browne. Brown did not play international cricket after he was replaced by Ramdin and retired later that year {{at the age of}} 34. At the time of his selection, Ramdin had played in just first-class games of experience with three scores above fifty including one century. On Test debut Ramdin scored 56runs before he was bowled by Gayan Wijekoon who was also playing his first Test. The West Indies embarked on the tour with only three of their first choice players (aside from captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul the rest of the West Indies players had just one Test century between them) because of a dispute over sponsorship and as expected lost both Tests. The Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> 2005 with Sri Lanka and India followed the Tests and Ramdin played his first ODIs in the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Upul Tharanga {{made another}} big score as Sri Lanka once again batted Bangladesh {{out of the}} game. The left-hander, who had a disappointing run in the Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> a month earlier, now hit plenty of {{boundaries}} into the off side, as he and Sanath Jayasuriya flayed the Bangladeshi pacers Tapash Baisya, Syed Rasel and Nazmul Hossain. Admittedly, Tharanga had a slice of luck early on, as Manjural Islam Rana dropped him at slip on 13, but he never failed from there. In the opening 15 overs, Tharanga and Jayasuriya added 100 runs, before Jayasuriya finally edged a short-pitched ball behind to wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud. A slower period followed, as number 3 Dilshan was more cautious against the seam bowlers, spending an hour at the crease but only making 27. Tharanga, however, accumulated singles well off the spinners, keeping the run rate well above five an over to end with 105 before Rana got his revenge - Tharanga came down the pitch to Rana, but missed the ball, and was stumped by Masud.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, India had {{not been}} doing as well in One-day Internationals. The players who took India to great heights {{over the past ten}} years such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble grew older and did not {{maintain}} their form and fitness. Following the series loss to Australia, India collapsed on the final day in the Third Test in Bangalore in early 2005 against Pakistan to squander a series victory, and then lost four consecutive ODIs against Pakistan. This was exacerbated by the suspension handed to captain Ganguly for slow over-rates. Greg Chappell took over from John Wright as the new coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and replaced Kumble and V. V. S. Laxman from the ODI team with younger players. India's unconvincing ODI form continued, scraping past a West Indian team depleted by industrial action in the 2005 Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> and a similarly depleted Zimbabwean team only to be defeated twice in the finals by New Zealand, continuing a poor ODI finals record.|$|E

The series is based on the 2005 CASCAR Sportsman series rulebook omitting the 2006 additions (HANS device, firesuits for ‘over the wall’ crews, etc.). The series first major sponsor in 2007 was Castrol Canada. In January 2009 Lucas Oil came on board as the title sponsor and the series was renamed The Lucas <b>Oil</b> Sportsman <b>Cup.</b> Originally events featured a twin 50 lap format which changed in 2011 to the 100 lap feature still used today.|$|R
25|$|Yuvraj is {{primarily}} a left-handed batsman but can bowl part-time left-arm orthodox spin, which he improved {{in the latter part}} of his career. He is regarded as a better batsman against fast bowling than spin bowling, and cites the Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> 2005 as a turning point in his career. Yuvraj is one of the athletic fielders in the Indian team, fielding primarily at point & covers with a good aim at the stumps. Yuvraj is a natural stroke player with an aggressive style of play, as seen by his strike rate of above 150 in T20 internationals & just below 90 in ODIs. Many regard him as one of the best clean strikers of the ball, with his trademark punch through the covers a treat to watch. When in good touch, he can clear the ropes quite effortlessly. A Cricinfo report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting ODI run outs, and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out. He was previously often characterised as having attitude problems, but later often assumed leadership positions during Rahul Dravid's tenure as captain.|$|E
25|$|In July–August 2004 Yuvraj was {{the leading}} run-getter for India in the 2005 Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup</b> {{triangular}} series in Sri Lanka also involving the hosts Sri Lanka and West Indies. He scored 192 runs in four matches, averaging 48. He also recorded his third ODI century during the series – 110 runs from 114 balls (11 fours and one six) – against West Indies at Colombo {{for which he was}} awarded the man of the match. Yuvraj then played in the Videocon Cup in August–September 2005, a triangular series involving India, New Zealand and the hosts Zimbabwe. He averaged 54 with the bat in the series, scoring 216 runs from 5 matches. His innings of 120, in the final round-robin match against Zimbabwe at Harare, helped India recover from a precarious position of 36/4 and successfully chase down the target of 251. It was his fourth ODI hundred and he won the man of the match award for his efforts. In the two-match Test tour of Zimbabwe that followed the tri-series in September, Yuvraj had scores of 12 and 25. In October–November 2005, Yuvraj had a quiet seven-match ODI series at home against Sri Lanka. He managed just 124 runs in six innings at an average of 31 with a top-score of 79*.|$|E
25|$|The Videocon Tri-Series was a three-team One Day International cricket tournament {{taking place}} in Zimbabwe between the hosts Zimbabwe, India and New Zealand. It started on 24 August 2005 and ended with the final on 6 September 2005, which New Zealand won by six wickets. Zimbabwe ended the tournament without a victory against a team other than rock-bottom Bangladesh for 35 ODI matches, since November 2003. Their last series win against a team other than Bangladesh or Kenya was, intriguingly, against New Zealand, in the 2000–01 season. India are still without a tournament win since March 2004, coming off an 18-run defeat by Sri Lanka in {{the final of the}} 2005 Indian <b>Oil</b> <b>Cup,</b> while New Zealand were {{comprehensively}} defeated 5–0 by Australia at home in their last series before this tournament. Before that, however, they were undefeated in six tournaments. The Supersub rule, which means that a player can be substituted for another at any time, but once the player is off he can not return, was introduced for this tournament. The stand-out performances came from Indian Mohammad Kaif, who hit 277 runs and was made Man of the Series, but Yuvraj Singh, and New Zealanders Stephen Fleming and Lou Vincent also passed 200 runs. On the bowling side, Shane Bond took 11 wickets at an average of just 8.63, despite being rested for one match, and Indian seamers Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar also got more than 10 wickets.|$|E

Maharoof produced {{one of the most}} economical bowling displays in ODI history, conceding nine-rune from ten overs against the West Indies for which he was named Man of the Match. He was reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for excessive appealing in the match as he began celebrating a dismissal before the batsman had been given out by the umpire.|$|E

[...] With that said, in practice, magical weapons are usually specific, consecrated items used within ceremonial magic. There is no hard and fast rule for what is or isn't a magical weapon—if a magician considers it such a weapon, then it is. However, there does exist a set of magical weapons that have particular uses and symbolic meanings.
