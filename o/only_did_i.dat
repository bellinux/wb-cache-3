In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please bear with me, folks.|$|E
500|$|Lemmings {{has also}} been called a {{predecessor}} of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings [...] "was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept," [...] an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said {{that part of the}} inspiration for the first Warcraft game, , was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of The Lost Vikings (which he had worked on) and Lemmings; Fitch said [...] "We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don't we have lots of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other." [...] Lemmings introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: [...] "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clapton's {{commercial}} breakthrough {{came with}} his single, [...] "Girls on the Avenue", issued in January 1975. Although Festival had little {{faith in the}} song—initially releasing it as the B-side of [...] "Travelling Down the Castlereagh"—it {{was picked up by}} radio and became a major hit, reaching the No.4 spot on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart in March. According to Clapton:"Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> not feel that Girls On The Avenue was the perfect song, but Festival Records rejected that song six times. They'd say to me, 'What's the chorus, is it 'Don't you slip' or 'Friday night ...'?' I don't know! Why does a song have to have a hook or a chorus? You either like the song or you don't!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hofmann started drag racing on the East Coast of the United States. He went to Australia {{twice for}} a three-month visit. [...] "Those trips {{were a good}} thing for me," [...] said Hofmann. [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> win a couple of championships, but I got the chance to meet the people from Blower Drive Service from Whittier, California. They thought I had some {{potential}} and backed it up with $100,000 in sponsorship funding." [...] Hofmann added, [...] "That allowed me to hire Tom Anderson as a crew chief, one of the best moves I ever made. It was impossible for me to do both the driving and tuning by myself, and Tom had a lot more experience anyway. We ended up winning a lot of races together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Douglas was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for the role, with his costar Anthony Quinn winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Paul Gauguin, van Gogh's friend. Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: [...] "He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness." [...] Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a painful experience: [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> look like Van Gogh, I was the same age {{he was when he}} committed suicide." [...] His wife said he often remained in character in his personal life: [...] "When he was doing Lust for Life, he came home in that red beard of Van Gogh's, wearing those big boots, stomping around the house — it was frightening." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} you this, my father, though it has not {{to do with my}} story, because then, and then <b>only,</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> ever see Chaka show mercy to one whom he had doomed to die.|$|E
60|$|But not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> congratulate myself upon {{salvation}} {{from the}} past, but upon the prospect for the future. For storms happening so seldom in these seas, one just blown over {{is almost a}} sure guarantee of very many weeks' calm weather to come.|$|E

De Ville drew his {{handkerchief}} from his pocket, made as though to mop the sweat from his face with it (it was a hot day), and at the same time walked past Wallace's back.

6000|$|... "Ye'll be forsworn, then," [...] put in her ladyship sourly. [...] "For I can {{witness to}} the letter that you bore.

60|$|I {{liked to}} be out in the night, with the {{darkness}} close down to the earth, and the feeling of a limitless open all around. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> listen for Steele's soft step, but for any sound--the yelp of coyote or mourn of wolf, the creak of wind in the dead brush, the distant clatter of hoofs, a woman's singing voice faint from the town.|$|E

Well, sir, I can assure you that not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> not know why <b>I</b> <b>do</b> these things, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not even know <b>I</b> <b>did</b> them.

60|$|There was no {{resisting}} such an appeal.

60|$|The {{remainder}} {{of the day was}} spent in active work around the widow's place. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> labor all the afternoon, but far into the evening as well, to show that I did not intend to shirk my duty even though I was going away.

6000|$|... "In a word," [...] said Madame Defarge, {{coming out}} of her short abstraction, [...] "I cannot trust my husband in this matter.

60|$|There is {{no denying}} that I did stand within the doorway to listen, for not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> not wish to {{encounter}} Bullock, but it seemed quite justifiable to ascertain whether the current whispers of his dealings with the poor were true; indeed, {{there was no time}} to move before he replied with a volley of such abuse, as I never heard before or since, at her impudence in making such a demand.|$|E
60|$|Lop-Ear was disgusted and angry. He abused the hyena, {{and then}} went off alone through the trees. I had no reason that I knew for wanting to carry the puppy to the cave, except that I WANTED to; and I stayed by my task. I made the work a great deal easier by elaborating on Lop-Ear's idea. Not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> tie the puppy's legs, but I thrust a stick through his jaws and tied them {{together}} securely.|$|E
