5|$|Hemmings {{conducted}} a study that surveyed 102 progressive heads—broadly defined—of infant, elementary, and secondary schools about Neill's influence. Their responses indicated that Neill had significant impact on how the profession perceived teacher–pupil relations. The respondents also reported significant influence from Neill <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> and sex education. Contrarily, Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E

5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craioveşti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius <b>on</b> <b>moral,</b> political, and military questions.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E
5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book {{one of the}} most {{exciting}} and challenging in the field of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to the issue <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E

5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started {{to believe in the}} merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar and Toleti {{began their}} career as writers in Telugu cinema {{and worked as}} writers for a few films. After writing three scenes for Jayanth C. Paranjee Bavagaru Bagunnara?

Due to lack of earnings, Sukumar briefly continued to teach students, earned money, and returned to film industry. Sukumar later assisted Jayam Raja father Mohan for Kshemanga Velli Labanga Randi (2000), and Hanuman Junction (2001). Before making his directorial debut, Sukumar worked under V. V. Vinayak for Dil (2003) as an assistant director.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

5|$|The asylum was {{established}} by Edward Long Fox and considered {{state of the art}} when it opened in 1806, having been built <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> treatment ideas pioneered at the York Retreat, which had opened in 1796. Fox had an extensive private practice in Bristol and served as a physician at Bristol Infirmary before taking over a madhouse at Cleeve Hill in 1792. He had a range of different businesses locally and was able to pay £4,000 for the Brislington Estate. The site had previously been Brislington Common, which had been enclosed in 1780. The site, on the main road between Bristol and Bath, now the A4, enabled him to attract wealthy clients from both cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Old School and New School factions {{merged with the}} slavery controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The Old School, however, {{was convinced that the}} General Assembly and the larger church should not legislate <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> issues that were not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the Old School faction.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Jableh, al-Qassam {{commenced}} a program of Islamic revival based <b>on</b> <b>moral</b> reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular salaah (prayer) and the sawm (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam's campaign highly influenced Jableh's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major violations. In some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of. Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al-Azhar and among Syrian notables, al-Qassam's loyalties most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as {{his relationship with the}} authorities would indicate. He was well-regarded among much of Jableh's population where he gained a reputation for piety, simple manners and good humor.|$|E
