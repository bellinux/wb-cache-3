25|$|Pure {{sucralose}} {{is sold in}} bulk, but not in quantities {{suitable for}} individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose–water blends are available online. These concentrates contain one part sucralose for each two parts water. A quarter teaspoon of concentrate substitutes for <b>one</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> sugar. Pure, dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable. Most products containing sucralose add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume and texture of an equivalent amount of sugar.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, the {{disaccharide}} sugar {{component of}} all milk, must be cleaved {{in the small}} intestine by the enzyme lactase, in order for its constituents, galactose and glucose, to be absorbed. Lactose intolerance is {{a condition in which}} people have symptoms due to not enough of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. These may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Severity depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. Those affected are usually able to drink at least <b>one</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E

25|$|Daily {{consumption}} of black tea (but not green tea) {{has been associated}} with a significant reduction in death from all cancers. There is limited evidence to suggest that green tea consumption may be associated with a slightly lower risk of esophageal cancer in the Chinese population, a lower risk of lung cancer in women, and a lower risk of oral cancer in Asian people. A 2015 meta-analysis of nine prospective cohort studies concluded that a high amount of green tea consumption may be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in Asian women. This association was not seen in Asian men or when <b>one</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> green tea was consumed daily. Similarly, another analysis of observational data conducted in 2012 suggested that green tea consumption may have a favorable effect on lung cancer risk. The observed effect was strongest in those who consumed more than seven cups of green tea daily. A 2011 meta-analysis of epidemiological studies found limited evidence that green tea consumption may be associated with a moderately reduced risk of liver cancer in Chinese and Japanese people. Limited evidence suggests that green tea consumption is not associated with the risk of developing pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer. The link between green tea consumption and stomach cancer risk is unclear due to inconsistent evidence.|$|E

In a 2015 meta-analysis of such observational studies, an increase in <b>one</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> green tea per day was correlated with a 5% lower risk of death from cardiovascular causes.

2500|$|The {{caffeine}} {{content of}} a single can of Red Bull is 80mg/250ml (32mg/100ml). This {{is about the same}} as <b>one</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, or slightly less depending on the brewing method. The actual caffeine level in Red Bull can vary depending on country, as some countries have legal restrictions on how much caffeine is allowed in drinks. As is the case with other caffeinated beverages, Red Bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse. Excessive consumption may induce mild to moderate euphoria primarily caused by stimulant properties of caffeine and may also induce agitation, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.|$|E
