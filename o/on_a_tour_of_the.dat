5|$|Fischer, {{eligible}} as U.S. Champion, {{decided against}} {{his participation in}} the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal, taking {{himself out of the}} 1966 World Championship cycle, even after FIDE changed the format of the eight-player Candidates Tournament from a round-robin to a series of knockout matches, which eliminated the possibility of collusion. Instead, Fischer embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States and Canada from February through May, playing a simultaneous exhibition, and giving a lecture in each of more than 40 cities. His 94% winning percentage over more than 2,000 games {{is one of the best}} ever achieved. Fischer declined an invitation to play for the U.S. in the 1964 Olympiad in Tel Aviv.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, Mälzel {{took the}} Turk <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. There were several new {{developments}} in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E

Calderwood was leaving <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WFM locals in Colorado {{to raise funds for}} the Cripple Creek strike, and so appointed Junius J. Johnson, a former U.S. Army officer, to take over strike operations. Johnson immediately established a camp atop Bull Hill, which overlooked the town of Altman. He ordered that fortifications be built, a commissary stocked and the miners be drilled in maneuvers.|$|E

Terry-Thomas finished the war as a sergeant, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946.|$|E
5|$|Barbirolli's {{interest}} in new music waned in post-war years, {{but he and}} the Hallé appeared regularly at the Cheltenham Festival, where he premiered new works of a mostly traditional style by William Alwyn, Richard Arnell, Arthur Benjamin, Peter Racine Fricker, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne, Kenneth Leighton and others. For its hundredth anniversary in 1958 the Hallé commissioned several new works, including Walton's virtuosic divertimento Partita. Increasingly, Barbirolli concentrated on his core repertory of the standard symphonic classics, the works of English composers, and late-romantic music, particularly that of Mahler. In the 1960s he {{made a series of}} international tours with the Philharmonia (Latin America, 1963), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR, 1967) and the Hallé (Latin America and West Indies, 1968). It was a lasting disappointment to him that it never proved possible to take the Hallé <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E

5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped {{over the years to}} form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of these tips collapsed, sending thousands of tons of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disaster site.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} {{concession}} for a route from Oslo to Bodø via Trondheim without subsidies. They {{also stated that}} {{they were willing to}} fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London. The first flight was made on 3 May 1952, with the Heron LN-PSG Per. From 7 to 14 May, the plane went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, visiting several airports. Regular services started on 18 August and a one-way ticket cost NOK95.|$|E
