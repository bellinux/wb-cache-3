Low concentrations of <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> tomato exudate migrated anodically, presumably bound to organic anion (carrier). However, this carrier became saturated at about 2 micromolar <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> exudate, and excess Ni ran cathodically. Most of the <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> cucumber, corn, carrot, and peanut exudate ran anodically, and its migration rate was identical for all exudates. Peanut root sap contained 14 to 735 micromolar Ni. The anodic <b>Ni</b> carriers <b>in</b> root sap and exudate appear identical. The carrier in root sap became saturated near 100 micromolar Ni, as shown by cathodic streaking of Ni exceeding that concentration.

40|$|Phyllanthus balgooyi (Phyllanthaceae), one of > 20 nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator {{plant species}} known in Sabah (Malaysia) {{on the island}} of Borneo, is {{remarkable}} because it contains > 16 wt% <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> its phloem sap, the second highest concentration of <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> any living material in the world (after Pycnandra acuminata (Sapotaceae) from New Caledonia with 25 wt% <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> latex). This study focused on the tissue-level distribution of Ni and other elements in the leaves, petioles and stem of P. balgooyi using nuclear microprobe imaging (micro-PIXE). The results show that in the stems and petioles of P. balgooyi Ni concentrations were very high in the phloem, while in the leaves there was significant enrichment of this element in the major vascular bundles. In the leaves, cobalt (Co) was codistributed with Ni, while the distribution of manganese (Mn) was different. The highest enrichment of calcium (Ca) in the stems was in the periderm, the epidermis and subepidermis of the petiole, and in the palisade mesophyll of the leaf. Preferential accumulation of <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> the vascular tracts suggests that <b>Ni</b> is present <b>in</b> a metabolically active form. The elemental distribution of P. balgooyi differs from those of many other Ni hyperaccumulator plant species from around the world where Ni is preferentially accumulated in leaf epidermal cells...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} a possible utilization in the phytoremediation of metal contaminated substrates, Amaranthus paniculatus L. plants were grown {{for one week}} in Ni-spiked growth solutions at 0, 25, 50, 100, 150 μM NiCl 2 in hydroponics under controlled climate conditions. Results showed a high tolerance to <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> plants exposed to low Ni concentrations. Tolerance decreased as <b>Ni</b> concentration <b>in</b> the growth solutions enhanced. <b>Ni</b> concentrations <b>in</b> plant organs (root, stem and leaves) revealed a trend to increase in parallel with the enhancement of <b>Ni</b> content <b>in</b> the growth solution. The ability to accumulate <b>Ni</b> <b>in</b> plants was also evaluated by calculating the bioconcentration factor (BCF). An inverse relation between BCF and <b>Ni</b> concentrations <b>in</b> the growth solution was evidenced. Ni phytoremoval ability of A. paniculatus plants was particularly appreciable at 25 μM NiCl 2, where more than 65 % of the initial Ni amount was taken up by plants in one week of treatment. The capability of plants to translocate Ni from roots to shoots (stem+leaves) was evaluated by the translocation factor (Tf). Results revealed a low Tf in plants exposed to low Ni concentration, suggesting a tolerance mechanism to protect physiological processes occurring in leaves. Overall, A. paniculatus plants showed a valuable capability to phytodecontaminate Ni-polluted waters, particularly at low Ni concentrations...|$|R

Developmental time from second instar to adult eclosion was shortest for those insects fed live T. <b>ni</b> <b>in</b> the second instar with water containing antibiotics and longest for those insects that were able to visualize but not contact their prey. Additionally, the highest level and rate of mortality was recorded with insects that were able to visualize but not contact live prey.  In contrast, immature survival to the 4 th instar was highest for insects fed coddled T. <b>ni</b> <b>in</b> containers pre-exposed to live T. <b>ni,</b> <b>in</b> both groups with and without antibiotics. Adult survival was highest for insects fed live T. <b>ni</b> <b>in</b> the second instar with antibiotics and was lowest for those insects that were able to visualize but not contact live prey.   Highest female to male ratio of 1. 16 was achieved by the insects fed coddled T. <b>ni</b> <b>in</b> containers pre-exposed to live T. ni.   Overall, the best combination of food and antibiotics was obtained with insects fed live T. <b>ni</b> <b>in</b> the second instar and water containing antibiotics. These results support the concept that live prey may provide micronutrients not available in coddled larvae, and that antibiotics in the alimentary canal are advantageous to the development and survival P. bioculatus under these rearing conditions.   Further tests include fecundity, adult longevity, micronutrient determination in live versus coddled T. ni and the analysis of bacteria in the alimentary canal under different rearing regimes. 1.
