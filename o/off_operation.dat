5|$|Given {{the high}} numbers of UN {{casualties}} and under pressure from Clark, Van Fleet broke <b>off</b> <b>Operation</b> Showdown on November 28, thus ending the Battle of Triangle Hill. A few days later, the PVA 34th Division and the ROK 9th Infantry Division {{were engaged in a}} seesaw battle on Sniper Ridge on December 2 and 3 but it failed to produce any territorial gains for either side. On December 15, with the PVA 29th Division taking over the control of the battlefield from the 34th Division, the 12th Corps withdrew from the area and the 15th Corps settled back to the status quo prior to October 14.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Vittorio Veneto were {{completed}} {{in time for}} her to join Littorio on attacks on the convoys Vigorous and Harpoon, which had departed Alexandria and Gibraltar to reinforce Malta simultaneously in mid-June. Combat was limited to the opposing light forces, and Littorio and Vittorio Veneto did not see action; the British nevertheless broke <b>off</b> <b>Operation</b> Vigorous due to the ships' presence and heavy air attacks. While returning to port, Littorio was hit by a bomb from an American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber; the bomb struck the forward gun turret, though it did minimal damage. Before returning to port, a British Wellington bomber torpedoed the ship. The torpedo struck her starboard bow, though she returned to port. Repairs {{were completed}} and on 12 December, both ships were moved from Taranto to La Spezia in response to the Allied landings in North Africa. Roma joined the fleet shortly after the attacks on the two convoys, and joined her sisters for the move to La Spezia. There, she replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship.|$|E
5|$|The VRS {{attacked}} {{at least}} seven more times over the next thirty days, with pauses of two to seven days between each attack. Some lasted for several days, and during each attack UN observers counted from 2,000 to 5,000 explosions. The most successful attack occurred on 14–15 May, when the VRS nearly reached Vidovice on the southern bank of the Sava River. On that occasion, a combined armour and infantry assault broke through three lines of trenches, {{with the assistance of}} strong artillery support including the bombardment of HVO positions with approximately 5,000 shells and two 9K52 Luna-M rockets. In the fierce combat to gain control of Vidovice, the VRS was pushed back by the 4th Guards Brigade and the 106th Home Guard Regiment to its start positions. According to Bosnian Serb sources, the HV fired six rockets from its positions in the Posavski Podgajci and Rajevo Selo areas against targets in Brčko, causing substantial damage but no casualties. Even though the fighting continued, including skirmishes between the VRS and the ARBiH in the area south of Orašje, its overall intensity had declined by 15 May. On 4–10 June, the HV and the HVO launched Operation Leap 2 against VRS-held positions west of Livno. Even though the operation was not directly linked to the Battle of Orašje, its planners thought that it might force the VRS to redeploy a portion of its forces in the Orašje area to shore up its positions near the Livanjsko field. By 10 June, the VRS had called <b>off</b> <b>Operation</b> Flame-95 and the Battle of Orašje effectively ended.|$|E

5000|$|HEVT {{is using}} a 4-cylinder, 2.4L E85-capable engine from a Chevrolet HHR to power a 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission from a Saturn Vue Green Line. This engine powers the front axle and acts as a range extender for the extended-range electric vehicle. The [...] "VT-REX" [...] vehicle has about a 45-mile all-electric range using a custom A123 Systems battery to power a Siemens electric traction drive capable of about 80 kW of power. Since HEVT will have a large electric range with engine <b>off</b> <b>operation,</b> the air conditioning compressor will work off of high voltage and a DC-DC converter will create about 13.8 V from the high voltage bus to power the 12V accessory loads.|$|E
50|$|After a few days, the German advance {{began to}} falter, as the {{infantry}} became exhausted {{and it became}} increasingly difficult to move artillery and supplies forward to support them. Fresh British and Australian units were moved to the vital rail centre of Amiens and the defence began to stiffen. After fruitless attempts to capture Amiens, Ludendorff called <b>off</b> <b>Operation</b> Michael on 5 April. By {{the standards of the}} time, there had been a substantial advance. It was, however, of little value; a Pyrrhic Victory in terms of the casualties suffered by the crack troops, as the vital positions of Amiens and Arras remained in Allied hands. The newly-won territory was difficult to traverse, as much of it consisted of the shell-torn wilderness left by the 1916 Battle of the Somme, and would later be difficult to defend against Allied counter-attacks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—AlGaN/GaN HEMTs {{with a thin}} InGaN {{cap layer}} have been {{proposed}} to implement the normally off HEMTs. The key idea is to employ the polarization-induced field in the InGaN cap layer, by which the conduction band is raised, {{which leads to the}} normally <b>off</b> <b>operation.</b> The fabricated HEMT with an In 0. 2 Ga 0. 8 N cap layer with a thickness of 5 nm showed normally <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> with a threshold voltage of 0. 4 V and a maximum transconductance of 85 mS/mm for the device with a 1. 9 -µm-long gate. By etching off the In 0. 2 Ga 0. 8 N cap layer at the access region using gate electrode as an etching mask, the maximum transconductance has increased from 85 to 130 mS/mm due to a reduction of the parasitic source resistance.

30|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} {{operating}} principle of a single-phase sine wave PV {{system with a}} partial sine wave tracking PWM boost converter has been presented and verified by experiment. During {{the operation of the}} full-bridge inverter, the bypass diode of the first stage power conversion helped in switching <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> of the boost converter. Therefore, the simultaneous switching of first and second power conversion stages was avoided and the power conversion efficiency was increased.|$|E

30|$|We {{put forward}} an energy saving train-scheduling multi-objective {{optimization}} model, which minimizes the energy cost and exhausts emission and total trip time {{by considering the}} locomotive assignment and segment emission constraints. The fuzzy multi-objective optimization approach is employed to get the non-dominated timetable which has equal satisfaction degree for passenger-time and cost. Finally, a numerical example was presented and compared {{to demonstrate that the}} proposed model can reduce the energy consumption significantly compared with the existing models and trade <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> cost against trip time.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the trigate GaN high {{electron}} mobility transistor (HEMT) body geometry on the device RF performance is investigated by 3 -D numerical simulations. The trigate concept is a viable approach to achieve normally <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> and to suppress short-channel effects. The effect of gate length scaling on the RF behavior is studied and guidelines for design improvements are provided. Furthermore, it is shown that trigate HEMTs with improved body design and/or InAlN barriers causing a higher polarization charge than AlGaN can exhibit better RF figures of merit than planar GaN HEMTs...|$|E
40|$|DOE- 2 (DOE 2 90) {{includes}} several correlation curves that predict the energy use of systems underpart load conditions. DOE- 2 simulates systems on an hour-by-hour basis, so the correlations {{are intended to}} predict part load energy use (and efficiency) {{as a function of}} the part load ratio (PLR) for each hour, where PLR = Hourly Load/Available Capacity. Generally residential and small commercial HVAC equipment meets the load at off-design conditions by cycling on and off. Therefore, the part load correlations must predict the degradation due to this on and <b>off</b> <b>operation</b> over an hourly interval...|$|E
