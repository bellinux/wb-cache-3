Armitt had been Chief Executive of Network Rail {{at the time of}} the Grayrigg derailment, and the family <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the accident criticised the award, which coincidentally was conferred on the same day that Network Rail were prosecuted for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Keyes' {{supporters}} {{formed a}} new third party, America's Independent Party, for his presidential candidacy. America's Independent Party gained the affiliation of a faction of California's American Independent Party. However, the AIP ticket, which had Brian Rohrbough, father <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the Columbine High School massacre, of Colorado as its vice presidential candidate, was {{only on the}} ballot in California, Colorado, and Florida.|$|E
5|$|The named {{plaintiff}} in the case, Deborah Peterson, is the sister <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> of the Beirut barracks bombings; joined by victims and other relatives of victims, {{she had won}} a default judgment in 2003 against Iran for {{its role in the}} bombings. Because of the large number of plaintiffs in the case—almost 1,000—the judge appointed special masters to determine each plaintiff's right to collect damages and appropriate amount of damages; in 2007, the judge entered a default judgment against Iran for $2,656,944,877 in damages.|$|E

50|$|The measure {{continues}} the current provision of section 43 that prevents <b>a</b> recovery <b>of</b> money damages for violation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim's</b> rights, {{and the current}} provision that prevents <b>an</b> assertion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim's</b> rights from invalidating an accusatory instrument, conviction or adjudication, or from terminating any criminal or juvenile delinquency case at any point after the case begins. The measure also provides that no claim for a right established in section 43 shall suspend a criminal or juvenile delinquency case if suspension would violate <b>a</b> right <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defendant or alleged youth offender guaranteed by the Oregon Constitution or United States Constitution.|$|R

5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> {{who lost his}} own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency {{in return for a}} payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{isotopes}} {{of sodium}} are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is {{created in the}} carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star {{of at least three}} solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; the neutron radiation dosage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} {{testimony}} {{on the form}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> impact statement was admissible and constitutional in death penalty cases, thus expressly overruling two prior cases, Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E

25|$|Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case {{which held}} that {{testimony}} in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> impact statement is admissible during the sentencing phase of a trial and, in death penalty cases, does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Payne narrowed two of the Courts' precedents: Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
25|$|Crawford, and the {{decisions}} following it, also radically changed {{the handling of}} domestic violence cases by curtailing evidence-based prosecution, a common practice allowing the accused to be prosecuted without the participation of their accusers in the criminal court process. Evidence-based prosecution relies heavily on admission of statements under hearsay exceptions to reproduce the evidentiary effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> testifying in court. The Crawford Court's decision renders most of these statements inadmissible without the accuser coming to court and testifying against the person {{he or she is}} accusing.|$|E
50|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} arsenious oxide, simple arsenic, in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele.

25|$|To this day, {{the exact}} number of victims remains unknown. The {{official}} death toll in August 1928 was 385, but the remains of victims continued to be discovered every few years until the mid-1950s. Many victims were swept out to sea when the flood reached the Pacific Ocean and were never recovered, while others were washed ashore, some as far south as the Mexican border. The remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> were found deep underground near Newhall in 1992, and other bodies, believed to be victims of the disaster, were found in the late 1970s and 1994. The current death toll is estimated to be a maximum of 431 victims.|$|E
25|$|Corruption within One-Two-GO Airlines and the Thai Department of Civil Aviation was {{a factor}} for crash investigators. A {{television}} crew initially learned of fraudulent work rosters for the captain and first officer, obfuscating their illegal work schedule, had been provided to the crash investigators. The lead Thai Department of Civil Aviation investigator reported documents he had received from One-Two-GO were fiction. The National Transportation Safety Board report included the true work rosters, obtained by the family <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim.</b> The NTSB report documents check ride fraud among four other One-Two-GO pilots {{in the months following}} the crash. Legal filings and press articles reference an email among executives of One-Two-GO Airlines, including CEO Udom Tantiprasongchai.|$|E

25|$|Health {{organizations}} and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines rape {{as a form}} of sexual assault, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of sexual violence. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity {{that may or may not}} include rape, including drug-facilitated sexual assault, acts in which a victim is made to penetrate a perpetrator or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon).|$|E
25|$|A 2013 study {{examined}} adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being {{negatively associated with}} resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills {{as a form of}} intervention. Emotional intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress and as mentioned previously, the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>victim</b> going on to perpetuate aggression. One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one’s own emotions. Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.|$|E
