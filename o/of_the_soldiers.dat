5|$|The Red Army {{military}} base in Žirmūnai was abandoned in 1992, {{a few years after}} Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union; a grace period was granted in order to ensure the orderly resettlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> and their families.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> after two and {{one-half}} hours' deliberation. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{were found guilty}} of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he worked}} as a {{district}} officer in the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea, where he {{died at the age of}} 40, probably of complications from his war wounds. He was buried on Garua Island, New Britain.

5|$|Based on {{the concept}} of {{liberating}} the spirits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> and civilians who were sacrificed during the Japanese invasion in World War II, the temple of Poh Ern Shih was constructed {{on the site of the}} bloodshed on Chwee Chian Hill. It was established in 1954 as a modest single storey temple by philanthropist Lee Choon Seng (1888—1966), as one of the few Chinese Mahayana temples in Singapore dedicated to the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.|$|E
5|$|During her lifetime, Maria, {{too young}} to become a Red Cross nurse like her elder sisters during World War I, was patroness of a {{hospital}} and instead visited wounded soldiers. Throughout her lifetime she was noted for her interest in the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers.</b> The flirtatious Maria {{had a number of}} innocent crushes on the young men she met, beginning in early childhood. She hoped to marry and have a large family.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{identity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldier</b> {{responsible for}} <b>the</b> bayoneting <b>of</b> Crazy Horse is also debatable.

To this day, the identification remains questionable.|$|R

5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{gained control}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> his next move, {{according}} to Tacitus, was executing {{the leaders of}} the mutiny.

The dead were not given posthumous Canadian Volunteer Service Medals as they never reached the Korean theatre; Tom Boutillier, a survivor of the crash, considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded.|$|E

5|$|In March 1919, Princess Matoika and Rijndam raced {{each other}} from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a {{friendly}} competition that received national press coverage in the United States. Rijndam, the slower ship, was just able to edge out the Princess—and cut two days from her previous fastest crossing time—by appealing to the honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the 133rd Field Artillery (returning home aboard the former Holland America liner) and employing them as extra stokers for her boilers.|$|E
5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and discipline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered {{in a fashion}} that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts {{go out to the}} families of the fallen soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Major General Auguste Gilliaert {{arrived from}} the Congo {{before the end of}} the month.

The plans for taking Mogi were to be abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Saïo and all but 50 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> besieging it were redeployed.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> of {{the task}} force were {{teenagers}} with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training. Only one third of the officers in the task force had combat experience from World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience. Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force. The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C-rations.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors {{surrounded}} Fort Presque Isle (on {{the site}} of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After holding out for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, {{on the condition that}} they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> after they came out of the fort.|$|E

Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> had not slept for two nights, but the successful crossing was a morale booster, a tonic as he described it.|$|E
