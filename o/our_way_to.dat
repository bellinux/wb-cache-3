5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E

2500|$|Before reciting kiddush, the challah, {{which will}} be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes {{precedence}} to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with kiddush, the challah is covered to [...] "remove" [...] it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during kiddush). Some interpret the covering of the challah allegorically, explaining that if we are supposed to go out of <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> protect even an inanimate object (the bread) from being [...] "insulted" [...] (by the blessing over wine taking precedence), then certainly we must go out of <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> display sensitivity toward the feelings of other people.|$|E

Lisa Power, head of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said [...] "in some ways the storyline was not reflective {{of what was happening}} at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community". She also said [...] "he was perhaps killed off too early as advancements in drugs are helping people live for much longer... Saying that, one decent soap episode is worth a thousand leaflets in schools. That is why we would always go out of <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> help scriptwriters.

2500|$|Wall first {{suggests}} [...] "embedded markets", {{embedded in}} society, with [...] "state provision decentralised", {{as a first}} step to adapt capitalism. He cites the example of the Indian adivasis, who regained the land they originally inhabited and sold tea via the Fair trade system. Here, Wall argues that [...] "social preference rather than profit maximisation socialised economic activity". He welcomes the movements in Argentina that have seen workers occupy and reopen bankrupt factories. He applauds the work done on creating a [...] "decentralised, socialist economy" [...] in Cuba and Venezuela. Wall is encouraged by the growth in Green consumerism, noting that [...] "we cannot shop or work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> utopia, but such projects ease present ills and point roughly to a different future".|$|E

2500|$|On the {{edition of}} 27 October 2006 of Real Time with Bill Maher, he {{described}} conservatives and Republicans {{who refused to}} admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as [...] "cowards." [...] On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: [...] "After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of al Qaeda and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into thinking we could simply fight <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> victory against Islamist terror. I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong." [...] His reversal on the Iraq issue and his increasing attacks on the Bush administration caused a severe backlash from many hawkish conservatives, who accused him of not being a [...] "real" [...] conservative.|$|E
2500|$|Obama {{focused on}} the [...] "{{delegate}} math." [...] He won the total delegate count in Texas, and he stayed close to Clinton on the delegate count in Ohio. [...] "No matter what happens tonight," [...] he said, [...] "we have nearly the same delegate lead that we did this morning, and we are on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> winning this nomination." [...] In fact, March 4 was the first election day in which Clinton won more delegates than Obama (though the Florida and Michigan primaries would later be honored by seating half of the states' delegations). After winning contests in Wyoming and Mississippi the following week, Obama erased Clinton's March 4 gains. On March 15, he increased his lead by 10 delegates at the Iowa county conventions, when former supporters of withdrawn candidates switched their support to him.|$|E

He said one night, as we were sitting in a Chinese inn upon <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Shansi, [...] "I presume there are many in the United States who regard me as little better than a thief and a robber." [...] I tried to assure him that no missionary was more honored than he, none more absolutely trusted, as it had been proven that the charges had no foundation in fact.

[...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me glad to know that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, and I am going to tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. He never even mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E
2500|$|By 1911 it {{was clear}} that the {{development}} of aircraft had reached the point where they were of military significance. [...] France, the world leader in aviation at the time, had over 200 aircraft in military service. In contrast, Britain’s total military aircraft strength was nineteen aircraft, of which, in the words of Colonel J.E.B Seely, Under-Secretary of State for War, [...] "one is broken beyond repair and one is quite out of date. Others are more or less under repair" [...] adding [...] "We are arriving at a point when we think we see <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> choose what is the best type, first for teaching people to fly, and secondly, to buy for the purposes of war should war unfortunately break out". The only practical step that had been taken by the War Office was the creation of an establishment for the scientific examination of the various problems involved in aircraft design. [...] After some consultation with the Royal Aero Club and various aircraft manufacturers, they announced their [...] "Specification for a Military Aeroplane" [...] in late December, the details being published in Flight magazine on 23 December 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell's {{letter to}} the {{president}} was his first major political act of protest, {{but it would not}} be his last. During the mid to late 1960s, Lowell actively opposed the Vietnam War. In response to American air raids in Vietnam in 1965, Lowell rejected an invitation to the White House Festival of the Arts from President Lyndon Johnson in a letter that he subsequently published in The New York Times, stating, [...] "We are in danger of imperceptibly becoming an explosive and suddenly chauvinistic nation, and may even be drifting on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the last nuclear ruin." [...] Ian Hamilton notes that [...] "throughout , [...] was in demand as a speaker and petition signer [...] He was vehemently opposed to the war, but equivocal about being identified too closely with the 'peace movement': there were many views he did not share with the more fiery of the 'peaceniks' and it was not in his nature to join movements that he had no wish to lead." [...] However, Lowell did participate in the October 1967 March on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. against the war {{and was one of the}} featured speakers at the event. Norman Mailer, who was also a featured speaker at the rally, introduced Lowell to the crowd of protesters.|$|E

2500|$|A {{hatred of}} war, he argued in 1936, [...] "can be {{no reason for}} being false to ourselves, {{in the name of}} an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none." [...] And in 1937: [...] "We have not kept {{agreements}} we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I was trembling when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound. Lucas put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition.|$|E
2500|$|Blake {{was given}} {{command of the}} gunboat [...] {{stationed}} in the James River, engaged in transporting troops and in occasional engagements with the enemy. The {{most important of these}} was on 24 January 1865, when a powerful Confederate squadron launched an attack on the Union blockade of the river at Trent's Reach. Sailing downriver the Confederate force drove away the Union pickets, and commenced removing the boom and obstructions. William A. Parker, the Union naval commander, instead protecting the defences, retired and allowed them to be removed, leaving a clear passage for the enemy. However, two rams went aground, and the Confederates had to wait until high water the following night before proceeding. On the morning of the 25th, Parker was relieved of his command and Blake was made temporary commander of the naval division. Blake ordered the monitor [...] to put herself into a position within the range of enemy batteries, such that, if sunk, she would take the place of the removed obstructions. Subsequent attacks by Union ships and shore batteries sank two and badly damaged six of the Confederate ships, who eventually withdrew. After dark a party from Eutaw, commanded by Acting-Ensign Thomas Morgan boarded the abandoned [...] and re-floated her, finding her not as damaged as believed. In a letter Admiral David Dixon Porter wrote to Blake, [...] "Had your predecessor done as well, we should now be in possession of the entire rebel navy, and on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Richmond." [...] Blake continued to command the ironclads and naval picket line until the fall of Richmond and end of the war in April 1865. He was then {{was in charge of the}} removal of the torpedoes and obstructions from the James River.|$|E
