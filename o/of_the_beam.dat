40|$|Abstract- Experimental {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on corroded reinforced High Performance Concrete (HPC) beams of size 150 mm X 250 mm X 3000 mm under both static and cyclic loading, separately under four point bending. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were provided with 10 %corroded steel and some with 25 %. Corrosion of reinforcement was induced by immersing <b>the</b> RC <b>beams</b> in NaCl solution and by electrical conductivity and monitored with the corrosion analyser. <b>The</b> trend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> load-deflection relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> {{was similar to that}} in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> normal reinforced concrete beams under static loading.

Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> by air in the vacuum chamber.

Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire.

All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were tested under static loading to investigate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> pre-release cracks on concrete strains, flexural crack initiation and re-opening loads, overall beam stiffness, and ultimate flexural capacity. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were subjected to cyclic testing to evaluate possible effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-release cracks on the strand stress ranges and fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> field observations, the pre-release cracks in <b>the</b> test <b>beams</b> did not close completely under <b>the</b> <b>beam's</b> weight and pre-stressing force. The pre-release cracks were found to cause changes in <b>beam</b> strains around <b>the</b> crack locations. <b>The</b> overall stiffnesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were also affected by the reduction in <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> inertia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-release crack section.

5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
