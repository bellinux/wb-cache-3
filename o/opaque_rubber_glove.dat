5000|$|A <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> is a glove {{made out}} of <b>rubber.</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>gloves</b> can be {{unsupported}} (rubber only) or supported (rubber coating of textile glove). Its primary purpose is protection of the hands while performing tasks involving chemicals. <b>Rubber</b> <b>gloves</b> can be worn during dishwashing to protect the hands from detergent and allow the use of hotter water. Sometimes caregivers will use <b>rubber</b> <b>gloves</b> during the diaper changing process to prevent contact with the child's fecal material/urine. Health professionals use medical <b>gloves</b> rather than <b>rubber</b> <b>gloves</b> when performing surgical operations.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRubber glove product Thailand {{shows the}} trend of higher growth. Currently, the average export value of <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> product is 826. 72 US$/year. Thus, the {{development}} guideline of this product for Thailand should be concerned. However, <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> process caused the environmental and human impacts. Hence, the eco-efficiency concept of <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> product was interested. Initial important step of eco-efficiency concept was indicator development. Therefore, this research developed the eco efficiency indicators including economic and environmental indicators of <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> product based on the eco-efficiency theory and material flow analysis. The result showed that economic indicators consisted of quantity product and net sale and environmental indicators consisted of material consumption, energy consumption, water consumption, wastewater production, solid waste production, greenhouse gas emission, were selected to eco-efficiency indicators based on eco-efficiency theory and material flow analysis. These eco-efficiency indicators would help to discover more economic and effective ways to improve productivity process and to enhance recyclability or reducing energy and material intensity...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> {{packing machine}} had been {{designed}} an important function which worked with folding carton. Each folded paper carton would be pulled to be erected by vacuum cups. Some carton could not completely form because of an unsuitable design of the erector. Cartons were collapsed or buckling while pulled by vacuum cups that cause to sudden stop the packing process and affect to number and cost of <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> production. This research aimed to use simulation method to erect the folded carton. Finite element (FE) model of the <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> carton was created with shell elements. The orthotropic material properties were employed to specify FE model for analysis erection behavior of the folding carton. Vacuum cups number, positions and rotation points were simulated until obtained a good situation of the folding carton erector. Subsequently, finite element analysis results {{will be used to}} fabricate erector of the <b>rubber</b> <b>glove</b> packing machine in a further work...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} and causes of hand eczema among healthcare workers in Sweden are lacking. Multidrug-resistant bacteria have necessitated improved hand hygiene and preventive measures. This {{has led to an}} increase in the use of disposable <b>rubber</b> <b>gloves</b> and hand disinfectants, which might influence the risk of hand eczema. Our aims were to identify healthcare workers with hand eczema; to estimate quantitative and qualitative exposure to <b>rubber</b> <b>gloves,</b> hand disinfectants and other exposures; and to survey constitutional factors. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to all employees at the hospitals in southern Sweden. The results were statistically analysed using χ 2 -tests and binary logistic regression. The 1 -year prevalence of self-reported hand eczema was 20 % among the responding 9051 nurses and physicians. On a daily basis, 30 % reported hand washing > 20 times at work, 45 % reported using hand disinfectants > 50 times, and 28 % used > 20 pairs of nonsterile <b>rubber</b> <b>gloves.</b> The prevalence of hand eczema was significantly higher among the employees reporting a higher exposure to hand washing, hand disinfectants and <b>rubber</b> <b>gloves</b> than in those reporting a lower exposure. The prevalence of hand eczema was also significantly higher among respondents with a history of childhood eczema, who were smokers, who had a body mass index > 30 kgm- 2, who spent > 30 min per day working in the kitchen or who had children age...|$|R
