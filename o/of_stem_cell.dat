40|$|Substantial {{progress}} has been made in the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for liver fibrosis. However, the therapeutic effect is limited by decreased self-renewal <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> during migration. Therefore, to improve the self-renewal <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> after transplantation is urgent and essential for the successful application <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in clinical practice. Current studies have shown that sex hormones have an impact on the self-renewal <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The effects <b>of</b> estrogens and androgens on the self-renewal <b>of</b> various <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and the functional differences between the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from persons <b>of</b> different sexes are reviewed. Moreover, the effect of sex hormones on <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for liver fibrosis is discussed. It is considered that sex hormones have significant theoretical and clinical values for improving the self-renewal <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and selecting appropriate <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for liver fibrosis...|$|R

Clinical applications <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis will increase in the coming years, and although great care will need to be taken when moving forward with prospective treatments, the application <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> is highly promising...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} types <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> under {{consideration}} for therapeutic purposes.

25|$|The use {{of human}} stem cells, {{particularly}} embryonic stem cells, is controversial. Opponents' objections generally {{are based on}} interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed {{in a variety of}} contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.|$|E

40|$|Homing <b>of</b> {{peripheral}} <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{is regulated}} {{by one of}} the most representative homing factors, stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF- 1 α), which specifically binds to the plasma membrane receptor CXCR 4 <b>of</b> mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (MSCs) in order to initiate the signaling pathways that lead to directional migration and homing <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> This complex homing process and directional migration <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have been mimicked on a microfluidic device that is capable of generating a chemokine gradient within the collagen matrix and embedding endothelial cell (EC) monolayers to mimic blood vessels. On the microfluidic device, <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> showed directional migration toward the higher concentration of SDF- 1 α, whereas treatment with the CXCR 4 antagonist AMD 3100 caused loss <b>of</b> directionality <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, inhibition <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell's</b> main migratory signaling pathways, Rho-ROCK and Rac pathways, caused blockage of actomyosin and lamellipodia formation, decreasing the migration distance but maintaining directionality. <b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> homing regulated by SDF- 1 α caused directional migration <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> while the migratory ability was affected by the activation of migration-related signaling pathways...|$|R

25|$|Cells {{produced}} with SCNT, or iPSCs could eventually {{be used in}} stem cell therapy, or to create organs {{to be used in}} transplantation, known as regenerative medicine. Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. Bone marrow transplantation is a widely used form <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy. No other forms <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy are in clinical use at this time. Research is underway to potentially use stem cell therapy to treat heart disease, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. Regenerative medicine is not in clinical practice, but is heavily researched for its potential uses. This type of medicine would allow for autologous transplantation, thus removing the risk of organ transplant rejection by the recipient. For instance, a person with liver disease could potentially have a new liver grown using their same genetic material and transplanted to remove the damaged liver. In current research, human pluripotent stem cells have been promised as a reliable source for generating human neurons, showing the potential for regenerative medicine in brain and neural injuries.|$|E

Bush. Smith is one of 19 Senate Republicans who voted for the measure.|$|E
25|$|These {{are just}} some {{examples}} of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application {{in the field of}} neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over-proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing research will further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} optical imaging system and {{mathematical}} algorithms for three-dimensional sensing and identification <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Data acquisition <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{is based on}} holographic microscopy in the Fresnel domain by illuminating the cells with a laser. In this technique, the holograms <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are optically recorded with an image sensor array interfaced with a computer and three-dimensional images <b>of</b> the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are reconstructed from the Gabor-filtered digital holograms. The Gabor wavelet transformation for feature extraction of the digital hologram is performed to improve the process of identification. The inverse Fresnel transformation of the Gabor-filtered digital hologram is performed to reconstruct the multi-scale three-dimensional images <b>of</b> the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> at different depths along the longitudinal direction. For recognition and classification <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> a statistical approach using an empirical cumulative density function is introduced. The experiments indicate that the proposed system can be potentially useful for recognizing and classifying <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report on using three-dimensional holographic microscopy for automated identification <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> interstitial <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{along the}} Hydra body column was determined using a simplified cloning assay. The assay measures <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> as clone-forming units (CFU) in aggregates of nitrogen mustard inactivated Hydra tissue. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the gastric region was uniform at about 0. 02 CFU/epithelial cell. In both the hypostome and basal disk the concentration was 20 -fold lower. A {{decrease in the}} ratio <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to committed nerve and nematocyte precursors was correlated with the decrease in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> concentration in both hypostome and basal disk. The ratio <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to committed precursors is a sensitive indicator of the rate of self-renewal in the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> population. From the ratio it can be estimated that <lo % <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> self-renew in the hypostome and basal disk compared to 60 % in the gastric region. Thus, the results provide {{an explanation for the}} observed depletion <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in these regions. The results also suggest that differentiation and self-renewal compete for the same <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> population...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{interactions}} with their niche {{have been well}} documented; however, the influences <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> on one another are rarely addressed.

25|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways are complex, involving {{many different}} elements, and therefore have many targets for misregulation. Mutations that cause constitutive {{activation of the}} Wnt signaling pathway lead to tumor formation and cancer. Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway can lead to increase cell proliferation. Current research {{is focused on the}} action of the Wnt signaling pathway the regulation <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> choice to proliferate and self renew. This action of Wnt signaling in the possible control and maintenance of stem cells, may provide a possible treatment in cancers exhibiting aberrant Wnt signaling.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} are {{commonly}} cultured in vitro as so called neurospheres – floating heterogeneous aggregates of cells, containing {{a large proportion of}} stem cells. They can be propagated for extended periods of time and differentiated into both neuronal and glia cells, and therefore behave as stem cells. However, some recent studies suggest that this behaviour is induced by the culture conditions in progenitor cells, the progeny <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> division that normally undergo a strictly limited number of replication cycles in vivo. Furthermore, neurosphere-derived cells do not behave as stem cells when transplanted back into the brain.|$|E
25|$|Olfactory {{adult stem}} cells have been {{successfully}} harvested from the human olfactory mucosa cells, which {{are found in the}} lining of the nose and are involved in the sense of smell. If they are given the right chemical environment these cells have the same ability as embryonic stem cells to develop into many different cell types. Olfactory stem cells hold the potential for therapeutic applications and, in contrast to neural stem cells, can be harvested with ease without harm to the patient. This means they can be easily obtained from all individuals, including older patients who might be most in need <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapies.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{progress}} in medicine, we are nowadays still faced with diseases and injuries, where with the knowledge, drugs and support technology available to us, we cannot {{achieve the desired}} quality of patient’s life. Progress in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> biology may be the hope for certain diseases in the future. The {{purpose of this article}} is to present a rapidly advancing field <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> We summarize the properties <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> various types <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> according to their origin from the embryonic or adult tissues, and according to their differentiation potential. Although numerous factors that determine the properties <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are currently already known, we still need to know more about their mutual impact. We present the fields of clinical medicine where <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are already used for treatment, as well as those, for which there is, a justified hope that <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy will become part of routine treatment in the near future. The greatest potential <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> is probably their use in the treatment of degenerative diseases and traumatic injuries, where we expect a major impact on the patient’s quality of life. Similarly, the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> has also contributed to understanding cancer diseases and thus open up opportunities for new approach to treating these diseases...|$|R
25|$|Advanced {{stem cell}} {{research}} takes place in Israel. The first steps in the development <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> studies occurred in Israel, with {{research in this field}} dating back to studies of bone marrow stem cells in the early 1960s. By 2006, Israeli scientists were leaders on a per capita basis in the number of articles published in scientific journals related to {{stem cell research}}. In 2011, Israeli scientist Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun led a team which produced the first stem cells from endangered species, a breakthrough that could save animals in danger of extinction. In 2012, Israel was one of the world leaders in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita.|$|E
25|$|Tissue-specific {{stem cells}} produce {{differentiated}} cells {{through a series}} of increasingly more committed progenitor intermediates. In hematopoiesis (blood cell formation), the process begins with long-term hematopoietic stem cells that self-renew and also produce progeny cells that upon further replication go {{through a series of}} stages leading to differentiated cells without self-renewal capacity. In mice, deficiencies in DNA repair appear to limit the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate and self-renew with age. Sharpless and Depinho reviewed evidence that hematopoietic stem cells, as well as stem cells in other tissues, undergo intrinsic aging. They speculated that stem cells grow old, in part, as a result of DNA damage. DNA damage may trigger signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that contribute to depletion <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> stocks. This has been observed in several cases of accelerated aging and may occur in normal aging too.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. Cancer cells must {{be capable of}} continuous proliferation and self-renewal to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain {{the growth of a}} tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, if most tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If they are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from disregulation of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> plasticity). Confounding this debate is the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a Phenotypic plasticity under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, the {{application}} <b>of</b> nanotechnology in <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{research and development}} have made great progress.

30|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{differentiation}} {{is closely}} associated with their microenvironment. The regulation <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> depend largely on their interaction with a highly specialized microenvironment or niches [86]. Secreted factors, <b>stem</b> cell–neighboring <b>cell</b> interactions, extracellular matrix (ECM), and mechanical properties collectively make up the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> microenvironment. The niche secretes appropriate chemicals to direct the differentiation and development <b>of</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> For example, Adams et al.
