5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated {{in the construction of}} Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E

After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author Peter S. Beagle was called in for a rewrite. According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.|$|E

Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school.
