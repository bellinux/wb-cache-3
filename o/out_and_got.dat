500|$|Holloway {{highlighted}} Michael's {{review of}} Angela, wherein {{he tells her}} [...] "You're adequate", as the best line in the episode. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the quotes for the episode. The site ranked Angela's monologue about how much she loves being judged, as well as Jim's revelation that Dwight thinks a Thursday is really a Friday, a four out of five. TV Fanatic awarded the conversation between Stanley and Michael—wherein Stanley tells Michael how to properly listen for subtext in a voicemail—as well as Dwight's frustration that he went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> drunk with his laser tag team, a five out of five.

I did {{something}} I virtually never do, as I said much earlier: I went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> drunk.

2500|$|Wolford’s agent, Ralph Cindrich, {{later said}} that at least four other teams {{had been willing to}} match the Colts’ offer. [...] What had set the Colts apart from the other bidders was a clause they agreed to insert into Wolford’s new contract. [...] It {{guaranteed}} that Will Wolford, left tackle, would remain the highest paid player on the Colts’ offense {{for as long as he}} played on it. [...] Better paid than the Colts’ running backs, the Colts’ wide receivers, or any of the other acknowledged stars. [...] Even if the Colts went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> themselves the NFL’s most expensive quarterback, Wolford’s salary would rise to eclipse his, too. [...] “I thought linemen would get a little more money from free agency,” said Wolford later. [...] “But I didn’t think that would happen. [...] I was numb.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard; seasons 3–8) is Monk's {{second and}} final assistant.

A young widow who lives with her daughter Julie, Natalie lost her husband Mitch {{when he was shot}} down over Kosovo in 1998. She first appears in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring" [...] (3.10). Natalie was introduced partway through season three when Bitty Schram, who played Sharona, left [...] "precipitous", reportedly over a contract dispute. Traylor Howard had not yet seen the show and was unenthusiastic about her manager's urgings to audition as Schram's replacement. She nevertheless tried <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> the part. Despite her initial [...] "cool" [...] reception from fans, show co-creator Andy Breckman believes Traylor quickly and successfully filled the void. [...] "I will always be grateful to Traylor because she came in when the show was in crisis and saved our baby [...] We had to make a hurried replacement, and not every show survives that. I was scared to death." ...|$|E
