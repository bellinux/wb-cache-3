5|$|When Magnum XL-200 opened, it used pads {{similar to}} those still in use on Gemini. Shortly after its debut, however, these up-stop plates were {{replaced}} with more traditional up-stop wheels that keep the train from flying <b>off</b> <b>its</b> rails.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting <b>off</b> <b>its</b> center.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and <b>off</b> <b>its</b> northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Mongol wings closed around the {{shattered}} Rus' army, cutting <b>off</b> <b>its</b> retreat.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of March 2004, 20 percent of the 306 units in The St. James had been leased. Construction was completed later that month, with finishing touches added later in the year. In March 2005, {{a year after the}} building was completed, P Associates and Clark Realty Capital, under the name of 700 Walnut LP, announced The St. James was for sale. At the time, 45 percent of its units were being rented. P Associates sold <b>off</b> <b>its</b> interest in the building that same year.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{in which}} Portugal {{remained}} neutral, hundreds of Jewish refugees came to Caldas da Rainha to escape Nazism. Caldas {{also served as}} home to British and American airmen who landed or crashed in Portugal or <b>off</b> <b>its</b> coast. In January 1943, 230 Britons resident in Axis power Italy were evacuated to Caldas, where {{they were expected to}} stay {{until the end of the}} war. Most of these evacuees were over 65 years of age and had resided in Italy for a long time.|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting <b>off</b> <b>its</b> fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
5|$|Four to fivefoot (1.2 to 1.5m) waves hit {{the eastern}} portion of Calvert County, causing {{a home to}} be knocked <b>off</b> <b>its</b> {{foundation}} in North Beach.

5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, {{although it is not}} possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly <b>off</b> <b>its</b> orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Diệm {{recalled}} him to Saigon to help {{deal with}} the Hòa Hảo, a religious sect equipped with a private army. The Hòa Hảo was effectively an autonomous entity in the Mekong Delta, as its private army enforced a parallel administration and refused to integrate into the Saigon administration. While the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) General Dương Văn Minh led the military effort against the Hòa Hảo, Thơ helped to weaken the sect by buying <b>off</b> <b>its</b> warlords.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, PepsiCo spun <b>off</b> <b>its</b> {{restaurants}} division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which {{changed its}} name to Yum! Brands in 2002. Yum has proved a more focused owner than Pepsi, and although KFC's number of outlets have declined in the US, the company has continued to grow in Asia, South America and Africa. The chain has expanded to 18,875 outlets across 118 countries and territories, with 4,563 outlets in China alone, KFC's largest market.|$|E
