500|$|The first verse {{reflects}} Harrison and Prabhupada's {{discussion that}} day – although {{the reference to}} political leaders [...] "acting like big girls" [...] {{is an example of}} Harrison reverting to [...] "Scouse parlance", according to author Alan Clayson. The latter also notes the antipathy that Harrison felt towards politicians following the Bangladesh aid project, when the American and British governments continued to withhold funds intended for the millions of starving Bangladeshi refugees. The lyric centres on maya, or the illusory nature of human existence, as Harrison sings of humankind behaving as if [...] "we own this whole world", oblivious to the consequences and the end that awaits the individual in this life. Allison summarises the message to mean: [...] "karma is the law of our existence; substituting ego for God is our problem; we must prepare <b>ourselves</b> <b>for</b> death." ...|$|E
500|$|One of her major {{initiatives}} as First Lady was {{the promotion}} of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems {{at the local level}} through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers. She stated, [...] "Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of <b>ourselves</b> <b>for</b> the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others." [...] She undertook a [...] "Vest Pockets for Volunteerism" [...] trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs. Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady's scheduling, noted that Pat [...] "saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be". Her second volunteerism tour—she traveled [...] within the United States—helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the Vietnam War. She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League, and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations. Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy.|$|E
500|$|The pike {{and shot}} {{infantry}} had {{by this time}} adopted {{a system in which}} arquebusiers and pikemen were intermingled in combined units; both the French and the Imperial infantry contained men with firearms interspersed in the larger columns of pikemen. This combination of pikes and small arms made close-quarters fighting extremely bloody. The mixed infantry was normally placed in separate clusters, with the arquebusiers on the flanks of a central column of pikemen; at Ceresole, however, the French infantry had been arranged with the first rank of pikemen followed immediately by a rank of arquebusiers, who were ordered to hold their fire until the two columns met. Montluc, who claimed to have devised the scheme, wrote that: In this way we should kill all their captains in the front rank. [...] But we found that they were as ingenious as <b>ourselves,</b> <b>for</b> behind their first line of pikes they had put pistoleers. Neither side fired till we were touching—and then there was a wholesale slaughter: every shot told: the whole front rank on each side went down. The Swiss, seeing the French engage one of the two columns of landsknechte, finally descended to meet the other, which had been slowly moving up the hillside. Both masses of infantry remained locked in a push of pike until the squadron of heavy cavalry under Boutières charged into the landsknechts' flank, shattering their formation and driving them down the slope. The Imperial heavy cavalry, which had been on the landsknechts' right, and which had been ordered by d'Avalos to attack the Swiss, recoiled from the pikes and fled to the rear, leaving Carlo Gonzaga to be taken prisoner.|$|E

2500|$|His first {{objection}} {{is that we}} have {{no experience}} of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created <b>ourselves.</b> <b>For</b> example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made and compare it to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues that we have no experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way [...] that a watch has.|$|E

James Montgomery of MTV commented that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] showed a [...] "definite change of pace for Perry. While it's still as saccharine sweet as her previous hits, there's also a rather, well, mature quality to it (despite the title)." [...] Amos Barshad of New York said, [...] "Right now, it's feeling a bit too earnest, and not nearly as catchy as the follow-up single from Perry's first album ('Hot n Cold,' most definitely still a jam). That said, we are now mentally preparing <b>ourselves</b> <b>for</b> its ubiquity."

Mulally went on to state that [...] "The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford" [...] and that Ford Motor Company's supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that [...] "In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company" [...] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.|$|E
