5|$|Operation Tungsten was a Second World War Royal Navy {{air raid}} that {{targeted}} the German battleship Tirpitz.

50|$|Via {{a series}} of T-dualities one obtains the result that in any type II {{superstring}} theory, when an NS5-brane and a Dp-brane cross one necessarily creates <b>or</b> <b>destroys</b> a D(p-2)-brane. Lifting this statement to M-theory one finds that when two M5-branes cross, one creates <b>or</b> <b>destroys</b> an M2-brane. Using S-duality one may obtain transitions without NS5-brane. For example, when a D5-brane and a D3-cross one creates <b>or</b> <b>destroys</b> a fundamental string.|$|R

5|$|There was {{significant}} rivalry for frequencies among Pirate stations, fuelled {{by the financial}} rewards that came from promoting raves, and as a consequence, {{it was not uncommon}} for some stations to attack <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> the transmitters and/or studios of their rivals for airtime.|$|E
5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans {{are vulnerable to}} disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.|$|E

5|$|September 17, 2004– Former Hurricane Ivan tracks {{along the}} border between North Carolina and Tennessee, {{dropping}} heavy rainfall that peaks at 17.0inches (432mm) in Cruso, as well as producing 4tornadoes in the state. The hurricane kills eight people in the state, and causes severe flooding just nine days after the previous cyclone tracked through the area; the flooding damage <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> hundreds of buildings, and washes away several bridges.|$|E

5|$|September 23, 1975- Hurricane Eloise makes {{landfall}} near Destin with {{winds of}} about 125mph (200km/h), producing light precipitation across the peninsula with heavier amounts near the landfall location peaking at 14.9inches (378mm) at Eglin Air Force Base. Hurricane-force winds and storm surge {{of up to}} 16feet (4.9m) across the panhandle destroy 500 small businesses and damage <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> 8,000houses. Damage in the state totals $100million (1975USD, $400million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The City furthered {{its plan}} of {{renewing}} {{the area and}} took no heed of the PAC. In response, the PAC secretly submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places for the Milwaukee Avenue district. It was approved on May 2, 1974 by Secretary of the Interior Rogers CB Morton. This meant that the City could not alter <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> the houses using federal funds without a public hearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may also lead to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> local sub-populations.|$|E

5|$|As the {{fortress}} expands and develops, new noble positions become available. While regular dwarves {{will be happy}} with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and , getting negative thoughts {{if they are not}} fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E
5|$|August 13, 2004– Hurricane Charley makes {{landfall}} on Cayo Costa with {{winds of}} 150mph (240km/h) and hours later hits the mainland {{portion of the}} state at Punta Gorda, becoming the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The winds damage <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> thousands of homes, knock down {{tens of thousands of}} trees, and leave more than 2million Floridians without power. Charley results in eightdirect fatalities, 20indirect casualties, and 792reported injuries. Throughout the state, damage is estimated at $13.5billion (2004USD, $17.5billion 2017USD), at the time the second costliest hurricane in United States history; it has since dropped to sixth.|$|E

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
5|$|In outline, the XV Mountain Corps {{plan was}} for a heavy aerial {{bombardment}} of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body.|$|E
5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), <b>or</b> <b>destroy</b> agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} integrated pest management.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — At present, {{intelligent}} {{planning in}} the Graphplan framework is {{a focus of}} artificial intelligence. While the Creating <b>or</b> <b>Destroying</b> Objects Planning (CDOP) is one unsolved problem of this field, one of the difficulties, too. In this paper, we study this planning problem and bring forward the idea of transforming objects to propositions, based on which we offer an algorithm, Creating <b>or</b> <b>Destroying</b> Objects in the Graphplan framework (CDOGP). Compared to Graphplan, the new algorithm can solve not only the entire problems that Graphplan do, but {{also a part of}} CDOP. It is {{for the first time that}} we introduce the idea of object-proposition, and we emphasize the discussion on the representations of creating <b>or</b> <b>destroying</b> objects operator and an algorithm in the Graphplan framework. In addition, we analyze the complexity of this algorithm. Keywords—Graphplan, object_proposition, Creating <b>or</b> <b>destroying</b> objects, CDOGP...|$|R
