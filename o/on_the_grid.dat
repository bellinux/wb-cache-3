5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid,</b> not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E

5|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), in dry and sunny weather. At the start of the race, J.J. Lehto stalled his Benetton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> Pedro Lamy, starting from further back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid,</b> had his view of the stationary Benetton blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the startline causing minor injuries to nine people. Further back, Martin Brundle had a good start, overtaking two cars as well as Lehto, propelling him from thirteenth to tenth place.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} round in Australia, an error in {{qualifying}} left him in 10th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> {{for the start of}} the race. On the second lap of the race, Webber crashed with Heikki Kovalainen, Adrian Sutil and Nick Heidfeld following their efforts to avoid a collision with Rubens Barrichello, causing all except Barrichello to pit.|$|E
40|$|The species {{composition}} and abundance of fishes trapped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grids</b> covering <b>the</b> drainage outlets in the Durban harbour graving dock were investigated over a 12 month period. Fifty-three {{species of fish}} and several invertebrates, including the crabs Scyllaserrata and Portunus pelagicus, prawns Penaeus spp. and crayfish Palinurus spp., were caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grids.</b> Shoaling fishes of the families Clupeidae and Mugilidae were numerically dominant with Haemulidae, Sparidae and Monodactylidae other major components. The economic value of the captured fishes to dockyard workers and possible mechanisms to reduce catches are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} solution-adaptive grid generation {{technique is}} presented. The adaptation technique redistributes grid {{points to improve}} the accuracy of a flow solution without increasing <b>the</b> number of <b>grid</b> points. It is applicable to structured grids with a multiblock topology. The method uses a numerical mapping and potential theory to modify <b>the</b> initial <b>grid</b> distribution based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> properties of <b>the</b> flow solution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>grid.</b> <b>The</b> technique is demonstrated with two examples - a transonic finite wing and a supersonic blunt fin. The advantages are shown by comparing flow solutions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adapted <b>grids</b> with those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>grids...</b>|$|R
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battle arena, with {{characters}} and enemies moving according to their position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> Four commands are available to the party: Attack (fight enemies), Contact (talk with an enemy), Analyze (check an enemy for its strength and weaknesses), and Form (rearrange the party <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid).</b> The character's main means of attack is their Persona, beings summoned into battle to cast a spell that can heal the party, and inflict physical or elemental damage on an enemy. Each Persona has access to up to eight skills, and each character can change their Persona during their turn. Personas earn experience points independent of the characters they are assigned to, and gain new abilities through extended use. Experience is awarded based on how often the player uses certain characters or Personas. Alongside their Personas, each character is able to attack with an equipped melee weapon or firearm, use an item, or attempt {{to talk with the}} demons that act as the game's standard enemies.|$|E
5|$|Different {{parts of}} each unit can be damaged, {{and the success}} of each attack depends on the units' stats as well as maneuvers. Several ground units are also present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> map, and can only be {{destroyed}} by bombers. The level of fuel and amount of ammunition of each unit are limited and must be replenished when necessary.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rain}} that had fallen, the drivers went out on track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the fastest time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> to Button, who had set the fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed {{the line at the}} end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed to jump from ninth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> to finish in fifth place, just ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who climbed from eleventh <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the fastest}} time in Q2 at 1:06.228, the fastest time set in any {{session at the}} Red Bull Ring. However, both Ferrari and Red Bull set their fastest times in Q2 on the supersoft tyres, unlike Mercedes, who used the ultrasoft compound, meaning that both teams were able to start the race on the harder tyre. Realizing this, Mercedes tried to counter the move and sent their cars back out on supersoft tyres, but were unable to improve on their times due to rain {{starting}} to fall. Jenson Button moved into Q3, while his teammate Fernando Alonso did not, ending up 14th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> In 12th place, Wehrlein equalled Manor's highest ever qualifying result, being between the two Haas drivers Esteban Gutiérrez and Romain Grosjean <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> Following their problems in Q1, Pérez and Sainz were unable to set a time and were thus eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{were the}} only team to use the medium tyre in the first {{qualifying}} session (Q1), with all other teams using the faster soft tyre. Five drivers were eliminated in Q1, four of them being the two Marussia and McLaren cars, all of which had yet failed to go through to Q2. They were joined by the Force India of Nico Hülkenberg, who was to start 16th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) estimation via phase {{information of}} sparse solution {{is presented in}} this paper. Unlike the conventional sparse source localization approach using the amplitude of sparse solutions only, through a special partition of the receiving data of the sensors, the phase information of the available sparse solutions is also extracted to estimate DOAs.

5|$|The {{second session}} saw the Mercedes drivers doing only one timed run, which proved {{sufficient}} to proceed, while the Red Bull and Toro Rosso cars were split up, with Daniil Kvyat and rookie Max Verstappen failing {{to make it}} through. Also eliminated were both Force India drivers and the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr, though in a respectable eleventh place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{third part}} of {{qualifying}} determined pole position {{and only the}} two Mercedes drivers set two timed laps. After he clocked in behind both Ferrari drivers in his first run, Rosberg improved to second place on his second time out, {{but was unable to}} challenge teammate Hamilton, who took the fiftieth pole position of his career. Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen locked out the second row <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> Therefore, Q3 saw little running with the final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} Alonso's second {{consecutive}} win; he started from 15th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> {{to win the}} Singapore Grand Prix two weeks prior. Kubica held off a determined attack from Räikkönen in the closing laps to take second place. Massa's seventh place narrowed his gap to Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship to five points.

5|$|Webber's two {{following}} {{races in}} Malaysia and Australia were cut short due to mechanical problems. In Malaysia, Webber started 4th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> {{and was still}} running in that position before a hydraulics failure ended his race on lap 14. In his home race, Webber qualified seventh and was leading the race before his gearbox failed on lap 22. Webber had taken {{the lead of the}} race on lap 21, becoming the first Australian to lead the Australian Grand Prix since John Bowe had done so in the early laps of the non-championship 1984 Australian Grand Prix. A sixth-place finish in San Marino saw Webber move up to 9th in the Championship. In the , hydraulics failure struck again ending his race after he had fought his way back to 12th from his 19th place start <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> due to a mid-weekend engine change.|$|E

Commemorative stickers on helmets and cars were other tributes at that race. Race winner, Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, dedicated his maiden Hungarian win to Bianchi and his family, acknowledging that the Frenchman would have been part of the team in future. Daniil Kvyat too dedicated his maiden podium finish as did third-placed finisher, Daniel Ricciardo.|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E

30|$|Multigrid methods rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{interplay of}} a {{smoothing}} algorithm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fine <b>grid</b> {{and a general}} solver <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coarse <b>grid.</b> To obtain good convergence characteristics, <b>the</b> coarse <b>grid</b> algorithm must operate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low-frequency part of the approximation error. At the same time, its influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high frequencies must be minimized. Employing a coarse grid correction that supplies, together with an approximation of the degrees of freedom, an interpolant characterized by a small high-frequency component minimized two potential difficulties that may arise in multigrid-based calculations: it can prevent the emergence of situations in which effects related to the high-frequency component of the deformation obstruct <b>the</b> approximation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coarse <b>grid,</b> and it minimizes the risk that changes in the approximation of the high-frequency component induced by <b>the</b> coarse <b>grid</b> correction degrade <b>the</b> convergence characteristics of <b>the</b> algorithm applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fine <b>grid.</b> For {{a discussion of the}} impact of the order of the prolongation function being used to transfer <b>the</b> coarse <b>grid</b> correction to <b>the</b> fine <b>grid,</b> see [19], as well as the literature referred to in that publication.|$|R
