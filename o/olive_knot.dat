40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in studying interspecies bacterial interactions in diseases of animals and plants as {{it is believed that}} the great majority of bacteria found in nature live in complex communities. Plant pathologists have thus far mainly focused on studies involving single species or on their interactions with antagonistic competitors. A bacterial disease used as model to study multispecies interactions is the <b>olive</b> <b>knot</b> disease, caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psv). Knots caused by Psv in branches and other aerial parts of the olive trees are an ideal niche not only for the pathogen but also for many other plant-associated bacterial species, mainly belonging to the genera Pantoea, Pectobacterium, Erwinia and Curtobacterium. The non-pathogenic bacterial species Erwinia toletana, Pantoea agglomerans and Erwinia oleae, which are frequently isolated inside the olive knots, cooperate with Psv in modulating the disease severity. Co-inoculations of these species with Psv result in bigger knots and better bacterial colonization when compared to single inoculations. Moreover, harmless bacteria co-localize with the pathogen inside the knots, indicating the formation of stable bacterial consortia that may facilitate the exchange of quorum sensing signals and metabolites.

Hypertrophy of the stem tissue was concomitant with the formation of bacterial aggre-gates, microcolonies and multilayer biofilms, over the cell surfaces and the interior of plasmolysed cells facing the air-tissue interface of internal opened fissures, and was followed by invasion of the outer layers of the hypertrophied tissue. Patho-genic invasion of the internal lumen of newly formed xylem vessels, which were connected with the stem vascular system, was also observed in late stages of infection. Ultrastructural analysis of knot sections showed the release of outer membrane vesicles from the pathogen surface, a phenomenon not described before for bacterial phytopathogens during host infection.

Results showed that PICF 7 was able to establish and persist in stem tissues upon artificial inoculation. While PICF 7 was not able to suppress disease development, its presence transiently decreased pathogen population size, produced less necrotic tumours, and sharply altered the localization of the pathogen in the hyperplasic tissue, which may pose epidemiological consequences. Confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with fluorescent tagging of bacteria revealed that when PICF 7 was absent the pathogen tended to be localized at the knot surface. However, presence of the BCA seemed to confine P. savastanoi at inner regions of the tumours.

Pathogenicity tests in which these two bacteria were co-inoculated on the stems of 1 -year-old olive plants at ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 100 and 100 : 1 showed that the growth of P. agglomerans was apparently aided {{by the presence of}} an actively growing population of Ps. savastanoi. At the same time, however, a dominant population of P. agglomerans at the inoculation site tended to depress the growth of Ps. savastanoi, probably because of competition for space and nutrients between these bacteria and by means of antibiotic production by P. agglomerans. In some cases the association of P. agglomerans, which in culture was found to produce indole- 3 -acetic acid but not cytokinins, with Ps. savastanoi resulted in an increase in the size of knots.

40|$|Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335 causes <b>olive</b> <b>knot</b> {{disease and}} is a model {{pathogen}} for exploring bacterial infection of woody hosts. The type III secretion system (T 3 SS) effector repertoire of this strain includes 31 effector candidates plus two novel candidates identified in this study which have not been reported to translocate into plant cells. In this work, we demonstrate the delivery of seven NCPPB 3335 effectors into Nicotiana tabacum leaves, including three proteins from two novel families of the P. syringae complex effector super-repertoire (HopBK and HopBL), one of which comprises two proteins (HopBL 1 and HopBL 2) that harbor a SUMO protease domain. When delivered by P. fluorescens heterologously expressing a P. syringae T 3 SS, all seven effectors were found to suppress the production of defense-associated reactive oxygen species. Moreover, six of these effectors, including the truncated versions of HopAA 1 and HopAZ 1 encoded by NCPPB 3335, suppressed callose deposition. The expression of HopAZ 1 and HopBL 1 by functionally effectorless P. syringae pv. tomato DC 3000 D 28 E inhibited the hypersensitive response in tobacco and, additionally, expression of HopBL 2 by this strain significantly increased its competitiveness in N. benthamiana. DNA sequences encoding HopBL 1 and HopBL 2 were uniquely detected {{in a collection of}} 31 P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains and other P. syringae strains isolated from woody hosts, suggesting a relevant role of these two effectors in bacterial interactions with olive and other woody plants...|$|E
40|$|Incluye 4 ficheros de datosPseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi is {{the causal}} agent of olive (Olea europaea) knot disease and an unorthodox {{member of the}} P. syringae complex, causing aerial tumours instead of the foliar necroses and cankers {{characteristic}} of most members of this complex. <b>Olive</b> <b>knot</b> is present wherever olive is grown; although losses are difficult to assess, {{it is assumed that}} <b>olive</b> <b>knot</b> {{is one of the most}} important diseases of the olive crop. The last century has witnessed a good deal of scientific articles describing the biology, epidemiology and control of this pathogen. However, most P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains are highly recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which has effectively left the pathogen out of the scientific progress in molecular biology that has elevated the foliar pathogens of the P. syringae complex to supermodels. A series of studies in the last years have made significant advances in the biology, ecology and genetics of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi, paving the way for the molecular dissection of its interaction with other non-pathogenic bacteria and their woody hosts. The selection of a genetically pliable model strain was soon followed by the development of rapid methods for virulence assessment with micropropagated olive plants and the analysis of cellular interactions with the plant host. The generation of a draft genome of strain NCPPB 3335 and the closed sequence of its three native plasmids has allowed for functional and comparative genomic analyses for the identification of its pathogenicity gene complement. This includes 34 putative type III effector genes and genomic regions, shared with other pathogens of woody hosts, that encode metabolic pathways associated with the degradation of lignin-derived compounds. Now, the time is right to explore the molecular basis of the P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi-olive interaction and to get insights into why some pathovars like it necrotic and why some like it knot. Synonyms: Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi Taxonomy: Kingdom Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas; included in genomospecies 2 together with at least P. amygdali, P. ficuserectae, P. meliae and 16 other pathovars from the P. syringae complex (aesculi, ciccaronei, dendropanacis, eriobotryae, glycinea, hibisci, mellea, mori, myricae, phaseolicola, photiniae, sesami, tabaci, ulmi, and certain strains of lachrymans and morsprunorum); when a formal proposal is made for the unification of these bacteria, the species name P. amygdali would take priority over P. savastanoi. Microbiological properties: Gram-negative rods, 0. 4 - 0. 8 by 1. 0 - 3. 0 µm, aerobic. Motile by one to four polar flagella, rather slow growing, optimal temperatures for growth of 25 – 30 °C, oxidase negative, arginine dihydrolase negative, elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco, most isolates are fluorescent and levan negative although some isolates are non-fluorescent and levan positive. Host range: P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi causes tumours in cultivated and wild olive and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Although strains from olive were reported to infect oleander (Nerium oleander), this is generally not the case; however, strains of P. savastanoi pv. nerii can infect olive. Pathovars fraxini and nerii differentiate from pv. savastanoi mostly in their host range, and were not formally recognized until 1996. Literature previous to about 1996 generally name strains of the three pathovars as P. syringae subsp. savastanoi or P. savastanoi subsp. savastanoi, contributing to confusion about host range and biological properties. Disease symptoms: Symptoms of infected trees include hyperplastic growths (tumorous galls or knots) on the stems and branches of the host plant and, occasionally, on leaves and fruits. Epidemiology: The pathogen can survive and multiply on aerial plant surfaces, as well as in knots, from where it can be dispersed by rain, wind, insects and human activities, entering the plant through wounds. Populations are very unevenly distributed in the plant, and suffer drastic fluctuations throughout the year, with maximum numbers of bacteria occurring during rainy and warm months. Populations of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi are normally associated to non-pathogenic bacteria, both epiphytically and endophytically, and were demonstrated to form mutualistic consortia with Erwinia toletana and Pantoea agglomerans that could result in increased bacterial populations and disease symptoms. Disease control: Based on preventive measures, mostly sanitary and cultural practices. Integrated control programs benefit from regular applications of copper formulations, which should be maintained at least a few years for maximum benefit. Olive cultivars vary in their susceptibility to <b>olive</b> <b>knot,</b> but there are no known cultivars with full resistance to the pathogen.

40|$|Apresentação efectuada no XIV Congresso da Sociedade Portuguesa de Bioquímica, Vilamoura, Portugal, 2004 The {{bacteria}} Pseudomonas savastanoi is {{a natural}} pathogen of Olea europaea L., and {{is responsible for the}} <b>olive</b> <b>knot,</b> a disease that seriously affects productivity of Portuguese olive orchards. In previous work, we established an in vitro elicitation system using the bacteria and suspension cell cultures of O. europaea var. Galega Vulgar, which is known to be resistant to this pathogen. This system is now being used to study the interaction between plant and pathogen and evaluate the Hypersensitive Response triggered by the infection. Evaluation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels was performed by spectrofluorimetric quantification of the fluorescent probe H 2 DCFDA, and showed a significant increase in production by the elicitated cells, with a pattern typical of the Oxidative Burst (OB) of incompatible interactions. The levels of lipid peroxidation followed a similar pattern, indicating ROS production in the OB as an origin of this cellular damage. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity was measured to determine changes in the phenylpropanoid pathway and, therefore, in secondary metabolism. Determination of total lignin content of cell walls allowed us to assess these changes. Challenged cells showed a significant increase in PAL activity during the time course of elicitation, as well as an increase in the lignin content. These results point to changes in the production of secondary metabolites, which are induced by the elicitation with an avirulent pathogen and lead to the reinforcement of the cell wall. The TUNEL assay was performed to evaluate if programmed cell death is triggered in challenged cells. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - Projecto Olea POCTI/AGR/ 36239.

Consequently, the culture of olive trees is of {{considerable}} importance for our country. In order to maintain and improve our varieties, responses to environmental stresses and pests, which can seriously affect productivity, must be studied, and clones more adapted to challenge stress conditions must be found. One problem that seriously affects Portuguese olive orchards' is <b>olive</b> <b>knot,</b> a disease caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi (Pseudomonas syringae pv savastanoi) which, causing tumours in the stems and leaves of the trees, drastically reduces the production of fruits.

With the objective of developing an in vitro system of eliciation of Olea europaea with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas savastanoi, we have initiated suspension cell cultures of from calli of the variety Galega Vulgar. Cells in middle exponential growth phase were incubated with a suspension of P. savastanoi.
