The local upper class donated the statues of the temples to the city, where they were found by the excavations. Many of these works are precisely dated by inscriptions of the donor and provide a good chronological framework. There is also sometimes even the mention of a sculptor's name, such as Aba or Schabaz. In addition to works in the classical Greco-Hellenistic tradition (especially of classical deities) they show the people sitting or standing, facing front and dressed in Parthian fashion with rich regalia. The men wear shoes, pants and a tunic over it. Over the tunic some men wear a kind of jacket. <b>Often</b> <b>you</b> can see {{on the left side}} a dagger, a sword on his right hip. Kings wear a tiara with a diadem or tiara with the image of an eagle. The right hand is usually raised in a gesture of adoration to the top, the left hand holds a sword or a palm branch. Other statues carry in both hands a statue of God. There is striking attention to detail. The patterns of the substances, weapons and jewelry are reproduced exactly.|$|E

Holm explained why he accepted the role, saying, [...] "It's not <b>often</b> <b>you</b> get offered a leading role at age 65...

She asserted that the tour was a [...] "pop-electro opera" [...] because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So <b>often</b> <b>you</b> go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|E

[...] Littlefield praised the episode for dropping the viewer {{into the middle}} of an episode with complex characters and storylines without getting too confusing. People magazine reviewer David Hiltbrand called the episode [...] "extraordinary" [...] and gave it an A grade. He complimented the realism, the hand-held camera work and the cast, particularly Belzer. Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun-Times complimented the cast and praised the show for not depending on car chases or action sequences. Grahnke also said the show [...] "has the spice, dry wit and ethnic diversity of the Hill Street Blues crew, with even more eccentricities and a heightened sense of realism". John Goff of Daily Variety said the episode was well filmed and edited, and included a strong cast with performances [...] "above normal level of series work". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts particularly praised Andre Braugher's performance: [...] "It's not <b>often</b> <b>you</b> actually witness a TV star being born... The moment the galvanic actor steps onto the screen, though, he owns it." [...] The New York Times television critic John J. O'Connor praised the performance of Jon Polito, and said the role could be [...] "the kind of career break Joe Pesci found in the Lethal Weapon movies".|$|E

[...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon.

During rehearsals, the structure of Act Two was re-written. Famously contrary to Chekhov's wishes, Stanislavski's version was, by and large, a tragedy. Chekhov disliked the Stanislavski production intensely, concluding that Stanislavski had [...] "ruined" [...] his play. In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, [...] "Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone...

2500|$|Frederick {{disliked the}} German language, and literature, {{explaining}} that German authors [...] "pile parenthesis upon parenthesis, and <b>often</b> <b>you</b> find {{only at the}} end of an entire page the verb on which depends the meaning of the whole sentence". He discarded many baroque era authors as uncreative pedants and especially despised German theatre. Also, Frederick II was mostly indifferent to the revival of German culture in the later part of his reign, as he was unimpressed by the authors of the [...] "Sturm und Drang" [...] movement and remained of essentially classical taste. His main inspiration were ancient philosophers and poets as well as French authors of the 17th century. It should however be noted that interest in foreign cultures was by no means an exception in Germany at that time. The Habsburg court at Vienna was open to influences from Italy, Spain and France. Many German rulers sought to emulate the success of Louis XIV of France and adopted French tastes and manners, though often adapted to the German cultural context. In the case of Frederick II, it might also have been a reaction to the austerity of the familial environnement in which he grew up, as his father had a deep aversion for France and was not interested in the cultural development of his state.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his initial}} failure as a Test batsman in 1955 Barrington [...] "set out to {{eliminate}} fun from his game {{and replace it}} with something very near impregnability". Ian Chappell wrote with feeling [...] "Every so <b>often</b> <b>you</b> encounter a player whose bat seem about a yard wide. It's not, of course. It just seems that way. England's Ken Barrington was one. Our own Bill Lawry was another. Gee, they were hard to dislodge". This was not always appreciated by the selectors, spectators and the press; and he once met a man on a train who told him [...] "I always switch off the television when you come in". This lack of appreciation may have been affected {{by the fact that he}} scored most of his centuries overseas and that he could play entertaining strokes, but chose not to do so. He was controversially dropped from the England team after 57 Tests for taking over seven hours to make 137 against a weak New Zealand attack in 1965 in which he [...] "almost brought the game to a standstill". But when quick runs were needed in the Fifth Test at Melbourne in 1962–63 he surprised everyone by smashing a hundred off 122 balls and bringing up the century with a six into the stands. Though he rarely expressed open dissent he used to pull faces if he disagreed with an umpire or thought that the light was too bad or the bouncers too frequent. His grimacing and nervous jump when receiving hostile fast bowling led some to believe that he was afraid, but he stood up to Wes Hall, Chester Watson, Charlie Griffith and Peter Pollock even if injured.|$|E
