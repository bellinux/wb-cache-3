40|$|Partially <b>ordered</b> {{transport}} <b>service</b> {{offers a}} middle ground between <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> and unordered service. For applications requiring only partial order rather than total <b>order,</b> partially <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> provides performance improvements in terms of delay and buffer utilization. Intuitively, one expects a partially <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> to provide relatively greater performance improvement when the partial order specified by the service user is more "flexible" (i. e., has fewer order constraints) and smaller performance improvement when the partial order is less "flexible" (i. e., has more order constraints). In this paper, we investigate this notion formally by proposing metrics for the "flexibility" of partial orders, and determining through an OPNET simulation how well these metrics correlate with expected performance. Two metrics are investigated: m(PO), and density. Results show that for fixed system conditions (e. g., fixed buffer size, network loss rate, and round-trip delay,) m(PO) and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytic model for investigating the throughput, delay and buffer utilization characteristics of partially <b>ordered</b> transport <b>services.</b> We analyze {{the effects of}} packet and ack losses as well as applications' order requirements on overall system performance. The analytic model is verified by comparing its results against those of an OPNET simulation model. Analytic results show that for applications that can tolerate some reordering {{in the delivery of}} objects, use of partially <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> instead of <b>ordered</b> <b>service</b> provides important buffer utilization and delay improvements, particularly as the loss rate increases and the order requirements of applications decrease. In terms of throughput, it makes no difference which <b>service</b> (i. e., <b>ordered,</b> partially ordered, unordered) an application uses. Analytic study also shows that by judicious choice of sender's transmission order, overall system performance can further be improved in a partially <b>ordered</b> <b>service.</b> Keyw [...] ...|$|R

It is hardly possible that he should discuss any subject within the publicist's range, without bringing into light some of its less superficial aspects, and adding observations of originality and value to the stock of political thought. To set people thinking at all on the more general and abstract truths of that great subject which is commonly left to be handled lightly, unsystematically, fragmentarily, in obedience to the transitory necessities of the day, by Ministers, members of Parliament, journalists, electors, and the whole host who live intellectually and politically from hand to mouth, is in itself a service of all but the first <b>order.</b> <b>Service</b> of the very first order is not merely to propound objections, but to devise working answers, and this is exactly what Sir Henry Maine abstains from doing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{programming}} {{of applications}} like distributed database systems or distributed simulations {{can often be}} simplified if the programmer can rely on a network <b>service</b> offering certain <b>ordering</b> semantics of messages. There have been numerous suggestions for systems providing such an <b>ordering</b> <b>service</b> over the Internet Protocol (IP), some taking into account NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multiple Access) networks like ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and ISDN. This paper discusses the difference of the services offered by IP and ATM {{and its impact on}} the provision of a reliable <b>ordered</b> multicast <b>service</b> (ROMS). Two different solutions are presented to realize a ROMS on top of ATM: First, an intermediate service adaptation layer according to the IP-over-ATM and the MARS models can be introduced between an <b>ordering</b> <b>service</b> on top and ATM below. Second, a native ATM solution can be designed that takes advantage of the properties of ATM. This approach again can be realized by two different layers (reliable transport <b>service</b> and <b>ordering</b> <b>service),</b> or by an integrated layer. 1...|$|R

The analysis implies that increase of number of household members by one member leads to decrease of monthly number of <b>ordered</b> <b>services</b> by 2 - 3 tasks. On the other hand, increase of grade of care subsidy by one grade leads to increase of monthly number of <b>ordered</b> <b>services</b> by approximately two tasks. Other factors included to the models are not correlated with explained variable at level below alpha = 0, 1.
