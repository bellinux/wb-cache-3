40|$|The {{research}} is {{developed in the}} framework of a constructivist approach to learning. I suggest through the example of learning equations how recent developments in cognitive science could be connected to school learning. I propose a methodology of teaching practice consisting in the following three components: systematic training, focused on building specific skills; randomized training, focused on developing variability across skills; structured training, aiming at assimilating the invariants. This methodology has been applied in experimental classes and the results show an increasing interest of children for mathematics and a high level of creativity in problem solving and composing. The methodology reflects a neurophysiological model inferred for explaining the emergence of learning. Understanding equations: some connections One of the <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> in mathematics, which practically cross the curriculum from grades 1 to 12, is equation. I will use it as a case-concept to exemplify the main ideas of this paper. Understanding the way in which equations work supposes connecting two components: one from the perspective of mathematics and the other from the perspective of building the necessary skills to deal appropriately with the mathematical content. In mathematics, the equations play two specific roles, which connect them to <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>concepts.</b> The first role played by equations is to connect an operation to its inverse. For example, through functional equations, we are passing from addition to subtraction of real numbers and vice versa: Fig. 1 : Generating subtraction through addition and vice versa In an analogous way, functional equations connect multiplication and division: Fig. 2 : Generating division through multiplication and vice versa f(x) = x + a f- 1 (x) = f(x) -...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), {{otherwise}} known as prion disorders, are fatal diseases causing neurodegeneration {{in a wide range}} of mammalian hosts, including humans. The causative agents – prions – are thought to be composed of a rogue isoform of the endogenous prion protein (PrP). Beyond these and <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> <b>concepts,</b> fundamental questions in prion biology remain unanswered, such as the physiological function of PrP, the molecular mechanisms underlying prion pathogenesis, and the origin of prions. To date, the occurrence of TSEs in lower vertebrates like fish and birds has received only limited attention, despite the fact that these animals possess bona fide PrPs. Recent findings, however, have brought fish before the footlights of prion research. Fish models are beginning to provide useful insights into the roles of PrP in health and disease, as well as the potential risk of prion transmission between fish and mammals. Although still in its infancy, the use of fish models in TSE research could significantly improve our basic understanding of prion diseases, and also help anticipate risks to public health.

Therefore, the demand for relevant analysis concerning behaviour of players grows. This thesis aims to study decision making under risk in the environment of gambling and illuminates the discrepancies, provided risk averse consumers are the bettors. The thesis asks the question why {{people are willing to}} participate in games with negative expected value and what is their real motivation for gambling, what phenomena determine their view on betting opportunity and how they cope with theoretical models. The theoretical part focuses on existing models of decision making under risk theory and critically evaluates their ability to plausibly reflect reality.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the level of awareness, knowledge, and understanding of Islamic banking and finance (IBF) among bank customers. However, there has been no study to date of the level of knowledge of IBF among bank managers. This paper aims to do that for bank managers in Malaysia. The findings of the study are vital for future human capital development in the Islamic banking industry. Overall, {{the results of the study}} show that bank managers possess good knowledge of the general principles of IBF and some basic concepts, like murabahah/bay[bi-thaman ajil, qard hasan and ijarah. However, their knowledge of <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> <b>concepts,</b> like musharakah and mudarabah is only of a moderate level. The results also indicate that the bank managers ’ knowledge on advanced concepts of IBF such as ghurmi (risk) and gharar (uncertainty) are relatively poor. The Pearson Correlation test indicates attendance at training programmes as the most significant factor in improving the managers ’ level of knowledge of IBF. The results also indicate that managers with longer banking working experience and higher level of education have inverse relationship with the level of knowledge of IBF. However, while longer working experience in the IBF industry indicated a positive relationship with knowledge of IBF, it was not at a significant level. I...|$|E

Maybe it is even {{the same kind of}} twisted fate that has confined us to a wheelchair in the first place, as none of us was born in it. With different ages, backgrounds, interests and sets of difficulties to master, we committed ourselves to initiate careers in architecture several years ago. Accessibility issues, especially in terms of mobility, have (always) been an intrinsic and fundamental part of our approach to academic projects, and they will most certainly continue to maintain a strong presence in our professional lives. This book reflects a set of principles and motivations that fuel our daily concerns. First and foremost, it is our desire to introduce people {{to a wide range of}} viewpoints, other ways of perceiving the environment in general, and architecture in particular. Furthermore, we aspire to break nonsensical stereotypes, particularly those that claim everything dealing with accessibility and universal design is ugly or sad, or that it only exists to assist a ridiculously small chunk of the population that is (un) fortunately affected by some kind of affliction. In terms of academic training, we’d like to voice our concern that very little is being done to approach architecture through anything other than a pure ocularcentric bias that precludes <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> <b>concepts.</b> If anything, architecture is created by means of and for the entire human body.

50|$|Similar to <b>other</b> <b>basic</b> ideas, the <b>concept</b> of {{organisational}} routines can {{be linked}} to the Carnegie School (Cyert & March, 1963; March & Simon, 1958; Simon, 1947). In this regard, Dewey’s (1922) work construed habits as a form of reflective action and as major driver of individual and collective behaviour. In later years, Stene (1940) described organisational routines as interaction patterns that are pertinent for the coordination of organisational activities and differentiated them from actions that are preceded by decision making. According to Simon, individual’s ideas are boundedly rational and organizations are rational systems wherein coordination and resolution of conflict is necessary. He also contended that organisational routines develop to save time and attention during the analysis and making of decisions. Such routines are combined with performance programs that enable organisations to respond to the changes in the environment. The standard rules and behavioural patterns bring about effective organisational decision-making processes as they reinforce search issues, conflict resolution and environment adaptation.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines Davidson and Heidegger 2 ̆ 7 s rejections {{of correspondence}} truth, {{as well as}} their claims that truth is theoretically primitive. Truth is primitive {{in the sense that it}} cannot be reduced to, nor defined in terms of, some <b>other</b> more theoretically <b>basic</b> <b>concepts,</b> such as those offered in correspondence, coherence, and pragmatic accounts of truth. The fact that truth cannot be defined in terms of more <b>basic</b> <b>concepts</b> does not mean that there are not important and meaningful things to say about truth; Davidson and Heidegger 2 ̆ 7 s agreement that there is more to say about truth distinguishes them from minimalist approaches to truth.

The dissertation claims that the two philosophers agree, despite radically different background texts and methodologies, on the fundamental relationship between self, other, and world. The dissertation moves beyond mere comparison by showing that Davidson 2 ̆ 7 s own position commits him to a Heideggerian treatment of truth, or something like it. I argue that understanding the similarities and supplemental arguments offered by each philosopher leads to a better overall account of truth than that offered by each philosopher individually.
