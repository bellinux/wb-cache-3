5|$|Though {{numerous}} episodes {{are still}} missing, full-length audio soundtracks for all missing episodes {{are held by}} the BBC. These come from <b>off-air</b> recordings made by fans, often made by use of a microphone attached to a tape recorder placed close to the television set. While the quality of these <b>off-air</b> recordings varies greatly, multiple fan recordings exist for every episode.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Who is unusual, however, in {{that each}} of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} <b>off-air</b> by fans at home. Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes exist in full colour, which {{is not always the}} case for other series.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} and scripts {{for the production}} survive, as do some amateur <b>off-air</b> reel-to-reel audio tape recordings of four of Dylan's songs. In 2005 the BBC launched {{a search for a}} video recording of the play, uncovering some audio recordings of the songs, but it seems that a full <b>off-air</b> audio copy does not exist. In April 2007, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about the making of the play in the Arena strand, featuring interviews with Saville, Jones, Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Dylan collector Ian Woodward, and the first re-broadcast of the songs from the play. In November 2008, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a documentary, narrated by Bob Harris, about Dylan's visit to London and the making of the play.|$|E
5|$|Broadcast News: Since May 2010, the British Library {{has been}} making <b>off-air</b> {{recordings}} of daily TV and radio news broadcasts from seventeen channels, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News, Al-Jazeera English, NHK World, CNN, France 24, Bloomberg, Russia Today and China's CCTV News. Many of the programs come with subtitles, which can be electronically searched, greatly enhancing {{the value of the}} collection as a research tool.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the popularity of pirate radio BBC radio was restructured in 1967, establishing BBC Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and Radio 4. A number of DJs of the newly created pop music service BBC Radio 1 came from pirate stations. The UK Government also closed the international waters loophole via the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act of 1967, although Radio Caroline continued to broadcast (with some sizeable <b>off-air</b> periods between 1968 and 1972 and 1980–83) until 1990.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 2012, a coup d'état in Guinea-Bissau {{was staged}} by {{elements}} {{of the armed forces}} about two weeks before the second round of a presidential election between Carlos Gomes Júnior and Kumba Ialá. The coup started in the evening with military personnel and equipment making its way onto the streets, followed by the state-owned media being taken <b>off-air.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unrelated to {{the regular}} archive purges, the final shot of The Deadly Assassin Episode 3 (1976) has been excised from the master copy. The shot was removed after its initial UK transmission, {{following}} complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association. Subsequent repeats and commercial releases have restored the shot from <b>off-air</b> video copies.|$|E
5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Dæmons. <b>Off-air</b> NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} watched by 9.91 million viewers and {{attained}} a 36% audience share. Critical {{reaction to the}} episode from The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw and The Northern Echos Steve Pratt suggested that, at 120 minutes, the plot was overstretched. The Stages Mark Wright compared Smith favourably to her predecessor in the assistant role, Julia Sawalha as Carla Borrego, while both Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy and Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury discussed the nostalgia invoked by the episode, {{as a result of}} the series having been <b>off-air</b> since 2004.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, gunfire {{was heard}} between 19:00 and 21:00, as mutinous troops {{attempted}} {{to overthrow the}} government by seizing control of the centre of the capital Bissau. Initial reports by diplomats in the country said presidential candidate Carlos Gomes Júnior and interim President Raimundo Pereira were missing. The mutineers seized control of the offices of the incumbent African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and radio stations. They also fought police officers loyal to the government, forcing them to retreat after coming under fire from RPGs. The soldiers blocked the roads {{into and out of the}} capital city and the national radio and television was taken <b>off-air</b> at 20:00.|$|E
25|$|Currently only 19 {{complete}} serials survive, {{all from}} reel-to-reel <b>off-air</b> recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also {{the first three}} episodes of a remake of Escape In Time currently exists, eps 1 & 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and ep 3 is from an <b>off-air</b> recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson, {{the rest of this}} serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station WBAI on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station WRGP early Monday mornings.|$|E
25|$|However, in October 2012, DZCE-TV (which {{occupies}} the channel) reopened the analog signal to relaunch as INC TV; therefore, channel 49 can only transmit digitally during <b>off-air</b> {{hours of the}} analog channel 49.|$|E
25|$|Parlophone records made live {{recordings}} {{of both the}} Hat shows, and studio {{recordings of}} a collection of the songs about animals. Unreleased material, privately recorded or <b>off-air,</b> was later released on LP and CD.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} exists in {{pristine}} {{form in the}} BBC archives, the second performance only as a lower-quality <b>off-air</b> recording, which excludes the first five minutes of the programme and both musical interludes, preserving about 18 minutes of material.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 a sixth {{season was}} {{announced}} making the show return after being <b>off-air</b> {{for nearly four}} years. The age limit is again 16-35 and auditions are currently held in Oslo (April 18), Trondheim (May 9), Stavanger (May 16) and Bergen.|$|E
25|$|Excluding {{compilations}} and repeats, this totals 475 episodes. Some early {{episodes of}} the series, including the first, were wiped {{in the late}} 1970s. Following the BBC's Treasure Hunt appeal for missing material in 2002, several shows were recovered from <b>off-air</b> recordings made by listeners.|$|E
25|$|After {{two months}} of being <b>off-air,</b> the first show to air during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike on January 2, 2008 {{featured}} a small musical segment {{at the beginning of}} the show detailing O'Brien's newly grown beard in a show of support for the striking writers. At the beginning of the January 28 episode, it was revealed that Conan had shaved his beard, which was followed with a similar musical segment.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2010, Hinch {{confirmed}} the liver cancer diagnosis, {{and said that}} he expected to undergo surgery to remove a third of his liver, and that this would take him <b>off-air</b> for several weeks. Doctors gave him a 60 per cent chance of surviving a further five years. On 4 November 2010, Hinch told his listeners that his doctors had told him that without a liver transplant, his maximum survival would be 12 months.|$|E
25|$|WTIU {{television}} - a 24-hour {{public television}} licensed to Indiana University, {{operating out of}} the Radio and TV Center on the Bloomington, Indiana campus. WTIU is a PBS affiliate and carries national and locally produced programming, serving over 20 counties in west and south-central Indiana, including the cities of Bloomington, Bedford, Columbus, and Terre Haute, and the communities of Martinsville, Linton, Bloomfield, Nashville, Spencer, and Seymour. Approximately 175,000 TV households {{are included in the}} viewing area, cable and <b>off-air</b> combined.|$|E
25|$|Casualty usually {{runs for}} 50 minutes between 20:0022:00 slot on BBC One. Special {{events such as}} the Eurovision Song Contest and {{sporting}} events sometimes see the schedule moved around. On most of these occasions, Casualty is taken <b>off-air</b> for the night to make way for alternative shows. It has been known in the past that if an episode is in two parts, part one will be aired on the Saturday and part two on Sunday. It is broadcast across Europe via BBC Entertainment on the same date.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{completion}} of the Monday Night Wars in 2001, a rivalry between the then-WWF and its archrival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the WWF emerged victorious, acquiring all assets of WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW; the third largest promotion in the United States at this point in time) through separate buyouts that included the employees (on and <b>off-air</b> talent) from both companies. The sales had left WWF as the sole wrestling promotion in the world with international TV distribution (until the national expansion of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Ring of Honor in 2002).|$|E
25|$|The {{show was}} {{a number of times}} said to have come to its end, only to reappear. For example, in 1984, TV Times {{reported}} that series 5 would be the last. In 1985, it again seemed as if that the current series was the last one, and it was <b>off-air</b> (bar repeats) for three years, to reappear in 1988. This series appeared to be the last as Dennis Waterman announced his departure {{at the end of its}} run. However, after a two-and-a-half-year break, the show was back again for a further two-and-a-half-year run, which ended with the tenth series in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The program's {{pilot was}} tested on several cable {{providers}} to gauge interest and feedback from viewers, {{most notably the}} Hispanic community, including those who are fans of the original Betty, who hoped that ABC would maintain {{the integrity of the}} original. ABC also allowed its affiliates to show free <b>off-air</b> screenings to the public at various events ahead of the show's debut. In addition the network screened the debut episode on the web and made the episodes available for download on iTunes after their initial airings on January 5, 2007. The encore episodes also have run on ABC Family and SOAPnet, both of which have aired marathons of the show.|$|E
25|$|ONdigital had {{problems}} from the start, and renaming the service ITV Digital on 11 July 2001 failed {{to help the}} matter. All subscription services except E4 and FilmFour went <b>off-air</b> on 1 May 2002 after the consortium collapsed, explained as being due to paying {{too much for the}} television rights for The Football League. However, the choice of 64QAM broadcast mode, the fact that at least 40% of homes would need new aerials to receive it, a high churn rate, an insecure hackable encryption system, the cost of having to provide free set-top boxes, and aggressive competition from BSkyB all contributed to ITV Digital's spiraling costs, before shareholders Granada and Carlton called a halt to the venture.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{original}} 625-line PAL colour videotapes, all except Episode Four were wiped for reuse. However, a converted 525-line colour NTSC version recorded <b>off-air</b> from an American broadcast was {{made available to}} the BBC. This version was abridged and unsuitable for transmission as it was not of broadcast standard (the US recordings were made on a domestic Betamax VCR from a repeat in 1978). In 1992 the colour signal from the NTSC tapes was used as the basis for restoring the colour to the 16mm monochrome telerecordings of episodes one, two, three and five. These versions were subsequently repeated on BBC2 on consecutive Fridays in November/December 1992 (20/11/92 to 18/12/92 at 7.15pm). The ratings were 2.52, 2.96, 2.30, 2.19 and 2.34 million viewers respectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, KQED {{inherited}} KNEW-TV (channel 32) from Metromedia, {{but found}} {{they could not}} operate it without losing money. Various PBS and locally produced programs from KQED would air erratically and {{at different times of}} the day on KQEC. In 1988, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoked KQED's license to operate KQEC, citing excessive <b>off-air</b> time, further charging dishonesty in previous filings with regard to the specific reasons. The alleged dishonesty was in reference to KQED's claim of financial woes for keeping KQEC off the air for most of 1972 through 1977, and again for several months in 1979 and 1980. After being revoked from KQED's hands, the reassigned license was granted to the Minority Television Project (MTP), one of the challengers of the KQED/KQEC filing. The KQEC call letters were changed to KMTP-TV under the new license.|$|E
25|$|On the March 1 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Big Show knocked out Roman Reigns of The Shield with the KO Punch after Reigns was shoved into him during {{an attack on}} Randy Orton and Sheamus. After the March 4 episode of Raw went <b>off-air,</b> Show was {{attacked}} by the Shield. Four days later on SmackDown, Show again assisted Sheamus and Orton in warding off The Shield, though he hit Sheamus with a KO Punch and was hit with an RKO by Orton in return. On the March 11 episode of Raw, Show defeated Shield member Seth Rollins via disqualification after the rest of The Shield interfered. Orton and Sheamus were then allowed to pick a third partner to face the Shield in a six-man tag team match at WrestleMania 29 and originally chose Ryback. However, on the March 18 episode of Raw, Ryback was booked in another match at the event, leaving the spot open. Later that night, Big Show saved the two from an attack by The Shield and was immediately recruited as their partner. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Show, Orton and Sheamus were defeated by The Shield, after which, Show knocked out both of his teammates. The following night on Raw, Orton and Sheamus faced off in a match to earn a match with Big Show, however, the match ended in a no contest after Show interfered. Show was then defeated by Orton and Sheamus in two handicap matches, first on the April 12 episode of SmackDown via count-out, and second on the April 15 episode of Raw via pinfall. On the April 19 episode of SmackDown, Show teamed up with old rival Mark Henry to defeat Orton and Sheamus in a tag team match, with Show pinning Orton for the win. The feud between Big Show and Orton led to an Extreme Rules match on May 19 at Extreme Rules, which Show lost. After Extreme Rules, Show took a hiatus from WWE television.|$|E
500|$|On 29 November 2009, he was commentating an ODI between England and South Africa when he {{was heard}} {{swearing}} on air following a catch taken by Paul Collingwood dismissed Ryan McLaren. The BBC released a statement on 30 November which read: [...] "An <b>off-air</b> comment made by Geoffrey Boycott in a live broadcast was heard by some listeners which we apologised for {{as soon as we}} realised it had been audible." ...|$|E
500|$|Nickelodeon {{supported}} the episode with a month-long <b>off-air</b> marketing campaign including print, outdoor and consumer product partner support. Nickelodeon also launched an on-air sweepstakes called [...] "Where's Gary". Every night {{for five days}} leading to the episode's premiere, Patchy the Pirate (a character portrayed {{as the president of}} the SpongeBob SquarePants Fan Club played by Tom Kenny), and other celebrity guests searched in various locations for Gary. By visiting Nick.com, the viewers could receive a [...] "Trail of The Snail" [...] tracking card to enter Patchy's search locations in order to win the sweepstakes. The prize was a trip to the Nickelodeon Animation Studios to meet the production team of the show and to sit in on a voice recording session with the series cast.|$|E
500|$|Canada {{condemned}} the coup; while the United States' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, [...] "We {{call for the}} release of all government leaders and urge all parties to reconcile their differences through the democratic process." [...] The United States' embassy issued a statement that read: [...] "It is regrettable that elements of the Bissau-Guinean military have chosen to derail the democratic process in Guinea-Bissau." [...] At a daily press briefing, the State Department spokesman Mark Toner called on all sides to the conflict to [...] "put down their weapons, release government leaders immediately and restore legitimate civilian leadership," [...] adding that it [...] "appeared the junta had taken control of media outlets, as they were <b>off-air</b> and the headquarters of PAIGC and were trying to restrict movement" [...] and that [...] "we regret that they have chosen to disrupt the democratic process, which already was challenged by the opposition's call to boycott the second round of elections." [...] The State Department also issued a travel warning to the country and called on its citizens already in the country [...] "to shelter in place and avoid the downtown area of Bissau." ...|$|E
500|$|The hotel {{opened with}} {{fireworks}} displays on St. Patrick’s Day 1949. Two thousand Houstonians paid $42 {{a person to}} have dinner at what was widely publicized as “Houston’s biggest party" [...] which cost an estimated one million dollars. The party was attended by over 150 Hollywood celebrities including Ginger Rogers, Hedda Hopper, Robert Preston and Errol Flynn along with noted Los Angeles business executives and reporters, {{some of whom were}} flown in to Houston International Airport on a customized Boeing 307 Stratoliner airplane which McCarthy had bought only days earlier from Howard Hughes. Many more were brought in by train on a chartered Santa Fe Super Chief. With a crowd estimated at 50,000 gathering outside the hotel, newspaper boys dressed in black tie handed out commemorative editions of the Houston Post as guests arrived that evening. The party became very overcrowded, with three thousand people milling in the hotel's public areas, a thousand more than had been foreseen. Houston mayor Oscar F. Holcombe and his wife sat in a hallway for two hours after his chair was stolen. [...] "It was the worst mob scene I have ever witnessed," [...] Holcombe said later. The festivities became so raucous that a radio broadcast from the hotel by actress, singer and World War II pinup girl Dorothy Lamour was cut off by the network; assuming he was <b>off-air,</b> NBC audio engineer Raoul Murphy uttered an expletive heard live nationwide and dead air greeted the audience for a very long twenty seconds. Due to the numerous broadcast difficulties, Lamour reportedly fled the stage in tears.|$|E
500|$|At WrestleMania VIII, Michaels {{defeated}} Tito Santana in {{his first}} pay-per-view singles match after both men had simultaneously eliminated each other from that year's Royal Rumble. Michaels subsequently became a contender to the promotion's singles titles and failed to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from champion Randy Savage {{in his first}} opportunity to compete for that title at British event UK Rampage, held on April 19 at the Sheffield Arena and broadcast on Sky Movies Plus (the match later aired in the US on the edition of June 15 of Prime Time Wrestling). Michaels was also unable to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart in the WWF's first-ever ladder match at a Wrestling Challenge taping on July 21, which would subsequently be made available on multiple Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases. However, he won the title from The British Bulldog on the October 27 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, which aired on November 14. Shortly thereafter, he faced Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the Survivor Series, but lost the match. Originally the secondary main event, Michaels and Hart became the primary main event after The Ultimate Warrior was unable to compete {{and was replaced by}} Mr. Perfect (Cut Hennig) in the tag team match that involved Randy Savage against the team of Ric Flair and Razor Ramon. During this time, Michaels and Sherri split and he engaged himself in a feud with former tag team partner Marty Jannetty. Michaels lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on the May 17, 1993 episode of Raw, but regained it on June 6 {{with the help of his}} debuting [...] "bodyguard" [...] (and <b>off-air</b> friend) Diesel.|$|E
