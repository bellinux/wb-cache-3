5|$|Catherine was the {{daughter}} of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, {{one of the most powerful}} figures amongst Bosnian nobility, Grand Duke of Bosnia and the ruler of Zachlumia and Travunia. His domain later came to be known as Herzegovina, after the German title of herzog he adopted in relation to the Duchy of St. Sava. Catherine's mother was Jelena, daughter of Zeta's lord Balša III and the first of Stjepan's three wives. Catherine was the couple's first child but the precise date <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>birth</b> is not known; both 1424 and late August 1425 have been suggested by her biographers. It can be surmised that the place <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>birth</b> was either the Sokol Fortress, an old seat of the House of Kosača, or the feudal town of Blagaj, Stjepan's favourite residence.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>birth,</b> Louise's {{father was not}} yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as Duke until 1794), and {{consequently}} she was not born in a court, but rather in a less formal home. Charles was field marshal of the household brigade in Hanover, and soon after Louise's birth he was made Governor-General of that territory by his brother-in-law George III, king of the United Kingdom and Hanover (husband of his sister, Queen Charlotte). The family subsequently moved to Leineschloss, the residence of Hanoverian kings, though during the summer they usually lived at Herrenhausen.|$|E

5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to the uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>birth</b> and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E
