5|$|The park's {{land was}} once home to Native Americans, {{followed}} by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially {{a result of}} the efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E
5|$|Thrum's Hawaiian Almanac and Annual for 1883 {{reported}} Kalākaua's tour expense {{appropriated by}} the government as $22,500, although his personal correspondence indicates he exceeded that early on, and exact tallies of the trip are not known. Any non-government private expenses or debts would not necessarily have become public. In a letter to Liliuokalani in June, the King stated they were already in danger of running out of funds to complete the trip, and that money was owed to Italy for the education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> who had been entrusted to Moreno. The many awards and decorations he bestowed during the trip cost the kingdom more money.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, the YMMIA {{was briefly}} {{merged with the}} church's Aaronic priesthood {{organization}} and the church's organization for young women and officially renamed the Aaronic Priesthood MIA Young Women. In June 1974, this consolidation was reversed: an independent Young Women organization was restored and the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Men</b> organization was changed to Aaronic Priesthood. Also in 1974, the church eliminated the YMMIA General Presidency, placing the organization {{under the direction of}} the Presiding Bishopric. The organization's name was changed to Young Men in May 1977 and a general presidency was reinstated.|$|E
25|$|Amaluna is a touring show by Cirque du Soleil, {{created and}} {{directed}} by Diane Paulus. It premiered in Montréal, Canada, on April 19, 2012.

Paramedics and police did find {{a total of three}} screwdrivers on two of the men; when Canty testified at Goetz's criminal trial, he said they were to be used to break into video arcade change boxes and not as weapons.|$|E

Davis stated that after withdrawing cash from a bank cash machine, he was driving alone in his white Honda Civic and had stopped at a traffic light near Qurtaba Chowk in the Mozang Chungi area of Lahore when two men pulled alongside him on a motorbike. After one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> allegedly brandished a pistol, Davis opened fire and killed both of them with his own 9mm Glock pistol.|$|E
25|$|Hogan {{was born}} in Little Rock, Arkansas on November 27, 1917.

His next film had him in the featured role of Bob D. Wilson in Annapolis Salute, directed by Christy Cabanne. After small roles in Saturday's Heroes (1937), and The Storm (1938), he was again seen in a principal role in the 1938 John Ford comedy-drama, Submarine Patrol. In 1939 he appeared in Charlie Chan in Reno (1939).|$|E
25|$|The Task Force {{sought the}} {{endorsement}} of both the LDS Church and the BSA. The Church’s General Scouting Committee decided to recommend the Varsity Scouting program “with some reservations”. However, the Presidency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> <b>Men</b> grew increasingly uneasy {{and asked for a}} delay in implementation. New materials developed by the Church to support the Aaronic Priesthood Quorums had been developed and were about to be released. They felt that a simultaneous introduction of the Varsity Scouting program and the Aaronic Priesthood materials would “muscle the quorum program into the background” and that “the expectations made of the local leaders will become complicated beyond their capacity”. They went on to put forth an alternative plan that did not involve Varsity Scouting.|$|E

25|$|The {{second growth}} forests that stand today at French Creek State Park {{are made up}} of a mixture of oak, maple and other mostly {{hardwood}} trees. The land was reclaimed by the efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of the Civilian Conservation Corps created during the Great Depression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to offset unemployment. The CCC, invited to Pennsylvania by Governor Gifford Pinchot, worked to clear the forests and streams of brush. They also built many of the facilities still in use today at the park, including several tent camping areas, two small dams and lakes, two group camps, picnic areas, and extensive roads and trails throughout the park. They also began the restoration of the historic Hopewell Furnace.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, in {{the utopian}} worlds of the Greeks, there was often {{no place for}} prostitutes. In Aristophanes' play Assemblywomen, the heroine Praxagora {{formally}} bans them from the ideal city: Why, undoubtedly! Furthermore, I propose abolishing the whores … so that, instead of them, we may have the first-fruits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> It is not meet that tricked-out slaves should rob free-born women of their pleasures. Let the courtesans be free to sleep with the slaves.(v.716–719). The prostitutes are obviously considered to be unfair competition. In a different genre, Plato, in the Republic, proscribed Corinthian prostitutes {{in the same way}} as Attican pastries, both being accused of introducing luxury and discord into the ideal city. The cynic Crates of Thebes, (cited by Diodorus Siculus, II, 55–60) during the Hellenistic period describes a utopian city where, following the example of Plato, prostitution is also banished.|$|E
25|$|Antero de Quental {{studied at}} the University of Coimbra, and soon {{distinguished}} himself by unusual talent, as well as turbulence and eccentricity. He began to write poetry at an early age, chiefly, though not entirely, devoting himself to the sonnet. After the publication of one volume of verse, he entered with great warmth into the revolt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> which dethroned António Feliciano de Castilho, the chief living poet of the elder generation, from his place as dictator over modern Portuguese literature. He then travelled, engaged on his return in political and socialistic agitations, and found {{his way through a}} series of disappointments to the mild pessimism, a kind of Western Buddhism, which animates his latest poetical productions. His melancholy was increased by a spinal disease, which after several years of retirement from the world, eventually drove him to suicide in his native island.|$|E
