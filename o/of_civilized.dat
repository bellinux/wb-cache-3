The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.|$|E

25|$|Wine {{was almost}} always diluted, usually with water (or snow when the wine was to be served cold). The Greeks {{believed}} that only barbarians drank unmixed or undiluted wine and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine this way. They also believed that undiluted wine could even kill the drinker: the Gallic chieftain Brennus was recorded as having committed suicide by drinking wine full-strength. Greeks asserted that the dilution of wine with water was a mark <b>of</b> <b>civilized</b> behavior, whose contrast was embodied in {{the myth of the}} battle of Lapiths with the Centaurs, inflamed to rape and mayhem because of wine drunk undiluted with water.|$|E

Then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the Mes, the gifts <b>of</b> <b>civilized</b> life. The next morning, when Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant Isimud for the Mes, only to be informed that he has given them to Inanna. Upset at his actions, he sends Galla demons to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay at Uruk. Enki realises that he has been tricked in his hubris and accepts a peace treaty forever with Uruk.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Maya {{concept of}} 'deity', or 'divinity' (k'u in Yucatec, ch'u in Ch'ol, and qabuvil in ancient Quiché) is poorly understood, but can {{by no means}} {{be reduced to a}} mere {{personification}} of natural phenomena. The life-cycle of the maize, for instance, {{lies at the heart of}} Maya belief, but the role of the Maya maize god transcends the sphere of agriculture to embrace basic aspects <b>of</b> <b>civilized</b> life in general (such as writing). Deities have all sorts of social functions, related to such human activities as agriculture, midwifery, trade, and warfare. Moreover, they can be the patrons of large kin-based or ethnic segments of society, as shown by the four deities presiding over the four wards of Itzamkanac; the Popol Vuh Triad (including Tohil); and possibly also by the Palenque Triad (G I, II, and III) and its Classic Period analogues elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Between 1846 and 1903, the Catholic Church had {{experienced}} {{two of its}} longest pontificates in history up to that point. Together Pius IX and Leo XIII ruled {{for a total of}} 57 years. In 1914, the College of Cardinals chose della Chiesa at the young age of 59, indicating their desire for another long-lasting pontificate at the outbreak of World War I, which he labeled “the suicide <b>of</b> <b>civilized</b> Europe.” The war and its consequences were the main focus of Benedict XV. He immediately declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from that perspective to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917. Both sides rejected his initiatives. German Protestants rejected any “Papal Peace” as insulting. The French politician Georges Clemenceau regarded the Vatican initiative as being anti-French. Having failed with diplomatic initiatives, Benedict XV focused on humanitarian efforts to lessen the impacts of the war, such as attending prisoners of war, the exchange of wounded soldiers and food deliveries to needy populations in Europe. After the war, he repaired the difficult relations with France, which re-established relations with the Vatican in 1921. During his pontificate, relations with Italy improved as well, as Benedict XV now permitted Catholic politicians led by Don Luigi Sturzo to participate in national Italian politics.|$|E

500|$|In the {{illustration}} of Peter {{standing by the}} locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident {{in the moment of}} the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, [...] "Peter began to cry" [...] is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter’s emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader’s identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony.

He recruited some of his close relatives and his classmates from the Teluk Blanga Malay school into the bureaucracy, and also set up an advisory council which included two Chinese leaders.
