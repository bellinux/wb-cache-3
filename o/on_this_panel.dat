500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>panel</b> and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, maybe she {{tried to do that}} and didn't get a lot of support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but even I know of Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|E
