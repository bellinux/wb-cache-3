25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see <b>ohmic</b> <b>heating).</b> Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 43) This report {{presents a}} finite-difference computational method {{to analyze the}} rail thermal transients of a space-based, convectively-cooled, multiple-shot, electromagnetic launcher. The technique can be employed for any internally or externally cooled rail configuration and with any coolant fluid, including liquid metals. Either an exponential or linear temperature profile, {{as a result of}} the <b>ohmic</b> <b>heat</b> generation incurred during the electromagnetic current pulse, can be evaluated. The technique was then utilized to analyze various rail configurations, coolant methods, and coolant fluids. For this study, an assumed initial energy distribution is input to the launcher rail and the process of <b>ohmic</b> <b>heat</b> generation is neglected. The analysis, therefore, gives a first order approximation since cooling is more severe when ongoing heat generation is present. Within this context, the study provides significant physical insight into the rapid cooling within the rail. The result of the analysis was the assessment of cooling methods to maximize the rate of heat removal from the rail structure...|$|R
25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to <b>ohmic</b> <b>heating</b> (also called I2R loss).|$|E
2500|$|Railguns face {{a host of}} {{technical}} challenges before they {{will be ready for}} battlefield deployment. First, the rails guiding the projectile must carry very high power. Each firing of the railgun produces tremendous current flow (almost half a million amperes) through the rails, causing rapid erosion of the rail's surfaces (through <b>ohmic</b> <b>heating,</b> and even vaporization of the rail surface.) [...] Early prototypes were essentially single-use weapons, requiring complete replacement of the rails after each firing. Another challenge with the railgun system is projectile survivability. The projectiles experience acceleration force in excess of 100,000g. In order to be effective, the fired projectile must first survive the mechanical stress of firing and the thermal effects of a trip through the atmosphere at many times the speed of sound before its subsequent impact with the target. In-flight guidance, if implemented, would require the onboard navigation system to be built to the same level of sturdiness as the main mass of the projectile.|$|E

When it is large, it drives a continuous quantum phase transition into a magnetic state. The transition can be understood as the condensation of `magnetic' vortices, leading to confinement of the elementary `charge' excitations.

50|$|Early {{stellarator}} designs used {{a system}} {{similar to those}} in the pinch devices to provide the initial heating to bring the gas to plasma temperatures. This consisted of a single set of windings from a transformer, with the plasma itself forming the secondary set. When energized with a pulse of current, the particles in the region are rapidly energized and begin to move. This brings additional gas into the region, quickly ionizing the entire mass of gas. This concept was referred to as <b>ohmic</b> <b>heating</b> because it relied on the resistance of the gas to create heat, in a fashion not unlike a conventional resistance heater. As the temperature of the gas increases, the conductivity of the plasma improves.

50|$|Since {{the plasma}} is an {{electrical}} conductor, {{it is possible}} to heat the plasma by inducing a current through it; in fact, the induced current that heats the plasma usually provides most of the poloidal field. The current is induced by slowly increasing the current through an electromagnetic winding linked with the plasma torus: the plasma can be viewed as the secondary winding of a transformer. This is inherently a pulsed process because {{there is a limit to}} the current through the primary (there are also other limitations on long pulses). Tokamaks must therefore either operate for short periods or rely on other means of heating and current drive. The heating caused by the induced current is called ohmic (or resistive) heating; it is the same kind of heating that occurs in an electric light bulb or in an electric heater. The heat generated depends on the resistance of the plasma and the amount of electric current running through it. But as the temperature of heated plasma rises, the resistance decreases and <b>ohmic</b> <b>heating</b> becomes less effective. It appears that the maximum plasma temperature attainable by <b>ohmic</b> <b>heating</b> in a tokamak is 20-30 million degrees Celsius.
