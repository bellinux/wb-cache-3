30|$|A second {{situation}} {{that can give}} rise to transitivity in the network, for either ethno-nationalist or religious/ideological groups, is an environment with multiple terrorist groups. For example, extreme right and extreme left groups may be active in the same region and their overlapping attacks may form transitive patters. This two-group process is illustrated in the right column of Figure 3. Furthermore, a multi-group region need not be populated with groups of opposing ideals in order to form transitive triads. Bapat[22] provides an explanation for why infighting between groups with a common opponent is common, especially as peace processes progress. When a target state makes a move towards peace with its attackers, that move will usually involve active negotiations with one or several groups. In order to get their desired concessions, the <b>negotiating</b> <b>group</b> must moderate its behavior. This, however, is often not welcome by other groups or by radicals within the <b>negotiating</b> <b>group.</b> If the <b>negotiating</b> <b>group</b> is successful, it will, at best, seize power away from rival groups or, at worst, seize power away from rivals while negotiating a settlement that is unacceptable to a broad swath of rivals and radicals; either way, rival groups {{have an incentive to}} resist the change and radicals within the <b>negotiating</b> <b>group</b> have an incentive to form splinter groups. Resisting groups have been known to launch spoiler campaigns agains the target state (attacks designed to provoke the target state and make peace less likely) or launch attacks directly on the <b>negotiating</b> <b>group.</b> At the same time, the <b>negotiating</b> <b>group</b> needs a monopoly on terrorist violence in order to be a reliable negotiating partner for the government, so it has an incentive to crack down on dissidents and rivals.|$|R
40|$|The North-South divide {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{political}} characteristics of the UN climate change negotiations. But while the Group of 77 coalition has been the main <b>negotiating</b> <b>group</b> for the South, developing countries have often faced challenges to their unity, magnified by the recent establishment of smaller <b>negotiating</b> <b>groups.</b> How has 'the South' hung together? This thesis investigates how developing countries have formed <b>negotiating</b> <b>groups</b> over the two decades of the UN climate negotiating process. It explains the origins of the different <b>negotiating</b> <b>groups</b> that have formed over this time, as well as the timing of their emergence and the scope of their membership. In particular, while scholarly attention has focused on the G 77, Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and most recently the Brazil-South Africa- India-China (BASIC) coalition, this thesis corrects the relative neglect in understanding the many other <b>negotiating</b> <b>groups</b> that have formed. While conventional explanations highlights the shared material interests that underpin group formation, this thesis advances a constructivist argument that emphasises instead the importance of collective identities in shaping norms of 'appropriate association' – the social bases of whose one's friends and allies are. It highlights the regional basis for many of these <b>negotiating</b> <b>groups</b> that cut across shared material circumstances, and draws upon historical institutionalist insights on critical junctures and path dependence to place this larger pattern of Southern coalition formation in the appropriate historical and institutional context of the UN system. It demonstrates the continuing persistence of countries identifying as the 'South', where despite changing material circumstances and disagreements among developing countries, the salience of the G 77 as the constitutive institution of this identity remains. Above all, in investigating the processes of coalition formation among developing countries in the climate context, this thesis deepens scholarly understanding about the contemporary meaning of the 'South'.
