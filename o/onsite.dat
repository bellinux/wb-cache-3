5|$|The library {{supports}} {{the use of}} public transportation and active transportation by virtue of its central location in a dense, walkable district served by numerous bus routes, and by providing <b>onsite</b> bike parking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the complex is an open stage, a craft center, and a pendopo for special events. This has {{included}} weddings, colouring contests, training sessions, and seminars. A variety of activities and facilities are available <b>onsite,</b> including ATVs, flying fox, jet skis, and fishing. Boats leave from a dock and travel through a canal to Lake Rawa Pening.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through nasal swabs of <b>onsite</b> personnel. Of the 9,837 nasal swabs taken, 335 samples had detectable {{levels of}} alpha particle activity, although none was above acceptable levels. Urinalysis was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Then in 1968, despite {{academic}} protests worldwide, Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev {{ordered the}} destruction of Königsberg Castle, thus making any <b>onsite</b> research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible. In more recent years, {{the search for the}} Amber Room has continued in different locations including near Wuppertal, Germany.|$|E
5|$|William Hunt, the <b>onsite</b> {{architect}} {{employed to}} oversee Blore's design, while remaining faithful to Blore's overall plans, {{was not afraid}} to alter them. Most notably, the Western Gatehouse, the main approach to the palace, was intended to have octagonal towers, but Hunt redesigned the gatehouse in an English 14th-century castle style, with solid round towers and machicolations, nearly identical to the towers at Bodiam Castle, East Sussex.|$|E
5|$|In a pre-dawn raid, {{at about}} 3:00 on 17 February, around 1,000 police were {{dispatched}} {{to clear the}} Pearl Roundabout of an estimated 1,500–3,000 individuals staying overnight in tents. According to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, police were armed with sticks, shields, sound bombs, tear gas and shotguns. They moved on protesters from two directions, the flyover north of Pearl Roundabout and Noaim, south of the roundabout. In addition, personnel from NSA and BDF were <b>onsite.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>onsite</b> control tower, the airport is home to Melbourne Centre, an air traffic control facility {{that is responsible for}} the separation of aircraft in Australia's busiest flight information region, Melbourne FIR. Melbourne FIR monitors airspace over Victoria, Tasmania, southern New South Wales, most of South Australia, the southern half of Western Australia and airspace over the Indian and Southern Ocean. In total, the centre controls 6% of the world's airspace. The airport is also the home of the Canberra approach and Melbourne approach facilities, which provide control services to aircraft arriving and departing at those airports.|$|E
5|$|The main {{campus of}} HCI in Bukit Timah covers 72 acres, {{making it one}} of the largest in Southeast Asia. The campus land is shared between the Hwa Chong Family of Schools, which also include Hwa Chong International School and Hwa Chong Institution Boarding School. Also <b>onsite</b> is the Bukit Timah campus of the Singapore University of Social Sciences and its {{administrative}} headquarters. Despite the multi-sharing, each entity possesses its own set of facilities, marked by certain perimeters.|$|E
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer <b>onsite,</b> as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found <b>onsite.</b> In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An <b>onsite</b> commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} rediscovered in the 1950s, and the Territorial Commission on Historic Sites cleared and {{stabilized}} the ruins <b>onsite.</b> However, the site deteriorated {{over the next}} 30 years {{due to a lack}} of maintenance. A fund was created by the Historic Hawaii Foundation in 1998 to pay for preservation work on the ruins, which was completed two years later. An archaeological survey was also conducted around this time. Today, the site is managed by the State Historic Preservation Division of Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) with the help of the Historic Hawaii Foundation and other local preservation organizations, including the Aha Hui Malama O Kaniakapūpū. Kaniakapūpū was added as site 66000293 to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.|$|E
5|$|Workshops, {{later to}} be known as the East Workshops, were built to {{rehabilitate}} prisoners, and aid in site construction. A blacksmith's shop was constructed in 1852, and a carpenters’ shop was added in 1858. The prison was designed to have other services <b>onsite,</b> including a kitchen, with four boilers, scullery, pantry, cool room and stores; a bakehouse and ovens, with separate stores for flour and bread; as well as a washhouse, laundry and drying room. The building holding these services was completed in 1855. A separate building, a hospital providing medical services, was also planned, but was one of the last to be constructed. The foundations were laid in 1857, but the plans were changed the next year to provide additional space to isolate contagious or dangerous patients. The hospital was finished in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum <b>onsite.</b> Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from <b>onsite</b> security officers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Onsite</b> {{sanitation}} (or on-site sanitation) {{is defined}} as a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected, stored or treated at the same location (or on the same plot) where they are generated. Examples are pit latrines and septic tanks. On-site sanitation systems are often connected to fecal sludge management systems where the fecal sludge that is generated <b>onsite</b> is treated as an offsite location. A related term is a decentralized wastewater system which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an <b>onsite</b> sewage facility can treat the wastewater generated locally.|$|E
