Organic semiconductors are superior to inorganic ones for low-cost and large-area optoelectronics due to their flexibility, easy deposition, and broad variety, making tailor-made materials possible. However, electrical doping of organic semiconductors, i. e. the controlled adjustment of Fermi level that has been extremely important to the success of inorganic semiconductors, is still in its infancy. This review will discuss recent work on both fundamental principles and applications of doping, focused primarily to doping of evaporated organic layers with molecular dopants. Recently, both p- and n-type molecular dopants have been developed that lead to efficient and stable doping of organic thin films. Due to doping, the conductivity of the doped layers increases several orders of magnitude and allows for quasi-Ohmic contacts between organic layers and metal electrodes. Besides reducing voltage losses, doping thus also gives design freedom in terms of transport layer thickness and electrode choice. The use of doping in applications like OLEDs and organic solar cells is highlighted in this review. Overall, controlled molecular doping can be considered as key enabling technology for many different organic device types that can lead to significant improvements in efficiencies and lifetimes. Molecular doping of organic semiconductors has become the key enabling technology for highly efficient and long-living organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and made them commercially viable.

50|$|Currently, CSSNC LED {{efficiency}} {{is less than}} that of <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs.</b> However, studies show that they have potential to accomplish what <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs</b> cannot. CSSNC LEDs constructed using multiple layers of CSSNCs resulted in poor conduction, charge imbalance, low luminescence efficiency, and a large number of pinhole defects. LEDs constructed of one monolayer avoid these problems. An advantage of CSSNC <b>LEDs</b> over <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs</b> is that CSSNC LEDs have narrower emissions, as narrow as 32 nm, than <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs,</b> which range from 50-100 nm. Specifically, the core-shell motif is desirable for use in LEDs because of their electroluminescence and photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and their ability to be processed into devices easily. Current aims for LED displays include developing materials with wavelength emissions of 610-620 nm for red displays, 525-530 nm for green displays, and 460-470 nm for blue displays. This is because these wavelengths maximize the perceived power and they lie outside of the National Television System Committee standard color triangle. CSSNCs have been synthesized that meet these wavelength emissions: (CdSe)ZnS for red emission, (CdS)ZnS for blue emission, and (CdxZn1−xSe)CdyZn1−yS for the green emission. Using CdSe core and ZnS or CdS/ZnS shells, the maximum luminance values of red, orange, yellow and green LEDs were improved to 9,064, 3,200, 4,470 and 3,700 cd m−2, respectively; electroluminescent efficiency (1.1-2.8 cd A21), and turn-on voltages (3-4 V) were also increased.|$|R

40|$|Single walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) are quasi {{one dimensional}} molecule formed with pure sp 2 carbon-carbon bonding. They are chemically stable, near ballistic transporters, and have high surface area. According to their chiral vector and diameter, {{they can be}} either metallic or semiconducting. They are {{a new class of}} material in the nanometer range which has unique physical and chemical properties. Their unique one dimensional character gives them unusual electrical properties. A method of manufacturing thin films made of 100 % SWNTs was explored. The carbon nanotube films made by this method are thin enough to be transparent, yet still conducting. The electrical and optical properties of those films have been studied, as well as application examples for integrating the film into opto-electrical devices. The SWNT films made by this method have following advantages: they are thickness controllable, uniform, transparent, conducting, and formed at room temperature. We found the SWNT films were comparable in terms of the conductivity and transparency to the standard industry transparent electrode, indium tin oxide (ITO). An optical analog of SWNT based FET was constructed which demonstrated the ability to shift the Fermi level of the SWNT film by about 0. 9 eV. We can shift the Fermi level by such large amount is due to the one dimensional characteristic of SWNT such that the density of states (DOS) of the nanotubes are finite and easy to be filled or emptied upon injecting or depleting electrons by applying a gate field. This unique feature makes the SWNT film favorable in making ohmic coupling to usually difficult materials, like GaN. The SWNT film has been demonstrated to form ohmic contact with p-GaN light emitting diode (LED). Studies on using SWNT as anode for constructing <b>organic</b> <b>LED</b> (<b>OLED)</b> have shown great hopes. Several challenges of this system have been identified and further research is still on the way. The heterojunction between SWNT film and silicon has been investigated. The carrier injection across the p-silicon and nanotube film junction has been modulated by a factor of 300 by application of a gate voltage of less than 2 V. The contact barrier was found sensitive to the environment. Both oxygen and other component of the atmosphere (most likely water vapor) will contribute to the junction resistance change. The n-silicon and nanotube film will form Schottky barrier and showed photovoltaic effect. Patterning the SWNT films to sub-millimeter range was demonstrated, which can be beneficial to all the applications. In summary, the SWNT film provides a new type of film for electrical coupling to opto-electronic devices as well as various inorganic and organic materials. The ease of Fermi level tunability for this nanotube film provides the new opportunity for working {{with a wide range of}} materials, including previously proven to be difficult ones...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} few years solid state {{lighting}} (SSL) based on inorganic light emitting diodes (LED) is a highly efficient source of white light compared to traditional incandescent lamps. Currently, <b>organic</b> <b>LED</b> (<b>OLED)</b> are a developing competitor to inorganic LED in SSL. In contrast to inorganic LED, OLED are large area light sources, which could open up new applications. Flexible substrates or even complete transparency is possible. However, presently, efficiency, lifetime and cost of production are not competitive compared to inorganic LED. Commonly, small organic molecules are deposited under high vacuum conditions (vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE)). In contrast to VTE, this work investigates an alternative deposition technique (organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD)). The goal of this work is to generate new insights into the active organic layers of OLED by utilizing OVPD-specific deposition properties and to develop a competitive white OVPD-OLED. To begin, the long-term and temperature stable injection of holes from the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode to first organic layer is investigated, discussing different options to enhance and stabilize hole injection. Results support the theoretical description of the developed interface energetics and the goal of a long-term (> 2500 h) injection even at high temperatures (70 °C) is achievable. Investigation of interface stabilization is followed by that of an advanced organic material structure in the emission layer (EL). The mixture of hole conductor, electron conductor and emitter results in a laterally broad recombination zone and low drive voltage. However, such a mixture is sensitive to process as well as operation parameters. As further development the constant mixture ratio is extended to a continuously changed mixture ratio versus EL position (cross-fading (CF)). By investigation of mixed EL (constant mixture ratio as well as CF) an advanced and deeper understanding of the processes (voltage losses, position and thickness of the recombination zone, diffusion of excitons) in the EL and EL interfaces is generated. Application to two-color yellow and monochrome red OLED (18. 4 % external quantum efficiency, 29. 7 lm/W, at 1000 cd/m 2) is demonstrated. The goal of stable color coordinates and high efficiency at different operation parameters is achieved. Another area of investigation is the study of different hole conductors in a CF-EL of monochrome red OLED. A concept to increase the lifetime by employing exciton transfer molecules is introduced and investigated. At a luminance of 1000 cd/m 2 a lifetime of red OLED of over 130 000 h can be extrapolated. For the utilized emitter (Ir(MDQ) 2 (acac)) this is probably the highest published value and is a major advancement. In summary, this work successfully created insights in hole injection, the processes in the EL, as well as degradation mechanisms. New concepts to considerably increase the efficiency and lifetime are developed. Finally, a hybrid white OLED (21. 6 lm/W, > 1000 h lifetime, color rendering index (CRI) of 85, at 1000 cd/m 2 and color coordinates (CIE 0. 45 / 0. 42)), which is suitable for general illumination is presented and properties are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{impressive}} features, both in {{a design}} and technical aspect, of the <b>Organic</b> <b>LED</b> (<b>OLED)</b> lighting technology have attracted {{the interest of}} the research and commercial world and have recently be in the spotlight of the automotive industries, like the Lighting Department of Audi. Some of the most exciting features of these lights are the exibility, transparency and the very small thickness. It is reasonable, therefore, that in order {{to take full advantage of}} this new technology the electronics that drive these lights, that is the dc/dc converter, should also be characterised of low prole, exibility and small size. A boost towards the direction of the converter minimization and high power density operation could be the recently commercialised power switching technology of Gallium Nitride (GaN) devices. This technology, which exploits the advantages of the wide band gap semiconductors, offers high frequency, high power density, low switching losses operation and low profle design, as well. As every newly commercialised technology, the areas of application that at most exploit the advantages of these switches are still to be found, but it is expected that applications that require high power density or low profle features, like the OLED applications, could benefit the most from the GaN technology. This area is the exact topic of the current master thesis. At this project a dc/dc converter based on GaN switching devices is designed and built. The converter is purposed for the driving of Organic LED lights that belong to the tail light system of a vehicle. As such, the electrical, mechanical and thermal specifications of the converter are based on the guidelines of the Lighting Department of the Audi automotive industry and the nature of the Organic LED lighting. At this thesis, the required dc/dc converter is designed, built, measured and assessed for its adequacy to the defined requirements. During the design part of this project the necessary simulations are conducted. For the purpose of estimating the losses of the GaN device a detailed analytical model for the switching transients is used. Also, both the possibilities of using a planar and a discrete coil are investigated during the simulations and the two components, which were built in the lab, are compared experimentally. A final prototype of the converter is also built in the lab and the experimental and simulated results are then compared and assessed. The assessment of the results showed that the features of the GaN device can be fully exploited at this application and can offer the low profile and high power density requirements. In order, however, to achieve the minimization of the magnetic component more advanced and wider range of core materials are required, especially if a planar coil is desired. Finally, full exploitation of the detailed analytical GaN loss model requires specialised software tools or accurate analytical models in order to determine the values of the various parasitics and the thermal resistance of the component, both strongly related to the PCB layout. This, also, means that during the design procedure in order to achieve better accuracy -which is required at applications which push the frequency to the limits - the PCB design layout parameters should be included in the iterative process of the parameter specificationElectrical Sustainable EnergyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} of the electrical generation of light 150 years ago by Thomas Swan changed the world fundamentally. Before, the circadian rhythm {{was determined by the}} natural light of the sun. All of a sudden, it became possible to bring light into the darkness without being dependent on the weak light of candles or paraffin lamps. Ever since, electrical light sources {{play a crucial role in}} modern society. In the early 20 th century, the technology of fluorescent tubes was introduced in addition to incandescent bulbs. However, until today both these light sources comprise several disadvantages. The most fundamental deficiency of incandescent bulbs surely is their very low efficiency of about 15 lm/W, which results in a high amount of lost heat. Furthermore, their lifetime is limited to 1000 - 2000 hours. Due to this, they have to be replaced frequently and also can pose a safety risk if they are employed in traffic lights, for example. Fluorescent lights, however, offer a high efficiency of about 90 lm/W. Nevertheless, the unfavorable design limits their popularity especially in the private environment. Another disadvantage is the fact that fluorescent tubes mostly contain mercury, which leads to environmental problems if they brake or are improperly disposed. A universal light source has to fulfill a couple of requirements for different applications. The brightness and chromaticity should be tunable by the manufacturer and in addition to this, it should offer maximum flexibility in regard to the design. Furthermore, a high efficiency in order to save energy and minimize the heat loss is required for almost every application. Obviously, all these requirements together cannot be fulfilled by fluorescent tubes, energy saving lamps and even less by incandescent bulbs. A solution to this problem is the physical effect of electroluminescence (EL), which is the direct conversion of current to light. This concept is applied in light emitting diodes (LED). Especially <b>organic</b> <b>LED</b> (<b>OLED)</b> offer the potential to achieve all requirements of a universal light source as described above. In regard to lighting, OLED have tremendous advantages: They are thin, lightweight and generate a diffusive light which does not create sharp transitions from bright to dark areas. These properties do not only render OLED as promising candidates for general lighting, but also for applications such as signage, decorative lighting or automotive interior lighting. In theory, OLED can be manufactured in arbitrary shapes. In combination with a multitude of possible colors or even the dynamic tuning of the emission color, they are ideal solutions for advertising applications. Last but not least, OLED possess an enormous energy saving potential. It is generally acknowledged that OLED, in principle, have the capability to exceed the efficiencies of modern fluorescent tubes. This would result in a more economic consumption of energy and thus, direct benefit for the environment. During the manufacturing process, no heavy metals are required and the glass or plastic foil which is used as a substrate can be fully recycled. Therefore, OLED are promising candidates to substitute conventional light sources in many areas of application. Nevertheless, some challenges have to be mastered before OLED are ready for the introduction into the market. Many research groups worldwide are working on the improvement of OLED efficiencies, especially for white emitting devices. Other important aspects for OLED are their reliability and lifetime. These can be advanced by optimizing the charge carrier balance in the devices, the development of novel organic materials or the improvement of encapsulation technologies. In regard to the conception of pre-pilot systems for the manufacturing of devices on an industrial scale, the evaluation of different deposition technologies is a fundamental matter. In this work, the technology of organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD), which was invented by Prof. S. Forrest at Princeton University, is investigated. Monochrome and white emitting devices as well as organic single layers were fabricated. Due to the fact that OVPD is a relatively young technology compared to the established vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE), a primary goal of this work was to generate an understanding in regard to the impact of various process parameters on the performance of OLED. While for VTE systems, the tunable process parameters are mostly limited to the deposition rate, OVPD offers several precisely adjustable parameters such as deposition chamber pressure, substrate temperature and carrier gas flow. As of today, the influence of these variables on the organic thin films and devices is vastly unknown. The impact of various parameters during the gas phase deposition process was investigated in this work and in addition to this, crucial technological aspects for OVPD systems were identified...|$|E
50|$|Siemens OSRAM {{subsidiary}} produces lighting products including incandescent, halogen, compact fluorescent, fluorescent, high-intensity discharge and Xenon lamps; opto-electronic semiconductor light {{sources such}} as light emitting diodes (<b>LEDs),</b> <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs,</b> high power laser diodes, LED systems and LED luminaires; electronic equipment including electronic ballasts; lighting control and management systems; and related precision components.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{conjugated}} dendrimers as a novel molecular architecture for <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs</b> is investigated. Control of colour {{is demonstrated}} using materials {{based on a}} porphyrin, anthracene and distyrylbenzene core with stilbene dendrons. The resulting dendrimers are solution processible and give photoluminescence and electroluminescence in the red, green and blue regions of the spectrum...|$|R
40|$|The use of phenylenevinylene based dendrimers for <b>organic</b> <b>LEDs</b> was investigated. We {{have found}} when {{a family of}} distyrylbenzene centred dendrimers were used as the {{light-emitting}} layers in LEDs that the efficiency was dependent on the dendrimer generation number. A maximum efficiency of 0. 09 % was observed in an ITO/ second generation dendrimer/Ca device...|$|R
50|$|Ingo Maurer created many objects using LEDs, {{the first}} being the {{lighting}} object Bellissima Brutta in 1996. In 2001 he presented a table lamp with LEDs {{with the name}} EL.E.Dee. Since 2006, he is also experimenting with organic light-emitting diode (<b>Organic</b> <b>LEDs),</b> presenting two objects in 2006, and a table lamp as limited edition.|$|R
50|$|Digital sign {{displays}} may be LCD or plasma screens, LED boards, {{projection screens}} or other emerging display types like interactive surfaces or <b>organic</b> <b>LED</b> screens (OLEDs). Rapidly dropping prices for large plasma and LCD screens {{have led to}} a growing {{increase in the number of}} digital sign installations. An array of these displays is known as a video wall.|$|R
