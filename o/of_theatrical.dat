The Chicago production ran in 1969 and 1970 at the Blackstone Theatre, operated {{at that time}} by The Shubert Organization. Dugan was able to design sound but not allowed to operate the mixing console {{because he was not}} in the stagehands union: International Alliance <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> Stage Employees (IATSE).|$|E
5|$|During filming, {{the crew}} and several cast members objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin and camera {{operator}} John Stanier's European style of single-source lighting, which involved the use of incense burners. In response, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the International Alliance <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> Stage Employees (IATSE) halted the production, and forbade Parker from using smoke on the set due to the noxious atmosphere it created.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Hungarian {{newspaper}} Life and Literature {{revealed that}} Szabó {{had been an}} informant of the Communist regime's secret police. Between 1957 and 1961, he submitted forty-eight reports on seventy-two people, mostly classmates and teachers at the Academy <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> and Cinematic Arts. According to historian Istvan Deak, only in one case did Szabó's informing cause significant damage, when an individual was denied a passport.|$|E

He designed the lavish apartments on the 7th and 8th floors; the Oliver Messel Suite is named after him, designed in the Georgian country house style. Between 1988 and 1990, the hotel was completely renovated by Bob Lush of the Richmond Design Group at a cost of US$100million.|$|E

5|$|Szabó is {{the most}} internationally famous Hungarian filmmaker since the late 1960s. Working in the {{tradition}} of European auteurism, he has made films that represent many of the political and psychological conflicts of Central Europe’s recent history, as well as of his own personal history. He made his first short film in 1959 as a student at the Hungarian Academy <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> and Cinematic Arts, and his first feature film in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The museum's current {{building}} was earlier home to Amadeo's theatre, the first theatre in Zagreb. Formed in 1797 by Antal Amade de Varkony, the prefect of Zagreb County, it operated until 1834. In 2000, Amadeo's theatre was revived as a yearly summer series <b>of</b> <b>theatrical</b> plays entitled Scena Amadeo ("Amadeo Scene") {{held in the}} museum atrium.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, Animal House {{received}} generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time and Roger Ebert proclaimed {{it one of}} the year's best.

5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} {{undercut}} their own long-term financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source <b>of</b> <b>theatrical</b> income {{was a new}} James Bond film {{every two or three}} years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong arguments for the rights to do such films.|$|E
5|$|He shot 70 films {{over the}} sixteen {{years of his}} career, working with such {{prominent}} directors as William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, Michael Curtiz, Archie Mayo, and William Dieterle. He {{was a member of}} the American Society of Cinematographers by 1921, and he was also one of the inaugural members of the International Photographers branch of I.A.T.S.E. (International Alliance <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> Stage Employees). In October 1932, at the height of his career, he suddenly fell ill after wrapping a film. Hospitalized, his condition quickly worsened and within a week he was dead of an infection to the brain.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors <b>of</b> <b>theatrical</b> effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

In Australia, also being distributed by UIP, it was released on December 26, 2000 where it earned over $11 million during the theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music may also be a part <b>of</b> <b>theatrical</b> productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

The image was captured by Margaret Bourke-White as part of a series taken to document the Ohio River flood of 1937. The cover, which was designed by band member John Flansburgh with Elizabeth van Itallie, originally featured only the photo; however, an emblem including the band's name, inked by Flansburgh's former coworker Barbara Lipp, was later added. The emblem resembles the logo of the International Alliance <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> Stage Employees.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{difficulties}} in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California to County Cork, Ireland, in 1970, and continued {{with a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>theatrical</b> and cinematic appearances throughout that decade. These included leading roles in the stage musicals Gypsy, , and The King and I, {{as well as in}} the hit Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). Moving into television, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the American whodunit series Murder, She Wrote, which ran for twelve seasons from 1984 until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running and most popular detective drama series in television history. Through Corymore Productions, a company that she co-owned with her husband Peter Shaw, Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. She also moved into voice work, thereby contributing to animated films such as Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991). Since then, she has toured in a variety of international theatrical productions and continued to make occasional film appearances.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Szabó {{wanted to}} be a doctor like his father. By the age of 16, however, he had been {{inspired}} by a book by Hungarian film theorist Béla Balázs to become a film director. Upon graduation from high school, he became one of 11 applicants out of 800 who were admitted to the Academy <b>of</b> <b>Theatrical</b> and Cinematic Arts. At the Academy, he studied with the famous director Félix Máriássy, who became something of a father figure to Szabó. Among his classmates were Judit Elek, Zsolt Kézdi-Kovács, Janos Rozsa, Pál Gábor, Imre Gyöngyössy, Ferenc Kardos, and Zoltán Huszárik. While at the Academy, Szabó directed several short films, culminating in his thesis film, Koncert (1963), which won a prize at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Thanks to János Herskó, head of the Hunnia Film Studio at which he apprenticed, Szabó was given his first opportunity to direct a feature film at the age of 25, rather than being required to spend ten years working as an assistant director.|$|E
