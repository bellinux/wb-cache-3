40|$|Circular {{dielectric}} cavities are {{key components}} {{for the construction}} of optic microresonators and microlasers. They are one of very few cases where the transcendental equations for complex eigenmodes (resonances) of an open system (dielectric cavity) can be found analytically in an exact manner. The behaviour of those eigenvalues in the small <b>opening</b> <b>limit,</b> i. e. when the refractive index of the cavity goes to infinity, is analysed. The analysis allows one to clearly distinguish between internal (Feshbach) and external (shape) resonance modes for both TM and TE polarizations. As a result, unambiguous azimuthal and radial modal indices are assigned to each internal and external resonance mode. ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{resonance}} distributions in {{a circular}} dielectric cavity. It is shown that the decay-rate distribution has a peak structure and {{the details of the}} peak are consistent with the classical survival probability time distribution. We also investigate the behavior of the complex resonance positions at the small <b>opening</b> <b>limit.</b> At the large $n$ limit, the real part of complex resonance positions approaches the solutions with different $m$ of Dirichlet problem with a scale $n^{- 2 }$ and the imaginary part goes zero as $n^{- 2 m}$ for TM and $n^{- 2 (m+ 1) }$ for TE polarization, where $m$ is the order of the resonance.

40|$|Circular microresonators (microdisks) are micron size {{dielectric}} disks {{embedded in}} a material of lower refractive index. They possess modes with complex eigenvalues (resonances) which are solutions of analytically given transcendental equations. The behavior of such eigenvalues in the small <b>opening</b> <b>limit,</b> i. e. when the refractive index of the cavity goes to infinity, is analyzed. This analysis allows one to clearly distinguish between internal (Feshbach) and external (shape) resonant modes for both TM and TE polarizations. This {{is especially important for}} TE polarization for which internal and external resonances {{can be found in the}} same region of the complex wave number plane. It is also shown that for both polarizations, the internal as well as external resonances can be classified by well-defined azimuthal and radial modal indices. ...|$|E

40|$|Outer {{resonances}} are studied as {{one type of}} quasinormal modes in two-dimensional dielectric cavities with refractive index $n> 1 $. The outer resonances can be verified as the resonances which survive only outside the cavity in the small <b>opening</b> <b>limit</b> of the dielectric disk. We have confirmed that the outer resonances universally exist in deformed cavities irrespective of the geometry of cavity and they split into nearly degenerate states in slightly deformed cavity. Also we {{pointed out that the}} effective potential analogy is inapplicable to the description of outer resonances. Since most outer resonances in the dielectric cavities have quite high leakages, they would affect to the broad background in the density of states. Especially, for TE polarization case, relatively low-leaky outer resonances exist and it presents the possibility that they can interact with the inner resonances and affect lasing modes...|$|E
40|$|This study places Dubofsky’s (1992) “limit order {{adjustment}} hypothesis ” {{under the}} microscope of an intraday analysis, which employs a minute-by-minute trade and quote data recorded during the ex-dividend days of common stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. Dufosky’s (1992) model concluded that the asymmetric adjustment of open limit orders for cash dividend payments under the NYSE and AMEX rules is sufficient to create abnormal returns on the ex-dividend day. Empirical evidence shows that the limit order bias incurred due to the asymmetric adjustment of open limit orders seems to dominate the overnight ex-day returns {{but at the same}} time, it is significantly corrected via active trading up until the close of the ex- dividend day. As a result, the significant association of the ex-day price drop discrepancy with the <b>opening</b> <b>limit</b> order bias eventually disappears before the ex-dividend day close. Finally, it is found that the reversal of the limit order bias is in fact quicker in stocks which are more liquid or listed on NASDAQ where strong competition among dealers is envisaged to drive stale quotes closer to the fair adjustment of the dividend.

40|$|Temporomandibular {{disorders}} (TMD), {{recognized as}} the most common conditions of chronic orofacial pain, have a multifactorial etiology. Acupuncture can help to relieve the pain and discomfort associated with these conditions, because it can rebalance the energy (Qi) circulating in the meridians. The aim {{of the study was}} to verify the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating the pain; mouth opening limitation, and energy circulating in the meridians of patients with TMD of muscular or mixed origin. This was a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted at the Piracicaba Dental School (FOP/Unicamp), in Piracicaba SP, Brazil. The Treatment Group received acupuncture with real penetration of the needle, and the Placebo Group received a sham treatment without needle penetration. The acupoints used were: ST 6, ST 7, SI 18, GV 20, GB 20, BL 10, and LI 4, during treatment performed for four weekly sessions. The TMD and mouth opening were evaluated according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC). The measurements of the energy at the meridians were performed by the Ryodoraku method, before and after acupuncture in all of the sessions in both groups. The results showed no decrease in pain in the Treatment Group when compared with the Placebo Group (p =  0. 2261). There was no increase in the oral <b>opening</b> <b>limit</b> in the Treatment Group compared with the Placebo Group (p >  0. 05). Regarding the energy levels, after acupuncture, there was a decrease in Yang energy in all sessions (p <  0. 05), in both groups, however, only real acupuncture was effective in maintaining the Yin energy average throughout the four sessions, with significant difference between groups (p =  0. 0198). In conclusion, volunteers with TMD presented a pattern of energy deficiency and the most prevalent imbalance patterns identified were in the meridians coupled to the kidney and bladder, and in the Shao Yin (heart/kidney) and Shao Yang (triple energizer/gall bladder) energetic planes. The acupuncture points used were equally effective in reducing pain in both groups; increasing the unassisted mouth opening limitation without pain in the Treatment Group, and were also effective in preserving the Yin energy in the Treatment Group. The Yang energy decreased equally in both groups...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{uses the}} {{philosophy}} of Jacques Derrida to propose a performative method of close reading, which it uses to explore the relationship between language and identity in early modern literary representations of magicians. It addresses the common assumptions we make about the authority and stability of language by exploring the tensions that arise as the magicians attempt to use performative language to realise impossible ambitions of absolute power, knowledge and self presence. The texts studied are a combination of prose and drama from 1512 to 1607. They are read in light of Derrida’s engagement with speech act theory in ‘Signature Event Context’ and ‘Limited Inc a b c... ’, and also other related work of his on the performative foundations of literature and the law, including ‘Before the Law’, ‘The Law of Genre’, and ‘Force of Law: The ‘Mystical Foundations’ of Authority’. The final chapter also takes in Aporias. The magicians’ trajectories are followed in three chapters. The first is on the founding violences of their authoritative identities. Working with Derrida’s accounts of the law, it begins by describing how the foundation of authority is self-authorizing and therefore performative. It then explores how performative pacts, deals and contracts with the devil are used to establish and authorize the magicians and their supernatural worlds. This metatextual authority {{is reflected in the}} magician’s own ambitions for the certainty and stability of absolute power and knowledge. Using the early modern sense of ‘perform’ as to complete, carry out or make something, the second chapter focuses upon materiality and embodiment as attempts to stabilise or fix performative utterances. Fake suicide notes and contracts written in blood are analysed to demonstrate the slip and drift equally at work in the structures of writing and signatures. In addition, Friar Bacon’s enormous brass head with its promise of ‘sound aphorisms’ is discussed as an alternative example of the misinformed urge to embody certainty. The final chapter addresses why almost all the stories of magicians, good and bad, end with their deaths. Following Derrida’s Aporias, death is represented as the ultimate <b>opening</b> <b>limit,</b> which undermines all attempts at certainty and self-presence. This leads to discussion of the other’s role in identity and, it follows, death. The magicians’ ends are compared, with particular focus on the sense of a coming event in the final scene of Doctor Faustus. The use of Derrida’s work to engage with early modern texts responds to a significant gap in the field. It offers original, contemporary insight into traditional themes of power, language and identity that are usually approached from a historicist perspective. The critical-creative close reading describes and carries out by the thesis suggests an exciting way to performatively respond to literature of the past, bearing witness to it but also transforming it into something new...|$|E

40|$|A new Generalized Minimum Variance {{control law}} has been derived {{recently}} for the controlof nonlinear multivariable systems.

One ofthe well-known problems associated with input saturation is the integral windupphenomenon, which occurs whenever the controller includes integral action. In this paper,we show that the classical form of the 'anti-windup' mechanism can be obtained withinthe Nonlinear GMV controller framework by a suitable selection of the design parameters. The advantage of the approach is that the anti-windup mechanism is obtained naturallyfrom the optimization problem. There is also the possibility that the technique can beextended for other specialized nonlinear compensation problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of pinhole single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{depends on the}} spatial resolution of the gamma-ray detectors used. Pinhole cameras suffer from strong resolution loss due to the varying depth-of-interaction (DOI) of gamma quanta that enter the detector material at an angle. We eliminate DOI effects in a scintillation gamma camera via a dedicated optic fiber bundle {{that acts as a}} focusing collimator for light generated in a scintillation crystal. A curved crystal is connected to a concavely shaped fiber-optic bundle such that the fibers connect perpendicularly to the crystal's convex surface and point straight at the pinhole <b>opening.</b> <b>Limiting</b> the fiber numerical apertures can be used to suppress resolution losses due to light spread. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this prototype position-sensitive gamma sensor successfully eliminates DOI effects, and has an intrinsic resolution of better than 280 µm full width at half maximum with an interaction probability of 67 % for 140 keV photons. Therefore, the detector has great potential for increasing the resolution of pinhole SPECT. RRR/Radiation, Radionuclides and ReactorsApplied Science...|$|R
