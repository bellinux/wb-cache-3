25|$|Coast Aero Center {{was awarded}} the {{concession}} on 20 June 1986 for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. It was flown using a Beechcraft Super King 200. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} too bad, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. The airline had a revenue of NOK 14 million and had 24 employees in 1986. That year, they chose to connect to the PNR/Smart booking system. The company bid for <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> of the Norwegian Air Ambulance in 1987, but failed.|$|E

25|$|Other {{elements}} {{to the production}} were done {{by a variety of}} BBC designers. The Heart of Gold and B Ark models were built by Perry Brahan. The small, furry creature from Alpha Centauri in Episode 3 was a puppet designed and controlled by Jim Francis, who also built the Magrathean bubble car (also seen in Episode 3), and was the stunt double for Richard Vernon in the scene in which the bubble car was seen to fly. Matte paintings throughout the series were created by Jean Peyre. Music and sound effects were by Paddy Kingsland, {{with the exception of the}} theme music; the familiar Journey of the Sorcerer theme by Bernie Leadon was used again, in the arrangement by Tim Souster that had previously been used for the Hitchhiker's LP. Video effects using the Quantel system were done by Dave Jervis. Other puppets, including insects seen in Episode 5, were designed by Susan Moore. Some of the actual puppeteering was done by Stuart Murdoch, including <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> of the Dish of the Day animal.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of the Automated Manufacturing System reconfiguration is to react to failures such as breakdowns of actuators or sensors. Following such events, the control laws run by the control system are often blocked and thus become inadequate. Thus, it is therefore necessary to reconfigure the control system. This reconfiguration process is inevitably based on the capacities still offered by the <b>operating</b> <b>part</b> to achieve the production objectives. In this context, the paper proposes an on-line function diagnosis able to provide the required information on the capacities of the <b>operating</b> <b>part.</b> It {{is based on a}} model of the <b>operating</b> <b>part</b> in normal operation, and generic rules to obtain the possible origins and consequences of a detected symptom of failure...|$|R

2500|$|Fixed C-Arms do {{not have}} these limitations, but require more space in the room. These systems can be mounted either on the floor, the ceiling, or both if a biplane system is chosen. The latter is the system of choice if {{pediatric}} cardiologists, electrophysiologists or neurointerventionalists are major users of the room. It is not recommended to implement a biplane system if not clearly required by these clinical disciplines, as ceiling-mounted components may raise hygienic issues: In fact, some hospitals do not allow <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> directly above the surgical field, because dust may fall in the wound and cause infection. Since any ceiling-mounted system includes moving parts above the surgical field and impairs the laminar airflow, such systems are not the right option for hospitals enforcing highest hygienic standards.

50|$|The Gustloff Volkssturmgewehr uses a gas-delayed {{blowback}} action {{based on}} the Barnitzke system, whereby gas bled from the barrel near the chamber creates resistance to the rearward impulse of the <b>operating</b> <b>parts,</b> which ceases when the projectile leaves the muzzle, allowing the <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> to be forced rearward by the residual pressure of the cartridge case. This principle has been used most successfully in the Heckler & Koch P7 pistol.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, {{there were}} last-ditch efforts to develop cheap {{so-called}} Volksgewehr rifles in the 7.92×33mm caliber. One of these, the VG 1-5 (Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), used a gas-delayed blowback action based on the Barnitzke system, whereby gas bled from the barrel near the chamber created resistance to the rearward impulse of the <b>operating</b> <b>parts,</b> which ceases when the projectile leaves the muzzle, allowing the <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> to be forced rearward by the residual pressure of the cartridge case.

50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} Krag-Jørgensen action was its magazine. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag-Jørgensen was integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the <b>operating</b> <b>parts),</b> featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, single cartridges were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} gas-operated firearms, direct impingement does {{away with}} a separate gas cylinder, piston, and operating rod assembly. High-pressure gas acts directly upon the bolt and carrier thereby saving weight, lowering costs, and reducing {{the mass of the}} <b>operating</b> <b>parts,</b> and thereby the wear on mechanical parts due to movement. By removing the gas piston, the potential amount of moving mass is lowered, thus decreasing the potential for a disrupted sight picture, as caused by the mass of the piston adding to the disruptive mass.|$|E
5000|$|Most current gas systems employ {{some type}} of piston. The face of the piston is acted upon by {{combustion}} gas from a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. Early guns such as Browning's 'flapper' prototype, the Bang rifle, and Garand rifle used relatively low-pressure gas from {{at or near the}} muzzle. This, combined with more massive <b>operating</b> <b>parts,</b> reduced the strain on the mechanism. To simplify and lighten the firearm, gas from nearer the chamber needed to be used. This high pressure gas has sufficient force to destroy a firearm unless it is regulated somehow. Most gas-operated firearms rely on tuning the gas port size, mass of <b>operating</b> <b>parts,</b> and spring pressures to function. Several other methods are employed to regulate the energy. The M1 carbine incorporates a very short piston, or [...] "tappet". This movement is closely restricted by a shoulder recess. Excess gas is then vented back into the bore. The M14 rifle and M60 GPMG use the White expansion and cutoff system to stop (cut off) gas from entering the cylinder once the piston has traveled a short distance. Most systems, however, vent excess gas into the atmosphere through slots, holes, or ports.|$|E

50|$|Though marketed {{together}} with the CAR-15, the CMG-1 had few parts in common with it. One CMG-1 used direct impingement and shared the bolt, gas tube, and other <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> of the M16. However, other CMG-1s used gas pistons. The CMG-1s also used the M16's pistol grip, front sight block, and flash hider. Similar to the Stoner 63, the CMG-1 could be fed from either side. The rate of fire was 650 rounds per minute. Only two or three CMG-1s were ever made. Colt made them with sheet-metal stamping.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the action}} halts {{cartridge}} extraction momentarily, the R51 can use higher pressure cartridges than a straight blowback firearm with similar slide weight. [...] The hesitation-locked Model 53 {{was based on}} the Model 51 design, and was built by Remington in [...]45 ACP for Navy trials. The Pedersen design has the recoil spring surrounding the barrel, reducing the pistol's overall profile. Lighter <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> and longer lock time provide less felt and actual recoil. The R51's low bore axis gives less muzzle rise which also lowers perceived recoil, while the stationary barrel improves accuracy and simplifies construction.|$|E

50|$|Because the breech is locked, this pistol {{can handle}} greater {{pressures}} than a blowback firearm yet without {{the size and}} weight penalty of other locking systems. The design also allows the recoil spring to be placed around the barrel making for a shorter profile gun. Lighter <b>operating</b> <b>parts</b> and longer lock time provide less felt and actual recoil. A lower bore axis gives less muzzle rise which also lowers felt recoil. A fixed barrel allows for greater accuracy and reliability as well as simplifying construction compared to other locking systems. Overall, this system is lighter than a blowback, simpler than any conventional locking mechanism, and has less recoil than either of the other systems.|$|E
50|$|ICP-AES is {{used for}} motor oil analysis. Analyzing used motor oil reveals {{a great deal about}} how the engine is <b>operating.</b> <b>Parts</b> that wear in the engine will deposit traces in the oil which can be {{detected}} with ICP-AES. ICP-AES analysis can help to determine whether parts are failing. In addition, ICP-AES can determine what amount of certain oil additives remain and therefore indicate how much service life the oil has remaining. Oil analysis is often used by fleet manager or automotive enthusiasts who have an interest in finding out as much about their engine's operation as possible. ICP-AES is also used during the production of motor oils (and other lubricating oils) for quality control and compliance with production and industry specifications.|$|E
