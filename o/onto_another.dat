5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza would take care of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom {{in the minds of the}} Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E
5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E
5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film <b>onto</b> <b>another.</b> However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
50|$|Forcible {{entry is}} defined by Merriam-webster's Dictionary of Law as the {{unlawful}} taking of possession of real property by force or threats of force or unlawful entry into or <b>onto</b> <b>another's</b> property, especially when accompanied by force.|$|R
50|$|Right {{of entry}} refers to one's {{right to take}} or resume {{possession}} of land, or {{the right of a}} person to go <b>onto</b> <b>another's</b> real property without committing trespass.

5|$|The 167 Bikini {{residents}} who {{were moved to}} the Rongerik Atoll prior to the Crossroads tests were unable to gather sufficient food or catch enough fish and shellfish to feed themselves in their new environment. The Navy left food and water {{for a few weeks}} and then failed to return in a timely manner. By January 1947, visitors to Rongerik reported the islanders were suffering malnutrition, facing potential starvation by July, and were emaciated by January 1948. In March 1948 they were evacuated to Kwajalein, and then settled <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> uninhabited island, Kili, in November. With only one third of a square mile, Kili has one sixth the land area of Bikini and, more important, has no lagoon and no protected harbor. Unable to practice their native culture of lagoon fishing, they became dependent on food shipments. Their four thousand descendants today are living on several islands and in foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|On 3/4 June 1942 MacLachlan {{infiltrated}} a {{group of}} Do 217s from KG 2 as they orbited in preparation for landing at Saint-André-sur-Orne. Within 14 seconds he had shot down two bombers and damaged two more (victories 12–13) before German defences were alerted and began returning fire. Flying with Kuttelwascher, they trailed a formation of 15 German bombers that had raided Poole. Sighting them over their own airfield he destroyed one and then was detected by searchlights. Taking evasive action he latched <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> and shot it down. A third and fourth were damaged. Kuttelwascher arrived and as MacLachlan left and claimed another He 111 and Do 217. MacLachlan saw two flashes on the ground denoting a crashed aircraft after he attacked. German records show two Do 217s shot down one crash-landed and one severely damaged. MacLachlan's first victim {{appears to have been}} Unteroffizier Gerhard Wagner's Wrk Nr. 5392 Do 217 from 3./KG 2. Wagner, Feldwebel Wilhelm Oberwohr, Unteroffizier Josef Maier and Oberfledwebel Anton Lamm were killed. Another II./KG 2 Do 217 crashed there while another was severely damaged. Another Do 217 fell 40 miles south of Cherbourg but this machine—Wrk nr. 5331 piloted by Feldwebel Hans Koch of 7./KG 2—was likely a victim of Kuttelwascher. All of the crew were killed in action. It was MacLachlan's last victory with the squadron. He flew five more intruder sorties during which he returned via Antwerp and Ostend at near-zero feet after his map had blown out the side-canopy window on 26 June and chased a Ju 88 45 miles south of Selsey Bill without result on 2 July.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Video Conference under low {{bandwidth}} condition, such as conference among hand-held sets (PDAs), requires transmission algorithm to be robust and effective. The real-time issue {{is always the}} focus of research. We propose in this paper a fast algorithm in mapping one’s facial expression <b>onto</b> <b>another’s</b> face. The algorithm divides workload into online and offline part and hence speeds up the performance. By using this, {{it is possible to}} transmit small data of facial features to end users of conference participants. Expressions can be then synthesized at end user side to produce pseudo-video-sequence of the participants. Thus, real-time transmission can be achieved. Keywords: ERI, Real-Time Video Conference, Embedded System. ...|$|R

50|$|Based on a two-and-a-half hour {{recording}} of Thanksgiving dinner conversations with friends, Tannen analyzed the two prevailing conversational styles among the six participants, which she divided evenly between {{the categories of}} New Yorker and non-New Yorker. Upon analyzing the recording, Tannen {{came to the conclusion}} that the speech of the New Yorkers was characterized by exaggerated intonations (paralinguistics), overlapping speech between two or more speakers, short silences, and machine-gun questions, which she defines as questions that are “uttered quickly, timed to overlap or latch <b>onto</b> <b>another’s</b> talk, and characterized by reduced syntactic form”. The style of the non-New Yorkers was opposite that of the New Yorkers in all regards mentioned above; furthermore, the non-New Yorkers were caught off-guard by the New Yorkers’ exaggerated intonation and interrupting questions, two factors that discouraged them from finishing their conversations at some points. Tannen refers to the New Yorkers’ style as “high-involvement” and the unimposing style of the non-New Yorkers as “high-considerateness”.|$|R

25|$|Using an {{emergency}} number recognized by a GSM phone like 112 instead of another emergency number may be advantageous, since GSM phones and networks give special priority to emergency calls. A phone dialing {{an emergency}} service number not recognized by it may refuse to roam <b>onto</b> <b>another</b> network, leading to trouble {{if there is}} no access to the home network. Dialing a known emergency number like 112 forces the phone to try the call with any available network.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the notions}} of vector length and angle between vectors can be {{generalized}} to any n-dimensional inner product space, this is also true for {{the notions of}} orthogonal projection of a vector, projection of a vector <b>onto</b> <b>another,</b> and rejection of a vector from another. In some cases, the inner product coincides with the dot product. Whenever they don't coincide, the inner product is used instead of the dot product in the formal definitions of projection and rejection.|$|E
