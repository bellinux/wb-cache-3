So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well.

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} <b>our</b> <b>fourth</b> brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E
500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed <b>our</b> <b>fourth</b> plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were going to be sitting with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had <b>our</b> <b>fourth</b> consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{seashore}} recreation {{survey in}} the mid-1930s {{resulted in a}} recommendation that 12 major stretches of unspoiled Atlantic and Gulf Coast shoreline, with [...] of beach, be preserved.

All but one — Cape Cod — had become commercial developments. A new shoreline surveys resulted in several major reports including Our Vanishing Shoreline (1955); A Report on the Seashore Recreation Survey of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (1955); <b>Our</b> <b>Fourth</b> Shore, Great Lakes Shoreline Recreation Area Survey (1959); and Pacific Coast Recreation Area Survey (1959).

The group primarily worked with RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Stargate, Fernando Garibay, up-and-coming production team the Smeezingtons (Phillip Lawrence and Bruno Mars). One of the album's tracks, [...] "No More You", was written by Ne-Yo. Keisha Buchanan compared the song to Rihanna's [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow". The group also collaborated with Sean Kingston. Sugababes also joked that [...] "Rihanna's been like <b>our</b> <b>fourth</b> member, listening to all our songs and saying what she liked and what she didn't like." [...] Buchanan told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the album has [...] "definitely got the British feel throughout the album - we've not gone away and gone 'All American' on our fans." [...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. I think the one thing we wanted to do was come back with something different."

30|$|Despite our {{positive}} outcomes, {{there are}} a number of limitations worth noting. First, the study was conducted in an ICU of a single hospital, so the results may not be broadly generalizable. Second, we did not collect data based on the positions of hospital staff (e.g., interns, residents, fellows, attending physicians) who inserted the central catheters, or the varying experiences of attending physicians versus interns, for example, regarding CVC insertion. This raises the possibility that differences in behavior/experience other than the implementation of the educational program may have accounted for these results. Third, we did not record the duration of central venous catheterization or the number of lines in individual patients. An unrecognized reduction in the duration of catheterization or the number of lines could have influenced <b>our</b> results. <b>Fourth,</b> <b>our</b> study design does not allow us to determine which aspects of the intervention accounted for the reduction in the rate of CRBSIs. Another potential limitation is that we did not evaluate outcomes other than bloodstream infection. As a result, we cannot determine whether the intervention influenced antibiotic utilization, length of hospital stay, mortality, or antibiotic resistance patterns.|$|R

60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Fourth</b> of July {{which we}} honor so much, and which we love so much, and which we take so much pride in, is an English institution, not an American one, {{and it comes}} of a great ancestry.

That is {{the day of the}} Great Charter--the Magna Charta--which was born at Runnymede in the next to the last year of King John, and portions of the liberties secured thus by those hardy Barons from that reluctant King John are a part of our Declaration of Independence, of <b>our</b> <b>Fourth</b> of July, of our American liberties. And the second of those Fourths of July was not born, until four centuries later, in, Charles the First's time, in the Bill of Rights, and that is ours, that is part of our liberties.
