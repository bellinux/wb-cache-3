40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} single-sex education on student’s motivation. To estimate the impact of boys <b>only,</b> <b>girls</b> <b>only</b> and mixed education, we run an experiment in a large Flemish school. By randomizing 13 to 14 years old students to homogenous and heterogeneous gender groups, we observe in a quantitative analysis that the gender composition significantly influences the motivation of students. In comparison to the boys <b>only</b> group, <b>girls</b> <b>only</b> and mixed gender groups experience a significantly lower motivation due to the group composition. The impact on motivation deteriorates {{with the number of}} girls. The quantitative findings are confirmed by observational evidence from a qualitative assessment. status: publishe...|$|R
