50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the <b>oil</b> <b>gallery.</b> The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver {{it to the big}} end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big end bearings. A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod big end has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{pressure}} is higher when {{the engine is}} cold due to the increased viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. Oil {{pressure is}} lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive oil pressure may indicate a blocked filter, blocked <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> or the wrong grade of oil. Low oil pressure indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|E

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft journal bearings (main bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into <b>oil</b> <b>galleries,</b> from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the main journals and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the <b>oil</b> <b>galleries</b> to the main bearings enters holes in the main journals of the crankshaft.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{retained}} {{from the}} W-series design were the race-proven Moraine M400 aluminum bearings first {{used in the}} 409, {{as well as the}} highly efficient [...] "side oiling" [...] lubrication system, which assured maximum oil flow to the main and connecting rod bearings at all times. Later blocks intended for performance use had the main <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> moved up to the cam bearing bore area and provided [...] "priority main" [...] oiling, improving the oil system even further. These features, along with the robust crankcase design, sturdy forged steel crankshaft and massive four-bolt main bearing caps used in the high performance versions, resulted in what many have considered to be the most rugged and reliable large displacement automotive V8 engine design of all time.|$|E
5000|$|The W-series {{engine was}} made of cast iron. The engine block had 4.84 in bore centers, two-bolt main bearing caps, a [...] "side oiling" [...] {{lubrication}} system (the main <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> located low on the driver's side of the crankcase), with full-flow oil filter, and interchangeable cylinder heads. Heads used on the high performance 409 and 427 engines had larger ports and valves than those used on the 348 and the base 409 passenger car and truck engines, but externally were identical to the standard units. One minor difference between the 348 and 409/427 was {{the location of the}} engine oil dipstick: it was on the driver's side on the former and the passenger's side on the latter. No satisfactory explanation was ever offered for why this change was made. However, it did provide a fairly reliable way to differentiate between the smaller and larger versions of the engine.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low oil pressure. 1) no oil or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with oil pressure as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> fracture or blockage. Low oil pressure can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low oil pressure may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low oil pressure is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The experimentation was performed at the Guhring, Inc. (a tool manufacturingcompany) in Germany. The MQL drilling machine, machine operators, CNC programming, hole drilling, andtool layouts were be provided by Guhring. The main components of this experiment were the MQL machinewith dual channel system, machine tool fixture, special carbide drills, data acquisition system, thermal opticalcamera to measure surface temperature, and computers. The surface along the axis of the of the <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> holewas milled to produce uniform thickness of 2. 5 mm. The drill was spinning but not moving into the engineblock, the engine block was moving into the drill. All experiments were performed in random order with noreplications. The other output variables, surface finish, true position, roundness, straightness, diameter andmisalignment, were measured by a surface analyzer and coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Findings: Based on this research {{it can be concluded}} that MQL is a viable production solution for DHDin automotive cast aluminum alloy. Good part quality characteristics were achieved using this method withproduction feeds and speeds. Practical implications: The MQL method has shown potential to be even more productive as compared totraditional deep hole drilling which would result in less capital investment.

40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} model is {{developed for the}} complete oil supply system of a scroll com-pressor. The system includes oil sump, pickup tube, <b>oil</b> <b>gallery,</b> bearings, and associated oil feed holes, vent, and port. There are two fluids, oil and gas, inside the system. The flow is numerically simulated as a heterogeneous EulerianâEulerian turbulent multi-phase flow. The investigation covers the entire working process of the scroll compressor from dry-start to steady state. Two design parameters, initial oil sump depth and viscosity, are studied comparatively. The detailed oilâgas flow inside the oil supply system {{is characterized by the}} field quantities. The physical mechanisms controlling oil supply rate are defined. The oil supply rate and the bearing prime time (the time after which oil is flowing through a bearing) are obtained. The results can be used to design and optimize the oil supply system to improve the reliability and efficiency of scroll compressors...|$|E

40|$|The oil {{distribution}} system of an automotive {{light duty engine}} typically has an oil pump mechanically driven through the front-endancillaries-drive or directly off the crankshaft. Delivery pressure is regulated by a relief valve to provide an <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> pressure of typically 3 to 4 bar absolute at fully-warm engine running conditions. Electrification of the oil pump drive {{is one way to}} decouple pump delivery from engine speed, but this does not alter the flow distribution between parts of the engine requiring lubrication. Here, the behaviour and benefits of a system with an electrically driven, fixed displacement pump and a distributor providing control over flow to crankshaft main bearings and big end bearings is examined. The aim has been to demonstrate that by controlling flow to these bearings, without changing flow {{to other parts of the}} engine, significant reductions in engine friction can be achieved. The study has been conducted on a 1. 5 litre, 4 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. By reducing the feed pressure to the bearings from a baseline pressure of 3 bar absolute to 1. 5 bar absolute, reductions in engine rubbing friction mean effective pressure of up to 14 % has been achieved at light load. Similar reductions in friction were recorded across a speed range of 1000 - 2000 rev/min and net indicated mean effective pressures up to 3. 5 bar. The ranges were conservatively limited to protect against bearing damage. The paper reports details of the oil system modifications and the test results. The fuel economy benefit due solely to the friction reduction, not including any benefit from a reduction in oil pump work, is around 1 Â½ % over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). The reduction in friction is demonstrably significant and represents an area with great potential to improve engine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{diesel engines}} are being {{continuously}} developed {{in order to}} improve their specific output thus reducing the fuel consumption. This is in response to both increasingly stringent regulations and {{to the demands of the}} customer evolving. With this in mind a more detailed understanding of some of the fundamental processes within the engine are required. A prime example of one of these processes is heat transfer. In the region of 17 - 35 % of fuel energy will pass to the coolant, therefore the rate of heat transfer has a considerable effect on the design and function of the engine. This thesis describes a method to calculate heat transfer through a combustion chamber wall of a modern production engine and uses the data to improve the understanding of the impact of active thermal management systems on the rate of heat transfer and how this can be incorporated into empirical modelling, also improving fundamental understanding and evaluating established correlations focusing on the warm-up period. Development of prototype engines over extended test schedules can prove expensive, therefore in order to reduce the necessary test and development period of a new engine it is useful to be able to predict the heat transfer within the combustion chamber using modelling data. A large number of correlations have been developed over the years, however with the rate of development of the diesel engine; some of these correlations have been left behind. A number of steady state operating conditions were employed to approximate the New European Drive Cycle. By approximating the drive cycle performance it was possible to further the understanding of the effect of changing the engine operating conditions on the temperature distribution in key areas of the engine, including the crankshaft bearings, camshaft bearings and combustion chamber walls. The main focus of this thesis is the cylinder wall temperatures and the rate of heat transfer through the cylinder wall from the combustion gases. It was found that there was a temperature rise of 7 Â°C between the oil in the main <b>oil</b> <b>gallery</b> and that used to lubricate the journal bearings; however the oil in the camshaft bearings was found to decrease in temperature along the inlet camshaft but increase along the exhaust camshaft. In addition the temperature and heat transfer profiles were significantly different between the inlet and exhaust sides of the engine. Existing correlations were found to in general over-predict the gas side convective heat transfer coefficients at high power conditions. The accuracy of these correlations could be improved by 77. 6 % by modifying the correlation coefficients; however the introduction of a cylinder wall temperature component, in addition to modifying the correlation coefficients, led to an improvement in the correlation by a further 17. 4 %. Prototype hardware and a Design of Experiments (DoE) based test programme were used to investigate the impact of actively changing the external oil and coolant circuits during a New European Drive Cycle on the engine warm-up. It was found that the driving force for improved warm-up when throttling the engine coolant flow was the increase in the gas side wall temperature, and the reduction in the local coolant temperature. The coolant local to the combustion chamber wall was cooler as it remained isolated from the majority of the external cooling system. In addition, the low engine coolant flow retained the heat energy which had been transferred through the cylinder wall, within the engine structure. This unique approach of combining cylinder wall temperature measurements and active thermal management systems allowed for the fundamental heat transfer paths to be explained. The insight obtained during the steady state experiments and the transient tests was then used to evaluate the potential to calculate the convective heat transfer during different stages of the engine warm-up. A strong correlation, a R-squared of between 0. 77 and 0. 83, was found between the rate of energy transfer to coolant across the engine and the gas side convective heat transfer coefficient during early stages of the drive cycle, however this decayed as the engine warmed up. A correlation was also found between the convective heat transfer coefficient and the temperature used by the ECU for engine control, in this case measured in the cylinder head. The modified convective heat transfer correlation developed in this thesis allows for the gas side convective heat transfer coefficient to be estimated at different stages of the engine warm-up based on the average cylinder wall temperature. This was not possible with existing correlations and could significantly improve thermal modelling during engine warm-up. The findings of this thesis are relevant to engine designers, combustion simulation engineers and thermal management teams as 1 -D modelling will continue to play a significant role in the development process of internal combustion engines for the foreseeable future. This is primarily due to the cost implications of high performance computers for 3 -D modelling; therefore the development of these models remains vital...|$|E
