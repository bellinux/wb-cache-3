5|$|Interstate 8 freeway {{follows the}} {{northern}} edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point</b> Loma peninsula, paralleling the San Diego River, and terminates {{a few blocks from}} the Pacific Ocean. Rosecrans Street is the north/south avenue that serves the bay side of Point Loma, while Sunset Cliffs Boulevard is the north/south avenue on the ocean side; the two streets run parallel to each other and to Catalina Boulevard on the crest of the hill. The former California State Route 209 followed Rosecrans and Catalina to the southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point.</b> Sports Arena Boulevard, West Point Loma Boulevard, Harbor Drive and Nimitz Boulevard are other major traffic pipelines in Point Loma.|$|E
5|$|Loop Head is the {{headland}} {{at which}} County Clare {{comes to a}} point {{on the west coast}} of Ireland, with the Atlantic on the north, and further inland on the south, the Shannon estuary.

5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of entry or exit.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> from S. The aim of this proposition is {{to determine how the}} force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
2500|$|For any {{natural number}} n, an n-dimensional sphere, or n-sphere, {{can be defined}} as <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> <b>points</b> in an (n+1)-dimensional space which are a fixed {{distance}} from a central <b>point.</b> For concreteness, <b>the</b> central <b>point</b> can be taken to be the origin, and <b>the</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> on <b>the</b> sphere from this origin can be assumed to be a unit length. With this convention, the n-sphere, S'n, consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> (x1,x2,…,x'n + 1 [...] ) in Rn + 1 with x12+x22+⋯+x'n + 12=1. For example, <b>the</b> -sphere consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> (x1,x2,x3,x4) in R4 with x12+x22+x32+x42=1.|$|R

This was significant because it marked the completion of the total electrification of the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{visitors}} at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point,</b> which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 {{at a cost of}} £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main version number and then the number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E

5|$|The route {{began at}} a {{turnaround}} {{next to the}} Old Point Loma Lighthouse in the Cabrillo National Monument, near {{the southern tip of}} Point Loma. Heading north along the crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point</b> Loma peninsula, it passed through Fort Rosecrans Military Reservation and Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery before exiting the former through a gate and entering the Wooded Area neighborhood of Point Loma as Catalina Boulevard. SR209 passed through this residential neighborhood and provided access to Point Loma Nazarene University. The SR209 designation then made a right turn onto Cañon Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a right angle onto Rosecrans.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point</b> Loma streetcar {{line was}} considered in 1923, but the San Diego Electric Railway {{decided to keep}} it running after residents opposed {{the idea of using}} buses instead.

5|$|Beta: Arc Light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Point</b> of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E
