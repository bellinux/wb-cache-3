Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|Tombstone, {{near the}} Mexican border, {{was founded in}} March 1879. After silver was {{discovered}} in the area, Tombstone grew rapidly into a frontier mining boomtown. At its founding, it had a population of just 100, and only two years later, in late 1881, the population was more than 7,000 (excluding Chinese, Mexicans, women, and children), making it the largest boomtown in the Southwest. Silver mining and its attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants, who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. They brought a Victorian sensibility and became the town's elite. By 1881 there were fancy restaurants, a bowling alley, four churches, an ice house, a school, an opera house, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, along with 110 saloons, 14 gambling halls, and numerous brothels, all situated among a number <b>of</b> <b>dirty,</b> hardscrabble mines.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a still image {{of a woman in}} her bikini (Manuela Arbeláez) while various scenery backdrops are {{superimposed}} in the background. The first scenes of the video flicker between Diddy’s life with his femme fatale and Diddy singing with the rest <b>of</b> <b>Dirty</b> Money in the bedroom of a mansion. Some of the possessions in the house such as picture frames shatter as the chorus builds up. However, during Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper’s verses, the camera focus on Richard and Harper singing directly into the camera lens. As Drake’s verse begins, Diddy falls backwards into a swimming pool in slow motion, while the camera image slowly fades into a club scene. There is a brief shot of a bottle of coconut-flavored Cîroc vodka before Diddy is scene mingling in the club. The camera mainly focus on Drake, who is observing what is happening and rapping his verse. During the bridge, Richard and Harper appear in the club and Diddy’s femme fatale is seen in the background.|$|E

25|$|The {{death toll}} formed an {{important}} impetus to modern environmentalism, and it caused a rethinking of air pollution, as the smog had demonstrated its lethal potential.

25|$|There {{are many}} causes for the {{perception}} in wine faults, including poor hygiene at the winery, excessive or insufficient {{exposure of the}} wine to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to sulphur, overextended maceration of the wine either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization of the wine, the use <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging {{and the use of}} poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage of the wine that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.|$|E
25|$|The Ganga Action Plan, {{which was}} taken on {{priority}} and with much enthusiasm, was delayed for two years. The expenditure was almost doubled. But {{the result was}} not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt {{to make it a}} success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.|$|E

25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is a pelagic {{schooling}} species which {{is found in}} both far offshore oceanic environments {{as well as more}} protected inshore environments. The fish commonly are found in the upper water column near the surface waters. It is not found in estuaries and appears to be intolerant <b>of</b> <b>dirty</b> or turbid waters. The range of the species extends to more southern waters in summer as the warm waters push further down the coasts.|$|E

Juveniles reportedly inhabit shallow bays close to the coast, and are occasionally seen near beaches. Adults live in much deeper water, normally between 30 and 60 m, although have been recorded at depths of around 90 m.|$|E
