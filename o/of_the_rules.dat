40|$|After decades <b>of</b> neglect, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is much on <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> legal {{scholars}} today. In the United States, the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v. Gore has triggered {{renewed interest in}} understanding <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and its value to society. Transition and developing economies have increasingly come to recognize <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in establishing a framework for economic growth and individual liberty. This essay {{provides an overview of}} these debates over the concept and consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. Although American scholars have criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore as violative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, this criticism rests on an erroneous understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, as expressed by Dicey, Oakeshott, Hayek, and others, is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. Moreover, this tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is a cornerstone of a free and prosperous society, in America and abroad. ...|$|R
40|$|Formal conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{are popular}} among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> coherence <b>of</b> accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law committed to these conceptions is sometimes fractured by elements harkening back to substantive conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. I {{suggest that this}} may be because at its origins <b>the</b> ideal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law was substantive through and through. I also argue that those origins are older than is generally supposed. Most authors tend to trace <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because <b>the</b> founding moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> western intellectual reflection on <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law placed concerns about substantive justice at <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given <b>the</b> rhetorical power <b>of</b> appeals to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R

5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings.

5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences.

40|$|This book {{analyses}} <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> international law, through <b>the</b> {{case law}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Human Rights. It investigates how {{the court has}} defined and interpreted <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in its jurisprudence. It places this analysis {{against a background of}} more theoretical accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, drawing in ideas of political philosophy. It also provides a comparative assessment, demonstrating how <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law has evolved in the UK, France, and Germany. The book argues that at <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law are <b>the</b> notions <b>of</b> legality and judicial safeguards. It states that the Court has developed <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> legality, which <b>the</b> work analyses in detail, based on that concept. It assesses <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary as an aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Convention on Human Rights, and the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> substantive contents <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> book posits that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law as seen at the Court is not mainly utilised with regard to ‘freedom’ rights, but is more concerned with procedural rights. It discusses the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Convention as a constitutional instrument <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European public order, and shows that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and democracy are inextricably linked in <b>the</b> case law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court. Ultimately, the book demonstrates in its analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court’s jurisprudence that <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is a crucial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international legal order...|$|R

Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball.

40|$|In his article, Professor Krieger {{discusses}} the inconsistent and contradictory application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional <b>rule</b> against retroactive ratemaking.
