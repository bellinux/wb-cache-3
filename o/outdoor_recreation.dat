40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show the impact of <b>outdoor</b> {{adventure}} <b>recreation</b> on female veterans who have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study followed a phenomenological approach in order to gain an overall view of what the veterans experienced, using observation and interviews in order to gather information. Conclusions showed female veterans desire female-veteran-only activities; desire relationships with fellow female veterans; and enjoy <b>outdoor</b> adventure <b>recreation</b> that includes teamwork, planned activities, and relaxation. In order to ensure the best possible avenue for PTSD health in female veterans, future research may include a focus on the impact of repeatable trips, more interviews over an extended period of time, as well as, how <b>outdoor</b> adventure <b>recreation</b> is perceived and accepted by different sample groups of female veterans...|$|R
5|$|There {{is a great}} {{tradition}} of public access and <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation</b> in the area. The Peak District formed a natural hinterland and rural escape for the populations of industrial Manchester and Sheffield, and remains a valuable leisure resource in a largely post-industrial economy.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Department of Recreational Sports, the BGSU Outdoor Program offers outdoor trips, {{an indoor}} {{climbing}} wall, team-building, and an outdoor equipment rental center to BGSU students, faculty, staff and surrounding community members. In August 2008 the program introduced the Freshman Wilderness Experience, which couples a week-long backpacking trip on the Appalachian Trail with a monthly class to assist students in transitioning {{from high school to}} college life. In 2009 The Outdoor Program won the David J Web Award by the Association of <b>Outdoor</b> <b>Recreation</b> and Education (AORE) as an outstanding non-profit outdoor program.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation</b> {{opportunities}} {{exist at}} {{and near the}} pass. Between the pass and Difficult Campground, 3 miles (4.8km) east of Aspen, there are many popular rock climbing areas, some with grades up to 5.12 under the Yosemite Decimal System. The Grotto Wall across from Lincoln Gulch campground is a frequent destination. Closer to the pass are Instant Karma Cliff and Putterman's Dome. A pair of rocks along either side of Highway 82 on the east approach to the pass are popular bouldering spots.|$|E
50|$|Stuntz had {{interest}} {{not only}} in science, but also in arts. He played the piano well and had a great love on classic chamber music. However, Stuntz's father did not think the art is a practical field, so the lack of encouragement from his family may have directly lead him {{to give up his}} musical interest. Besides the love of music, Stuntz also loved <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreations</b> such as hiking. In addition, he played badminton for several years and was known as an excellent player.|$|R

5|$|The {{relatively}} mild, temperate marine climate, {{allows for}} <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation</b> year round, including walking, hiking, cycling and outdoor team sports. Mountain biking is usually restricted to marked routes. Watersports like sailing, kayaking, motor boating, etc. are also popular, {{and since the}} bay rarely freezes up in winter, {{they can also be}} practised most of the year. Recreational and transportational pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, radiate from the city centre to the countryside, providing safety from motorised vehicles and a more tranquil experience. This includes the 30 kilometre long pathway of Brabrandstien, encircling the Brabrand Lake. The long-range hiking route Aarhus-Silkeborg, starts off from Brabrandstien.|$|E
5|$|The town's largest {{employer}} is Southern Oregon University (SOU), {{which has a}} faculty and staff of more than 750. In addition to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the university, health-service providers make significant contributions to the economy. Businesses related to <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation,</b> transportation, technology, and light manufacturing are also important. In 2010, the Shakespeare Festival employed about 500 people, the hospital about 400, the public schools about 300, and the City of Ashland about 250. The Bathroom Readers' Press, which produces the Uncle John's Bathroom Reader books, is based in Ashland and San Diego. Brammo, specializing in battery-electric motorcycles, was based in Ashland but moved to Talent.|$|E
5|$|Driving {{through the}} pass is challenging. Both {{approaches}} require 6% grades {{due to the}} height of the pass, and require navigating hairpin turns with advisory speeds of 10mph (15km/h). Rockfalls, particularly on the approach from Aspen, have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet (4 m) wide with temporary traffic lights. On the Twin Lakes approach, they have resulted in temporary closures. Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions, and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well. Lastly, the weather at the pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes. There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days, and snow can occur at any time of the year. CDOT advises anyone coming to the pass for <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation</b> to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather.|$|E
5000|$|The “Journal for Gentlemen” promised, in King’s words, “To {{be devoted}} to hunting, fishing, rifle and trap shooting, the {{breeding}} of thorough-bred dogs, cycling, and kindred sports…” The subscription price was $1.50 per year, with single copies selling for 15 cents. A few years later, King expounded on his philosophy: “Sports Afield has an ambition above that of simply entertaining and amusing the public; it wants to help propagate the true spirit of gentle sportsmanship, to encourage indulgence in <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreations,</b> and {{to assist in the}} dissemination of knowledge regarding natural history, photography, firearms, and kindred subjects.” ...|$|R

5|$|The valleys that delimit the massif {{were used}} as {{communication}} routes by the Romans until they left around the 5thcentury AD. The region has remained of some military importance through to the mid-20thcentury. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were discovered by the outside world in the 18thcentury. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was finally climbed in 1786, marking {{the start of the}} sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, drawing in over sixmillion visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation</b> and activities such as sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering and skiing. Around one hundred people a year die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} master plan granted outline planning permission for a 250-bed hotel {{of five to}} six storeys in height. However, property development and investment company The Beetham Organization Ltd, which has in recent years built several high-profile hotels, offices and other buildings in prominent city-centre locations in Britain, bought Block J in November 2004 and submitted a revised planning application (BH2005/00136/FP) early in 2005. This sought approval for a mixed-use development comprising one 42-storey building with 146 residential units (C3-category) and a hotel with ancillary facilities including a restaurant, cafés, conference facilities and a health and fitness centre; one six-storey building with retail units (A1- and A3-category) and a further 25 residential units; and a pedestrianised public square. The application was rejected on 20 separate counts, including the negative visual impact on surrounding listed buildings such as the railway station and St Bartholomew's Church; the reduction in quality of surrounding public spaces; the lack of provision of <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreation</b> space; {{negative effect on the}} surrounding microclimate, and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings; and the failure to consider fully the impact on transport. The reasons for the rejection were supported by various people and groups within the city, such as The Regency Society, which is involved with planning and conservation matters in Brighton and Hove.|$|E

50|$|When {{it first}} opened, the {{following}} baths and treatments were offered: Russian, Turkish, peat, Nauheim, aromatic, medicated, eucalyptus, rain, pine extract, spray, vapour, brine or sulphur baths. Many associated treatments were available: vibration-massage, the Oertel or Terrain cure, {{the sun and}} air bath, a nebulor, Metchnikoff's sour milk treatment, the Johann Schroth diet, the grape cure, the Salisbury system, a high-protein weight loss diet using Salisbury Steak or the Koumiss cure. As at Crieff Hydro there were <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreations,</b> from otter hunting to tennis, shooting, croquet and cycling, and {{a wide range of}} activities for inclement weather and the evenings. Guests were encouraged to bring their musical instruments.|$|R
25|$|Some {{people take}} part in non-sexual public nude events. These {{may be in a}} naturist resort or club or at a nude beach. <b>Outdoor</b> nude <b>recreation</b> can take place in private or rural areas, though {{generally}} limited to warm weather.|$|R
5|$|The many {{visitors}} {{who come to}} birdwatch, sail or for other <b>outdoor</b> <b>recreations</b> {{are important to the}} local economy, but the land-based activities jeopardize nesting birds and fragile habitats, especially the dunes. Some access restrictions on humans and dogs help to reduce the adverse effects, and trips to see the seals are usually undertaken by boat. The spit is a dynamic structure, gradually moving towards the coast and extending to the west. Land is lost to the sea as the spit rolls forward. The River Glaven can become blocked by the advancing shingle and cause flooding of Cley village, Cley Marshes nature reserve, and the environmentally important reclaimed grazing pastures, so the river has to be realigned every few decades.|$|R
