50|$|Merluccius albidus, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the <b>offshore</b> <b>hake,</b> offshore silver hake, or offshore whiting, is a species of fish in the Merlucciidae family. It is found on the outer (offshore) continental shelf at depths of 70 - 1170 m in the west Atlantic, ranging from New England to French Guiana. It reaches 70 cm in length and 4.1 kg in weight.|$|E
40|$|Based {{on current}} {{biological}} reference points, <b>offshore</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius albidus) is not overfished and overfishing is unknown. Based on NEFSC fall bottom trawl survey data for 2007 - 2009, the three year delta individual mean weight index (0. 16 kg/individual) {{is below the}} management threshold (0. 24 kg/individual) (Figure D 1), but the three year average recruitment index (0. 89 num/tow) is above its threshold (0. 33 num/tow) (Figure D 2). (See section: Biological Reference Points). The new 2010 assessment concluded that information is not available to determine stock status because fishery data are insufficient and survey data are not considered to reflect stock trends. Therefore, the current BRPs should be rejected. It {{was not possible to}} recommend alternative reference points. Status is therefore unknown...|$|E
40|$|The SARC- 51 Review Panel {{provided}} an independent peer review of key decisions and outputs from assessments for two stocks of silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), two stocks of red hake (Urophycis chuss) <b>offshore</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius albidus), and longfin squid (Loligo pealeii). The review was held from 29 November to 3 rd December 2010 in Woods Hole. Data and assessment reports {{were presented to}} the Panel, and issues considered against the Review Panel’s Terms of Reference through open discussion. Additional analyses were requested at the review, {{and the results were}} considered. The Panel examined whether the Working Groups responses to their Terms of Reference (ToRs) were adequate, complete, and scientifically sound, and determined whether base-case analyses were preferred for determining stock status and developing management references. The results from an analytical assessment run for silver hake were not considered adequate to serve as a basis for management advice. Concerns raised are documented in the Review Panel’s report. Management advice was based on survey estimates for all hake stocks assessed and for Loligo pealeii. The uncertainties in the assessments are fully documented within the SARC- 51 Review Panel report...|$|E
5000|$|The three {{recognized}} {{stocks of}} Pacific hake are a highly migratory offshore (or coastal) stock {{that ranges from}} southern California to Queen Charlotte Sound, a central-south Puget Sound stock, and a Strait of Georgia (SOG) stock. The <b>offshore</b> North Pacific <b>hake</b> stock spawned off south-central California to Baja California in the winter months of January and February during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. [...] In spring and summer, adults migrated northward to feed to as far as central Vancouver Island (and as far as Queen Charlotte Sound in some years). In the fall, adults migrated southward toward spawning grounds. Since the early 1990s, {{a percentage of the}} offshore stock has remained off the west coast of Canada year round and some Pacific hake have been observed spawning off the west coast of Vancouver Island. [...] Resident Pacific hake in Puget Sound spawn in Port Susan and Dabob Bay from February through April. The SOG resident stock aggregates to spawn in the deep basins of the south-central Strait of Georgia, where peak spawning occurs from March to May.|$|R
40|$|The checks {{carried out}} on the <b>hake</b> <b>offshore</b> trawl catch and effort data, which provide the basis to split the catches by species and to obtain GLM-standardised CPUE indices of {{abundance}} by species, have focused on two separate steps. The first was a re-extract of {{the data from the}} original files to check for possible errors in the earlier extracts (this applies to the subset of the data for which size composition information can be unambiguously extracted). The second step was to increase the proportion of the data utilised (and {{at the same time to}} check for possible selection biases in the existing sample) by assigning size composition to drags for which this information was not directly available, on the basis of the average for other vessels for which this was available for the area and time at which the fishing concerned took place. The first step revealed a problem with extractions over the last few years which at times for certain vessels had linked the accumulated catch for the day with only the effort for the last trawl of the day, rather than for all trawls that day combined...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Salmonid run {{sizes are}} {{strongly}} affected by their early marine stage. Fully understanding the life history of salmonids means understanding how {{they interact with}} their marine environment and with other fishes. Changes in the biological and physical environment off the Columbia River region affects the distribution and abundance of predatory fishes and their feeding, forage fishes, and juvenile salmonid marine survival. From 1998 - 2004, forage fish and predatory fish distribution and abundance off the Columbia River was quantified by surface trawling at night during spring/summer. The effect of predation on salmonids was measured by stomach analysis of predatory fishes. During the study period (1998 - 2004), forage fishes increased in abundance by orders of magnitude and were strongly related to the abundance of cold-water copepods the previous year. Higher forage fish populations were also linked to cooler ocean conditions and perhaps fewer predatory Pacific hake (Merluccius productus). Most forage fishes were distributed nearshore while predators had a more <b>offshore</b> distribution. Pacific <b>hake</b> was most abundant in 1998, 2003, and 2004; warm ocean years. Jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus) was most abundant during 1999 - 2002; relatively cool ocean years. Deep (50 -m) ocean temperatures and {{the date of the}} spring transition, when nearshore currents switched from northward to southward, were good predictors of Pacific hake abundance in the study area. Forage fish or salmonid occurrence in a haul was negatively related to the occurrence of predators. Pacific hake and jack mackerel ate primarily euphausiids and small fishes. Salmonids were rarely eaten by either predator. However, because the Pacific hake population can be very large, hake predation can be a significant source of juvenile salmon mortality off the Columbia River during some years. A trophic model showed that marine mortality of Columbia River juvenile salmonids {{may be related to the}} abundance of Pacific hake and forage fishes. A multiple regression using the predictions from the trophic model of annual numbers of juvenile salmonids eaten by hake and Columbia River spring flows as independent variables, accounted for much of the variation observed in the annual marine survival of Columbia River coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), the dependent variable. Future research should identify the physical and biological forces that alter the feeding habits, migration and movements of Pacific hake and jack mackerel off the Northwest, and how Columbia River flows affect trophic interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} demersal hake trawl is {{the largest}} sector of the South African hake fishery, which targets shallow-water (Merluccius capensis) and deep-water (M. paradoxus) Cape hakes. Economically, {{it is the most}} important fishery in South Africa, generating ZAR ~ 5 billion in revenue, mainly from exports, and it supports an estimated 30 000 jobs. Whereas {{there are a number of}} single-species and ecosystem models that assess hake stock dynamics and examine the food web dynamics of the southern Benguela ecosystem, the human social hake fishery system is less understood. In order to address this need, this study's aims are to i) analyse the structure and dynamics of the economics of the South African offshore demersal hake trawl fishery from empirical data and stakeholder interviews, and ii) produce a prototype economic simulation model of this fishery to better understand the dynamics of the industry and the relative importance of its internal and external drivers, e. g. industrial organization, environmental uncertainty, exchange rate and fuel price. The empirical analyses confirm that the <b>offshore</b> <b>hake</b> trawl fishery is an economically mature and highly vertically integrated industry. That is, most companies control much of the value-chain, catching, processing, marketing and distributing their fish products, with access to economies of scope and scale. Nine company clusters, formed through consolidation of fishing rights and a variety of catch-share agreements, have been identified. Based on their size and operations they have been categorized as small, medium, large and super-cluster types. Fishing vessel numbers have declined since 1978 to streamline operations, with current effort optimising restrictions based on vessel engine power and the ability to catch the full quota. During the observation period (2005 - 2012), high-value export markets have bought 60 - 70 % of the South African hake total allowable catch (TAC), comprising nine major markets and a number of smaller ones. The lower-value domestic market takes ca. 30 % plus imports equivalent to another ca. 15 % of TAC. Hake export volumes have shifted from fresh to frozen and increasingly to value-added products, especially after the 2008 banking crisis. This corresponds to an industry-confirmed price-convergence between fresh and frozen hake products. This product displacement trend is largely due to changes in the largest export market, Spain, and is mirrored by an increased reliance on freezer trawling in the industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend towards}} use of {{commercial}} vessels to enhance survey data requires {{assessment of the}} advantages and limitations of various options for their use. One application is to augment information on size-frequency distributions obtained in multispecies trawl surveys where stratum boundaries and sampling density are not optimal for all species. Analysis focused on ten recreationally and commercially important species: bluefish, butterfish, Loligo squid, weakfish, summer flounder, winter flounder, silver hake (whiting), black sea bass, striped bass, and scup (porgy). The commercial vessel took 59 tows in the sampled domain south of Long Island, New York and the survey vessel 18. Black sea bass, Loligo squid, and summer flounder demonstrated an onshore-offshore gradient such that smaller fish were caught disproportionately inshore and larger fish <b>offshore.</b> Butterfish, silver <b>hake,</b> and weakfish were characterized by a southwest-northeast gradient such that larger fish were caught disproportionately northeast of the southwestern-most sector. All sizes of scup, striped bass, and bluefish were caught predominately inshore. Winter flounder were caught predominately offshore. The commercial vessel was characterized by an increased frequency of large catches for most species. Consequently, patchiness was assayed to be higher by the commercial vessel in nearly all cases. The size-frequency distribution obtained by the survey vessel for six of the ten species, bluefish, butterfish, Loligo squid, summer flounder, weakfish, and silver hake, {{could not be obtained}} by chance from the size-frequency distribution obtained by the commercial vessel. The difference in sample density did not significantly influence the size-frequency distribution. Of the six species characterized by significant differences in size-frequency distribution between boats, all but one was patchy at the population level and all had one or more size classes so characterized. Although the variance-to-mean ratio was typically higher for the commercial vessel, five of the six cases that were otherwise were among the species for which the size-frequency distribution differed between the two vessels. Thus, the origin of the significant differences observed between vessels would appear to lie in the spatial pattern of the species as it interacts with the tendency for one vessel to obtain large catches more frequently for some size classes. One consequence of differential distribution and catchability is that more large fish were present in the commercial vessel catches than in the survey vessel catches in cases where the two vessels obtained different size-frequency distributions. Application of commercial vessels to the evaluation of size frequency hinges on understanding how to interpret differences among boats, gear, and sampling design. Here we show that key ingredients to this understanding are the degree of nonlinearity in catchability across a range of size classes, the interaction of varying spatial arrangements among size classes and the sampling design, and the interaction of varying spatial arrangements with differential catchability...|$|R
