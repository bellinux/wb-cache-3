40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the design}} of a CMOS {{transceiver}} circuits for CAN bus based on 0. 5 µm n-well CMOS process is presented. It has the advantages of high speed, high driving capability and strong anti-interference capability. It is mainly made up of a receiver and a transmitter which includes the input stage circuit, the middle stage circuit, the slew rate control circuit and the output stage circuit. With five cascaded inverters, the middle stage circuit can provide a high driving current and a small delay. In the slew rate control circuit, due to a variable charge or discharge current source, the slew rate of output signal could be adjusted continuously by an external resistance Rs. So it is very convenient for the chip to be applied in different modes and at different rates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive investigation on high frequency (HF) switching transients due to energization of vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs) in offshore wind farms (OWFs). This research not only concerns the modeling of main components in collector grids of an OWF for transient analysis (including VCBs, wind turbine transformers (WTTs), submarine cables), but also compares the effectiveness between several mainstream switching <b>overvoltage</b> (SOV) <b>protection</b> methods {{and a new}} mitigation method called smart choke. In order to accurately reproduce such HF switching transients considering the current chopping, dielectric strength (DS) recovery capability and HF quenching capability of VCBs, three models are developed, i. e., a user–defined VCB model, a HF transformer terminal model and a three-core (TC) frequency dependent model of submarine cables, which are validated through simulations and compared with measurements. Based on the above models and a real OWF configuration, a simulation model is built and several typical switching transient cases are investigated to analyze the switching transient process and phenomena. Subsequently, according to the characteristics of overvoltages, appropriate parameters of SOV mitigation methods are determined to improve their effectiveness. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} user–defined VCB model can satisfactorily simulate prestrikes and the proposed component models display HF characteristics, which are consistent with onsite measurement behaviors. Moreover, the employed protection methods can suppress induced SOVs, which have a steep front, a high oscillation frequency and a high amplitude, among which the smart choke {{presents a}} preferable HF damping effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Doubly fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) {{technology is the}} dominant technology in the growing global market for wind power generation, due to the combination of variable-speed opera-tion and a cost-effective partially rated power converter.

A new minimum-threshold rotor-crowbar method is presented in this paper, improving fault response by reducing crowbar application periods to 11 – 16 ms, successfully di-verting transient overcurrents, and restoring good power control within 45 ms of both fault initiation and clearance, thus enabling the DFIG to meet grid-code fault-ride-through requirements.

Familiar PNP regulator features such as reverse battery <b>protection,</b> <b>overvoltage</b> shutdown, thermal shutdown, and current limit make the CS 8126 suitable for use in automotive and battery operated equipment. Additional on−chip filtering has been included to enhance rejection of high frequency transients on all external leads.

40|$|Wind farms must {{contribute}} to the stability and reliability of the transmission grid, {{if they are to}} form a robust component of the electrical network. This includes providing grid support during grid faults, or voltage dips. Transmission system grid codes require wind farms to remain connected during specified voltage dips, and to supply active and reactive power into the network. Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) technology is presently dominant in the growing global market for wind power generation, due to the combination of variable-speed operation and a cost-effective partially-rated power converter. However, the DFIG is sensitive to dips in supply voltage. Without specific protection to 'ride through' grid faults a DFIG risks damage to its power converter due to over-current and/or <b>overvoltage.</b> Conventional converter <b>protection</b> via a sustained period of rotor-crowbar closed-circuit leads to poor power output and sustained suppression of the stator voltages. This thesis presents a detailed understanding of wind turbine DFIG grid fault response, including flux linkage behaviour and magnetic drag effects. A flexible 7. 5 kW test facility is used to validate the description of fault response and evaluate techniques for improving fault ride-through performance. A minimum threshold rotor crowbar method is presented, successfully diverting transient over-currents and restoring good power control within 45 ms of both fault initiation and clearance. Crowbar application periods were reduced to 11 - 16 ms. A study of the maximum crowbar resistance suggests that this method can be used with high-power DFIG turbines. Alternatively, a DC-link brake method is shown to protect the power converter and quench the transient rotor currents, allowing control to be resumed; albeit requiring 100 ms to restore good control. A VAr-support control scheme reveals a 14 % stator voltage increase in fault tests: reducing the step-voltage impact at fault clearance and potentially assisting the fault response of other local equipment.

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) have been recently designed {{with the aim}} of solving pollution problems caused by the emission of gasoline-powered engines. Environmental problems promote the adoption of new-generation electric vehicles for urban transportation. As it is well known, one of the weakest points of electric vehicles is the battery system. Vehicle autonomy and, therefore, accurate detection of battery state of charge (SoC) together with battery expected life, i. e., battery state of health, are among the major drawbacks that prevent the introduction of electric vehicles in the consumer market. The electric scooter may provide the most feasible opportunity among EVs. They may be a replacement product for the primary-use vehicle, especially in Eu- rope and Asia, provided that drive performance, safety, and cost issues are similar to actual engine scooters. The battery system choice is a crucial item, and thanks to an increasing emphasis on vehicle range and performance, the Li-ion battery could become a viable candidate. This paper deals with the design of a battery pack based on Li-ion technology for a prototype electric scooter with high performance and autonomy. The adopted battery system is composed of a suitable number of cells series connected, featuring a high voltage level. Therefore, cell equalization and monitoring need to be provided. Due to manufacturing asymmetries, charge and discharge cycles lead to cell unbalancing, reducing battery capacity and, depending on cell type, causing safety troubles or strongly limiting the storage capacity of the full pack. No solution is available on the market at a cheap price, because of the required voltage level and performance, therefore, a dedicated battery management system was designed, that also includes a battery SoC monitoring.
