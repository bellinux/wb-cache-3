25|$|RCA {{inherited}} American Marconi's {{status as}} a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded Radiotron in the United States. Especially after the rise of broadcasting, they were a major profit source for the company. RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which {{were significantly higher than}} in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative products, ranging from <b>octal</b> <b>base</b> metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to miniaturized Nuvistor tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the cathode ray tube (CRT) picture tube.|$|E

The glass envelope of an <b>octal</b> <b>base</b> tube was cemented into a bakelite or plastic base with a hollow post in the center, surrounded by eight metal pins.

40|$|We present {{scalable}} {{and parallel}} versions of Lipmaa’s computationally-private information retrieval (CPIR) scheme [20], which provides log-squared communication complexity. In the proposed schemes, instead of binary decision diagrams utilized {{in the original}} CPIR, we employ an <b>octal</b> tree <b>based</b> approach, in which non-sink nodes have eight child nodes. Using octal trees offers two advantages: i) a serial implementation of the proposed scheme in software is faster than the original scheme and ii) its bandwidth usage becomes less than the original scheme {{when the number of}} items in the data set is moderately high (e. g., 4, 096 for 80 -bit security level using Damg°ard-Jurik cryptosystem). In addition, we present a highly-optimized parallel algorithm for shared-memory multi-core/processor architectures, which minimizes the number of synchronization points between the cores. We show that the parallel implementation is about 50 times faster than the serial implementation for a data set with 4, 096 items on an eight-core machine. Finally, we propose a hybrid algorithm that scales the CPIR scheme to larger data sets with small overhead in bandwidth complexity. We demonstrate that the hybrid scheme <b>based</b> on <b>octal</b> trees can lead to more than two orders of magnitude faster parallel implementations than serial implementations based on binary trees. Comparison with the original {{as well as the other}} schemes in the literature reveals that our scheme is the best in terms of bandwidth requirement...|$|R

40|$|Universal metric {{properties}} of the genetic code (i. e. RNA, DNA and protein coding) are defined {{by means of the}} nucleotide base representation on the square with vertices U or T = 00, C = 01, G = 10 and A = 11. It is shown that this notation defines the Canter set and Smale horseshoe map representation of the genetic code, the classic table arrangement and Siemion one-step mutation ring of the code. Gray code solutions to the problem of defining codon positions on the [0, 1] interval, and an extension to the <b>octal</b> coding system, <b>based</b> on the linear block triple check code, are given. This result enables short block (word) decoding of the genetic code patterns. The block code is related to the minimization of errors during transcription and translation processes, which implies that the genetic code is error-correcting and not degenerate. Two algorithms for the representation of codons on the [0, 1] interval and the related binary trees are discussed. It is concluded that the ternary Canter set algorithm is the method of choice for this type of analysis and coding. This procedure enables the analysis of the six dimensional hypercube codon positions by means of a simple time series and/or 'logistic' difference equation. Finally, a unified concept of the genetic code linked to the Canter set and horseshoe map is introduced {{in the form of a}} classic combinatorial 4 colour necklace model with three horizontal frames consisting of 64 coloured pearls (bases) and vertically hanging decorations of triplets (codons). Three horizontal necklace frames define Crick's code without comma, and vertical necklace decorations define the evolutional code. Thus, the type of the code depends on the level or direction of observation. The exact location of the mRNA and complementary DNA coding groups of triplets within a frame is determined. The latter enables decoding of long code block (language) patterns within the genetic code. This method of genetic code analysis is named Symbolic Canter Algorithm (SCA). The validity of the method was confirmed by 94 % accurate classification of 50 proteins of known secondary structure (25 alpha -helices and 25 beta -sheets) with the C 5. 0 machine learning system. Nucleotide strings of proteins transcribed by SCA were used for the analysis. Spectral Fourier analysis of Pro-opiomelanocortin and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 confirmed that the method might be also applied to the analysis of bioactive hormone and cytokine sequences...|$|R
