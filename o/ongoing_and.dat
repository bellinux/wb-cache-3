When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E

5|$|Brady {{was born}} on April 9, 1815, in New York City, the eldest son of Thomas S. Brady and his wife. Later, Brady would have seven siblings, two boys and five girls. The senior Brady had emigrated from Ireland to the United States while the War of 1812 was <b>ongoing,</b> <b>and</b> started a boys school in New York. When James was seven, he {{attended}} his father's school. In 1831 James's father had left teaching to become a lawyer, and he helped his father in his practice and in trials. In his father's office, James studied legal material tirelessly, and soon operated most of the firm's managerial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Due to the coyote's {{wide range}} and {{abundance}} throughout North America, it {{is listed as}} least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The coyote's pre-Columbian range {{was limited to the}} Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the United States and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. This expansion is <b>ongoing,</b> <b>and</b> the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} challenges for art historians {{in establishing the}} names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an <b>ongoing</b> <b>and</b> often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only {{as a result of}} decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century. Some painters, such as Adriaen Isenbrandt and Ambrosius Benson of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1942, German and Romanian forces began Operation Störfang, {{the final}} assault in the Siege of Sevastopol, which {{resulted}} in the city's capture on 4 July 1942. On the first day of this operation, Gollob claimed his 102nd victory, a LaGG-3 shot down over Sevastopol. The attack on Sevastopol was still making slow progress on 9 June, largely due to the artillery deployed within the fortress. Over the battle zone, Gollob claimed a I-153 shot down that day. Gollob did not claim any further victories until 18 June. The fighting over Sevastopol was still <b>ongoing</b> <b>and</b> Gollob claimed an Il-2 and a LaGG-3 over the southern sector of Sevastopol. These two victories took his total to 105. On 21 June 1942, Gollob was credited with two victories over LaGG-3 fighter aircraft. For this achievement, on 23 June, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, after his score had increased to 107 aerial victories. This was the 13th presentation of this award. On 1 July 1942, he was promoted to Major.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona III (November 22, 1861– May 23, 1917) was {{the last}} {{sovereign}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar. She ruled from July 30, 1883 to February 28, 1897 in a reign marked by <b>ongoing</b> <b>and</b> ultimately futile efforts to resist the colonial designs {{of the government of}} France. As a young woman, she was selected from among several Andriana qualified to succeed Queen Ranavalona II upon her death. Like both preceding queens, Ranavalona entered a political marriage with a member of the Hova elite named Rainilaiarivony, who in his role as Prime Minister of Madagascar, largely oversaw the day-to-day governance of the kingdom and managed its foreign affairs. Ranavalona tried to stave off colonization by strengthening trade and diplomatic relations with the United States and Great Britain throughout her reign. French attacks on coastal port towns and an assault on the capital city of Antananarivo ultimately led to the capture of the royal palace in 1895, ending the sovereignty and political autonomy of the century-old kingdom.|$|E
5|$|UND is {{classified}} by the Carnegie Foundation as a doctoral/research-intensive institution. This level of research activity {{is shown in}} UND's research statistics which, in fiscal year 2006, included program awards that reached $94.3 million, sponsored program expenditures that reached $81.2 million, and an overall research portfolio that included $315 million in total <b>ongoing</b> <b>and</b> committed accounts. Research activity at UND focuses on health sciences, nutrition, energy and environmental protection, aerospace, and engineering. As {{a major component of}} the Red River Valley Research Corridor, UND operates many research units including the Energy and Environmental Research Center, the School of Medicine, the Center for Rural Health, the Center for Innovation, the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium, the Bureau of Governmental Affairs, the Bureau of Educational Services and Applied Research, and the Social Science Research Institute. The Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), located on the eastern fringes of the UND campus, has been recognized as a leader in researching cleaner, more efficient forms of energy. The EERC operates a number of research units at UND including the National Center for Hydrogen Technology.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are <b>ongoing</b> <b>and</b> through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E
