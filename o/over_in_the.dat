5|$|During the off-season, Selwood was {{appointed}} {{as the national}} team captain of Australia for the 2014 International Rules Series against Ireland. Playing in the midfield, Selwood kicked one <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lone test match and led Australia to a 56-46 win against Ireland. In winning their 20th test match against Ireland, Australia reclaimed the Cormac McAnallen Trophy {{for the first time}} since 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} opener against Delaware, Steffy {{suffered}} an injured thumb, and Turner took <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter. He remained the starter {{for the rest of}} the season, and Steffy saw no further game action. Portis saw limited playing time throughout the season, usually being put in for a single option play at a time.|$|E
5|$|Mormons {{believe that}} the Star of Bethlehem was an actual astronomical event visible the world <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Book of Mormon, which they believe {{contains}} writings of ancient prophets, Samuel the Lamanite prophesies that a new star will appear {{as a sign that}} Jesus has been born, and Nephi later writes about the fulfillment of this prophecy.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} six deaths in {{incidents}} related to Patricia were reported in the state. Two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm's powerful winds. A woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident. Another four {{people were killed in}} an automobile accident in southern Jalisco. Two of the victims died in the wreckage and the other two died after being brought to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating at Wondecla, on the Atherton Tablelands {{in north}} Queensland, after an {{extended}} period of home leave during which time the Victorian and South Australian personnel took part in a march through Melbourne, the 2/5th Battalion spent the next year training on the Tablelands {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Division. There was also a large turn <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battalion's personnel at this time, as it had been severely depleted due to illness during its previous campaign, and it was brought up to strength by April 1944 with several drafts of reinforcements, with the majority coming from New South Wales. To counter boredom and malaise amongst the men during late 1944, the battalion was occupied with a series of various sporting events and further leave. In the new year, a series of amphibious exercises were undertaken during this time with a view to preparing the battalion for future operations.|$|E
5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying {{the foundation for a}} stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 194041, Miller was granted leave {{so that he could}} play interstate cricket. In a season {{shortened}} due to war, Miller played in three matches and scored 140 runs at 28.00. In the second match, which was against South Australia, Miller scored 63, his only fifty of the summer, and bowled {{for the first time at}} first-class level, conceding three runs from a solitary <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third match he took his maiden first-class wicket, in a war fundraising match for Stan McCabe's XI against Don Bradman's XI, that of Ken Ridings, caught behind with wicket-keeper Don Tallon. His pace was noticed by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality stucco flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was <b>over,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{linked with the}} manager's {{position}} at Bradford City on numerous previous occasions, and after Colin Todd was sacked on 12 February 2007, City chairman Julian Rhodes made McCall his number one target to take <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer. Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager {{for the rest of}} the 2006–07 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two—meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.|$|E
5|$|Illingworth took 4/92 in South Australia's first innings but was no-balled a {{total of}} three times by Egar and Ryan. Illingworth was called on each of the {{occasions}} by the umpire standing at square leg. He was called twice by Egar on the second and fourth deliveries of his eleventh over, and once by Ryan on the sixth ball of his fourteenth <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same fourteenth over, Illingworth had dismissed former Pakistani Test batsman Duncan Sharpe and Australian Test wicket-keeper Barry Jarman from the first and fourth deliveries respectively. This broke a 97-run stand between Sharpe and Ian Chappell, before Jarman was removed for a duck. After 17 more runs were added, Illingworth had Chappell caught behind for 127. South Australia eventually finished at 392.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 Walker {{signed with}} the Youngstown Phantoms of the junior United States Hockey League, moving to North America for the first time. He {{attended}} the training camp of the Washington Capitals in 2013 and {{signed with the}}ir AHL affiliate Hershey. Walker represents Australia internationally, and first played for them at the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division II tournament, where he helped his team win their group and earn a promotion to Division I for the following year. Passed <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous two NHL Entry Drafts, Walker was selected by the Capitals {{in the third round}} of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, the first Australian selected in an NHL draft. After several years in the AHL, Walker joined the Capitals in 2017, the first Australian to play in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|In the fifth-round match, {{the teams}} saw out a 0–0 draw at Maine Road, and the match was replayed at Anfield. Goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 2–1 lead, {{but the game}} {{finished}} in controversial circumstances when the referee blew his whistle for full time as Liverpool's Billy Liddell was bearing down on goal. Liddell put {{the ball in the}} net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road. Trailing 1–0 at half-time after a Jimmy Harris goal, City overcame the deficit in the second half with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1–0 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{the most}} {{economical}} Australian in the first innings of the game against Warwickshire. He took 3/29 from 22.3 overs as the hosts fell for 138, before making an unbeaten 13 at No. 9 as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. He was given a solitary maiden <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Johnson came to the crease at 6/202 after Bradman’s men had suffered a middle-order collapse of 3/8. He made 48 as the Australian lower order wagged to push the score to 321. Johnson was given a light bowling load in the first innings, sending down only five overs, but he removed three of the last four wickets to end with 3/5 as the hosts fell for 130. He did not bat in the second innings and took 1/30 as the home side managed to hang on with seven wickets down. In the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Johnson came in at 7/212 and made 44 to help Australia recover to 282 and took 1/2 from three overs as the hosts reached 5/73 when rain ended the match after the first day.|$|E

5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 when the Federal government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the church's history after its construction. The {{building}} survived until the 11th century, after which it fell into decay, while several architectural elements were removed and reused in Constantinople and other cities. After being built <b>over</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman period, {{the site of the}} church was rediscovered during excavations in the 1960s. The area, directly opposite the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality City Hall, is now a preserved archaeological site open to visitors, although the sculptures have been removed to the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.|$|E
