5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed in regards to their <b>own</b> <b>minds.</b> According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed. Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in prison, or both. This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers. On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their <b>own</b> <b>minds</b> and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E

25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their <b>own</b> <b>minds</b> and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the bill}} cited recent polling that 70% of Canadians {{supported}} capital punishment and called on the government to call a national referendum on the issue. Other opponents accused Allmand and Trudeau of proposing the bill now {{so that it would}} not expire before the next federal election in 1979 and risk costing the Liberals votes. Almost all opponents though, thought that the death penalty was a useful tool to deter crime and terrorism. Former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker argued that after the Munich massacre, passing Bill C-84 was sending the wrong message in the lead-up to the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. In response to the calls for referendum, including a motion for a national plebiscite by Alberta MP Gordon Towers, Allmand argued that the role of MPs was to deliberate in the House of Commons, make up their <b>own</b> <b>minds,</b> and then vote. He also argued that representative democracy necessarily excluded plebiscites, because then it would open the door to plebiscites on a variety of serious and controversial issues.|$|E

25|$|Beyond sex {{differences}} in academic ability, recent research has also been focusing on women’s underrepresentation in higher education, especially {{in the fields of}} natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Nonetheless, 2011 data on earned doctorates in the United States by the National Science Foundation shows female representation in all of academia varies, not just in STEM subjects. For example, in 2011, women earned 54% of molecular biology PhDs but less than 20% in physics (STEM). In humanities and social sciences, women earned over 70% of psychology PhDs, but only 30% in philosophy. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Women in Science explained these patterns of female under-representation across academic disciplines, using the field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis, which claims that women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not possessing such talent. The study, conducted on 1820 academics from 30 different disciplines, found that the more a particular field values gifted-ness, the fewer the female PhDs in that discipline. According to the researchers, “emphasis on raw aptitude may activate negative stereotypes in women’s <b>own</b> <b>minds,</b> making them vulnerable to stereotype threat”.|$|E

It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Frank and Roo {{decide to}} get married because she is pregnant. Downing said that the serial was {{approaching}} sex before marriage in a liberal way. The writers dealt with it [...] "sensibly" [...] because Frank and Roo make up their <b>own</b> <b>minds.</b> She added {{that it was important}} to let teenagers show their maturity if they want to marry. Roo keeps her baby's paternity a secret until the wedding day. In the middle of exchanging vows, Roo decides to be honest and tells Frank the truth. A wedding scenario had been planned for Roo, by the serial's writing team from the off-set. Bateman said that the wedding was not just to attract more viewers. He opined that people think that weddings were always based on the [...] "consummation of love". Roo and Frank's wedding highlighted that it does not always work that way. The wedding episode resulted in a ratings boost and heightened media interest for Home and Away. Magazines and newspapers labelled it as a [...] "shotgun wedding". Frank and Roo's wedding storyline was also covered by TV Week as their main story. Papps and Clarke were the first ever Home and Away cast members to feature on the cover of the magazine. Papps told J Clayden that Frank would never get over Roo lies about the baby's father. When Frank learns the truth, he leaves Roo at the altar. He then crashes his car and which leaves Frank in a coma.|$|E

[...] The most obvious concern involves privacy.

[...] However, as technology has improved, computers have {{become more and more}} human-like, and these boundaries had to be redrawn. [...] People now compare their <b>own</b> <b>minds</b> to machines, and talk to them freely without any shame or embarrassment.

5000|$|Solipsism ( [...] ; [...] ) is the {{philosophical}} idea that only one's <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> {{is sure to}} exist.
