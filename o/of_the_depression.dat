5|$|By September 28, the {{organization}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear. The center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated {{a decrease in}} wind shear over the depression within two days, thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear exposed the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, the remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco.

5|$|Convection {{began to}} {{increase}} on July 6, {{supported on the}} basis that many showers were observed to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression.</b> An anticyclone—a large mass of air rotating clockwise—intensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds {{to the north of the}} center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression.</b> The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7, and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg). Cindy began to curve westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and drifted due west early on July 8 as a result of a maturing surface high to its north. Steady intensification continued throughout the day, and the storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.|$|E
5|$|Early on May29, Tropical Depression One nearly {{attained}} {{tropical storm}} status, with intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reaching T2.5, or 40mph (65km/h); however, the estimates were also {{as low as}} T1.5, leading to the intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> remaining at 35mph (55km/h). After a burst in convective activity overnight, shower and thunderstorm activity waned once more by 0700UTC. Situated {{at the edge of}} the Gulf Stream, intensification into a tropical storm was no longer anticipated. Later that morning, the center of circulation became fully exposed by strong wind shear; an approaching trough also began absorbing the small depression by this time. The remaining convection associated with the system was displaced to the southeast. With no convection developing around the depression, it degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area during the afternoon of May29. At 2100UTC, the NHC issued their final advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> persisted until 0600UTC on May30, at which time it was absorbed by a warm front south of Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was in an area not favorable for significant strengthening, due to land interaction and wind shear. It was tracking steadily northeastward, and as it {{moved closer to the}} coastline, the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> was difficult to locate. However, the overall organization briefly improved, and in one forecast the depression was predicted to attain tropical storm status. Early on June4, convection weakened significantly, leaving the center partially exposed. Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> remained just offshore. Late on June4, the circulation accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco. Early on June5, the circulation dissipated, and later that night the remnants moved inland.|$|E
5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In the early stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{slowdown}} of {{the economy}} at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Depression,</b> the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E
