40|$|Many reports {{evaluating}} ligand-based virtual {{screening methods}} {{show that the}} results are strongly dependent on {{the composition of the}} employed benchmark datasets. Recently, it became apparent, that two causes for overop-timistic validation results need to be avoided: artificial enrichment and analogue bias. Artificial enrichment is observed when the decoy set (i. e. the background) differs significantly from the set <b>of</b> <b>actives</b> regarding "simple" molecular properties. Analogue bias describes {{the fact that in the}} dataset <b>of</b> <b>actives</b> certain scaffolds are over-repre-sented. Both phenomena render retrieval <b>of</b> <b>actives</b> trivial. Several techniques were proposed in the literature to cope with these problems. Most of them use the mean of pair wise distances or the mean of pair wise similarity coeffi-cients to characterize dataset diversity [1]. It is obviou...|$|R

40|$|With DEKOIS we {{have created}} an {{automated}} workflow to efficiently generate decoy sets based on a certain num-ber <b>of</b> <b>actives</b> for any target [1]. Physico-chemical similar-ity should be maximized between decoys and actives in order to yield challenging sets for benchmarking, while exact mimicking <b>of</b> potentially <b>active</b> substructures should be avoided to omit latent actives in the decoy set (LADS). Overall, the diversity <b>of</b> <b>actives</b> and decoys should be maximized to avoid artifacts based on clusters. Applying this philosophy, we have added more details to describe the physicochemical space and applied this pro-tocol to generate sets for targets which had not been accessible before.

40|$|Encapsulation <b>of</b> <b>actives</b> in {{miniature}} reservoirs, called microcapsules, {{is used for}} protection and in particular controlled release <b>of</b> the <b>active.</b> Regarding controlled release applications, the most common function of the microcapsule is to sustain or extend the release <b>of</b> the <b>active.</b> A number <b>of</b> encapsulation methodologies are available including; internal phase separation, interfacial polymerization, formation of multiple emulsions, Layer-by-Layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes and soft templating techniques, {{all of which are}} reviewed in this Perspective. The choice of method depends on the nature <b>of</b> the <b>active</b> (hydrophilic/hydrophobic, size, physical state) and on the intended release rate and release profile. Ways to manipulate the release <b>of</b> the <b>active</b> by tailoring the physicochemical properties of the microcapsule are reviewed.

5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods <b>of</b> <b>active</b> disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes <b>of</b> <b>active</b> disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
