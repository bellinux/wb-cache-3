5|$|Convicted {{prisoners were}} refused {{the same rights}} as internees until July 1972, when Special Category Status was {{introduced}} following a hunger strike by 40 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, <b>or</b> <b>political,</b> status meant prisoners were treated similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions <b>or</b> <b>political</b> and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1879-1880, {{extended}} periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands. Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the Vereeniging voor Armenzorg (Association {{to care for the}} poor), helping regardless of religious <b>or</b> <b>political</b> beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a Wintersnood-Commissie, which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP events may be designed for educational <b>or</b> <b>political</b> purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing scenario {{in which they are}} forced to improvise speech or writing in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E
5|$|Pussy Riot's {{performances}} {{can either}} be called dissident art <b>or</b> <b>political</b> action that engages art forms.

5|$|Romney {{released}} his book, , in March 2010, and undertook an 18-state book tour {{to promote the}} work.

It debuted atop The New York Times Best Seller list. Romney donated his earnings from the book to charity.|$|E

5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, <b>or</b> <b>political</b> concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade {{began in}} 1979, {{and has been}} held every year. In 2007, the parade {{attracted}} wider attention when parade organizers approved {{the inclusion of a}} group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial <b>or</b> <b>political</b> issues, and that the initial approval was an error.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this position is that the thugs win and people have more incentive to be thugs. There {{are lots of people}} out there who would very much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious <b>or</b> <b>political.</b> The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.|$|E
5000|$|Punishment - While the {{classical}} totalitarian regimes punished harshly (imprisoning <b>or</b> killing <b>political</b> <b>or</b> ideological opponents and scapegoats), inverted totalitarianism in particular punishes {{by means of}} an economy of fear (minimizing social security, [...] busting unions, outdating skills, outsourcing jobs, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|While the {{official}} reason of a PASSEX is to practice cooperation, various unofficial reasons {{might be to}} [...] "show the flag" [...] (show {{the power of a}} nation through a public display of naval power) <b>or</b> other <b>political</b> <b>or</b> diplomatic reasons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{of a police}} state may experience restrictions on their mobility, or on their freedom to express <b>or</b> communicate <b>political</b> <b>or</b> other views, which are subject to police monitoring <b>or</b> enforcement. <b>Political</b> control may be exerted {{by means of a}} secret police force that operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional state. Robert von Mohl, who first introduced the rule of law to German jurisprudence, contrasted the Rechtsstaat ("legal" [...] or [...] "constitutional" [...] state) with the anti-aristocratic Polizeistaat ("police state").|$|R
5|$|The earlier {{theories}} of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff {{said that the}} Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic <b>or</b> <b>political</b> in origin. If he was {{held responsible for the}} putative misery in the past, this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{marked the}} end of the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies, except for Netherlands New Guinea. It also significantly changed ethnic castes, as well as reducing the power of many of the local rulers (raja). It did not significantly improve the economic <b>or</b> <b>political</b> fortune {{of the majority of the}} population, although a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Clinton became {{president}} in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust {{to avoid the}} possibility of ethical conflicts <b>or</b> <b>political</b> embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race.

5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious <b>or</b> <b>political</b> reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|Banquets {{have been}} a venue for {{entertainment}} since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes to impress visitors, especially important ones (4, 6, 9); to show hospitality (2, 4, 8); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both (2, 3). They were {{an integral part of}} court entertainments (3, 4) and helped entertainers develop their skills (2, 3). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations (9), weddings (7), birthdays (10) civic <b>or</b> <b>political</b> achievements (5), military engagements or victories (6) as well as religious obligations (1). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants (10) and combined with a performance in dinner theatres. Cooking by professional chefs has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the Bocuse d'Or.|$|E
5|$|Camp {{guards were}} members of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (Death's Head Units). Around 7,000 SS {{personnel}} in total were posted to Auschwitz during the war. Of these, 4 percent of SS personnel were officers and 26 percent were non-commissioned officers, while the remainder were rank-and-file members. Approximately three in four SS personnel worked in security. Others worked in the medical <b>or</b> <b>political</b> departments, in the camp headquarters, or in the economic administration, which was responsible for the property of dead prisoners. SS personnel at the camp included 200 women, who worked as guards, nurses, or messengers. The overall command authority for the entire camp was Department D (the Concentration Camps Inspectorate) of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS Economics Main Office; SS-WVHA).|$|E
