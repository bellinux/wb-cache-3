5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey.

Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E

5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious <b>ones,</b> <b>and</b> his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|Even though Kern {{intended}} for the character's morality to be left ambiguous and to the viewer's interpretation, a majority of television commentators characterized Christy as an antagonist. Brittany Spanos of Vulture.com determined that Christy was an evil witch due to her betrayal of Billie and the Charmed <b>Ones,</b> <b>and</b> SpoilerTV's Gavin Hetherington identified her as the season's big bad. In their book The Book of Three, authors Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis wrote that she served as the Triad's protégée. Ruditis followed this up in a later interview by calling Christy a pawn {{under the control of}} the Triad rather than a proper villain; he found that the series lacked a strong, female antagonist.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new {{series for the}} Big Three television networks.

While {{a majority of the}} series was animated, live-action segments involving actual animals were also included to separate different scenes in an episode. According to Scheimer, filming with the animals was tough, as the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase the cats on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E

5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational <b>ones</b> <b>and</b> are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E
