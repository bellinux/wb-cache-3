25|$|The second match saw Agnieszka Radwańska {{trying to}} advance to the semifinals taking on Petra Kvitová. With Kvitová, Victoria Azarenka and Samantha Stosur already through, Radwańska had to take a set from Kvitová <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>to</b> become the fourth player into the final four. And that goal didn't seem far away at all as she stormed out to a 5–1 first set lead - but Kvitová {{suddenly}} came alive, her power game hitting its mark as she stormed back to take the opening set comfortably in a tie-break. Although there were a few close moments midway through the second set - she went to six deuces before holding in a marathon game for 4–3 - Kvitová never really looked in trouble again, eventually finishing the match off with a big crosscourt forehand that drew one last backhand error from Radwańska. Whether she was winning or losing, Kvitová seemed to be in complete control of the score against Radwańska - she finished the match with 42 winners to 47 unforced errors, while Radwańska had eight winners to 17 unforced errors. Kvitová finished first in the Red Group with a bullet, 3–0 in win-loss and 6–0 in sets. Although Zvonareva, Radwańska and Caroline Wozniacki all ended with a 1–2 win–loss record and 3–5 sets won-lost, Zvonareva had the best games won-lost percentage of the three and thus finished second in the Red Group. The semifinals will be Red Group No.1 Kvitová taking on White Group No.2 Stosur, and White Group No.1 Azarenka taking on Red Group No.2 Zvonareva.|$|E

Judging resumes, and the results are announced. Either the Challenging team wins, or the Iron Chef wins in overall score, and the best dish from the challenging team is also announced.

2500|$|Baseball fans in Lancaster waited 44 {{years for}} the sport to return after the Lancaster Red Roses folded {{following}} the 1961 season. In 2003, Lancastrians chose the name [...] "Barnstormers" [...] in a team-sponsored fan ballot. The name refers to the act of [...] "barnstorming", which means to travel around an area appearing in exhibition sports events, especially baseball games. It was used to describe Lancaster's baseball teams {{as far back as}} 1906 by the Lancaster Daily Intelligencer: [...] "There was a crowd of between seven and eight hundred persons out <b>on</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>to</b> see the Lancaster barnstormers play the Philadelphia Giants." [...] The team's primary logo was designed with local history in mind, as the team's original colors of red, navy blue, and khaki were the same as those used by the former Red Roses. The name and logo also allude to Lancaster County's agricultural heritage, notable for its inclusion of Amish culture and lore. The Barnstormers organization lightheartedly calls its market the [...] "Pennsylvania Clutch Country," [...] referring to Lancaster's location in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country and the sports term, [...] "clutch". The Barnstormers represent all of Lancaster County, even though they play in the city of Lancaster. The team designates many of its home games to honor the county's smaller communities.|$|E
2500|$|Notwithstanding {{the changes}} brought {{about in the}} course of time, Vespers still remains the great and {{important}} Office of the evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the sacrificium vespertinum of the Old Law. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the Office of the Vigil, so also {{is the end of the}} day by Vespers. It terminates, as Matins formerly terminated, and Lauds at present terminates, by a lection, or reading, from the Gospel, or canticum evangelii, which, for Vespers, is always the [...] "Magnificat". This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers, one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as in some liturgies the [...] "Magnificat" [...] is sung at Lauds (cf. Cabrol in [...] "Dict. d'arch. et de liturgie", s.v. Cantiques évangéliques). This place of honour accorded so persistently to the canticle of Mary from such remote antiquity is but one of the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Church. The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss. cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl, belong invariably to Lauds. The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the Roman Breviary also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the symbolism of this hour. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular characteristic—they are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the Creation, according to the day of the week, thus: the first, [...] "Lucis Creator optime", on Sunday, to the creation of light; the second, on Monday, to the separation of the earth and the waters; the third, on Tuesday, to the creation of the plants; the fourth, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon; the fifth, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; the sixth, <b>on</b> <b>Friday,</b> <b>to</b> the creation of the beasts of the earth; Saturday is an exception, the hymn on that day being in honour of the Blessed Trinity, because of the Office of Sunday then commencing.|$|E
