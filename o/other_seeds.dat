5|$|The winter diet {{is mainly}} plant {{material}} including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants, but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and <b>other</b> <b>seeds</b> in fields, though less frequently than other Anas ducks. During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly invertebrate animals, including aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and <b>other</b> <b>seeds</b> in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent or fish. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and <b>other</b> <b>seeds.</b> As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>seeds,</b> such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and <b>other</b> <b>seeds.</b> The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} the seed coat. However, {{the nature of the}} seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. <b>Other</b> <b>seeds</b> can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.|$|E
25|$|Both extant {{species are}} found at heights of between 1500 and 3000m asl in Mexico in {{isolated}} island-like forest habitats in the Sierra Madre, and are sometimes called snow parrots {{because of their}} high-altitude habitat. They show seasonal migration patterns, generally breeding in the northern parts of their range and overwintering in the southern. The thick-billed parrot nests in tree cavities, while the maroon-fronted parrot is a cliff cavity breeder. The parrots roost at night in large flocks, while they forage during the day in smaller flocks over a large area. They feed primarily on pine seeds, which they extract by systematically stripping the cones from the base to the top. They also eat <b>other</b> <b>seeds</b> such as acorns, as well as softer foods such as fruits, bark, nectar, other vegetable matter, and insects.|$|E

25|$|The Miwok Native American tribe {{settled the}} area around the Cosumnes River Preserve many centuries ago. They survived up through the 1900s with a 1910 census {{counting}} 670 Miwok Native Americans left. According to a 1770 estimate, there were approximately 9000 Miwok present. Population density for the Miwok tribe was about 10 persons per square mile which may have been the most out of any California tribe. The entire Miwok tribe consisted of 28 small groups which could range from 300 to 475 people. The Miwok people ate a diet consisting of acorns, various types of <b>other</b> <b>seeds,</b> deer, and fish. The local Miwok people practiced burning and other management practices to shape the land to create more opportunity for food. Through these methods of enhancing floodplains in the area, fish species may have had lower mortality rates and increased growth. After the mid 1700s, the Miwok way of life started to change {{with the arrival of the}} Spanish.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. <b>Other</b> <b>seeds</b> may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E
500|$|The skull {{roof of the}} subfossil cranium was flattened, {{indicating}} the Cuban macaw fed on hard seeds, especially from palms. [...] This {{is consistent with the}} habits of their large relatives on mainland South America and distinct from those of smaller, mainly frugivorous relatives. In 1876, Gundlach wrote that the Cuban macaw ate fruits, seeds of the royal palm (Roystonea regia) and the chinaberry tree (Melia azedarach), as well as <b>other</b> <b>seeds</b> and shoots. Cuba has many species of palms, and those found in swamps were probably most important to the Cuban macaw. The pulp surrounding the seeds of the chinaberry tree were probably the part consumed by the Cuban macaw.|$|E

50|$|Castor oil is {{well known}} {{as a source of}} ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Among fatty acids, ricinoleic acid is unusual in that it has a {{hydroxyl}} functional group on the 12th carbon. This functional group causes ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) to be more polar than most fats. The chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most <b>other</b> <b>seed</b> oils. Because of its ricinoleic acid content, castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks, commanding a higher price than <b>other</b> <b>seed</b> oils. As an example, in July 2007, Indian castor oil sold for about US$0.90 per kilogram (US$0.41 per pound) whereas U.S. soybean, sunflower and canola oils sold for about US$0.30 per kilogram (US$0.14 per pound).|$|R

500|$|Yosemite Valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} for nearly 3,000 years, though humans may have first visited {{the area as}} long as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. The indigenous natives called themselves the Ahwahneechee, meaning [...] "dwellers in Ahwahnee." [...] They {{are related to the}} Northern Paiute and Mono tribes. Many tribes visited the area to trade, including nearby Central Sierra Miwoks, who lived along the drainage area of the Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers. A major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake, just to the east of the Yosemite area. Vegetation and game in the region were similar to that present today; acorns were a staple to their diet, as well as <b>other</b> <b>seeds</b> and plants, salmon and deer.|$|E
500|$|Although red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} feed on a {{wide variety}} of native and introduced grains, the mainstay of their diet is eucalyptus seeds. There is a specific relationship between the species and larger-fruited species of gums. These vary across Australia but include the marri in Southwest Western Australia, Darwin woolybutt E. miniata across the north of the country, E. baxteri in Victoria and the bloodwood species Corymbia polycarpa and C. intermedia in Queensland. Cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules, then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering the ground with debris. Among <b>other</b> <b>seeds</b> and nuts consumed are those of Acacia, Allocasuarina, Banksia, Grevillea and Hakea, as well as berries, fruits and various insects. Cockatoos have adapted to eating some introduced plants such as the doublegee (Emex australis). There is some evidence of consumption of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), wild turnip (Brassica tournefortii) and melon (Citrullus or Cucumis). Red-tailed black cockatoos have been implicated as agricultural pests of peanut and other crops at Lakeland Downs in Far North Queensland. [...] Here the cockatoos, in flocks of up to several hundred birds, have learned to sever the peanut plants above ground level before pulling the peanuts out of the ground by their stems and shelling them. [...] They also damage electrical cables on pivot irrigators.|$|E
