50|$|Ironically, {{it is not}} the {{complexity}} of the new function or any new system characteristics that are the root of large project failures - it is our understanding and communication of the overall requirement (as identified in The Mythical Man Month). To succeed the requirements need to include a precise and thorough understanding of the constraints of the existing business and IT. Current “Greenfield” tooling and methods use early, informal and often imprecise abstractions that essentially ignore such complexity. Early, poorly informed abstractions are usually wrong and are often detected late in construction, resulting in delays, expensive rework and even failed developments. A Brownfield oriented approach embraces existing complexity, and is used to reliably accelerate the <b>overall</b> <b>solution</b> engineering process, including enabling phased, incremental change wherever possible.|$|E
