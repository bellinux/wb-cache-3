5|$|In 1919, M-69 {{started at}} the state line south <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Falls. It ran north through Crystal Falls, where it intersected M-12, to end in Covington at an {{intersection}} with M-28. This roadway was redesignated {{with the creation of}} the U.S. Highway System in 1926. US2 replaced M-69 south and M-12 west <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Falls. US102 replaced M-69 north <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Falls, and the latter designation was reused on the section of M-12 east of town. Where the roadway intersected M-45 (now M-95) in Sagola, M-69 joined it to Randville and then replaced M-90 east to Foster City by 1927. By 1930, the highway was extended through Menominee County into Delta County to end at an intersection with US2/US41 east of Bark River. This extension gave M-69 its current routing.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> flaws is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} quality of a diamond.

High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers {{spent much time}} on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Tools entered {{development}} in August 2005 under the code name White Engine. It {{was intended for}} the then PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII. The decision to expand Crystal Tools' compatibility to other game projects and systems marked the official project start for a company-wide engine. Development {{was carried out by}} the Research and Development Division headed by Taku Murata, which was specifically established for this purpose. As Square Enix's biggest project to date, the creation <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Tools caused substantial problems in the simultaneous production of several flagship titles; various critics cited the engine as the primary cause of significant delays in the release of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools {{is a game}} engine {{created and}} used {{internally}} by the Japanese company Square Enix. It combines standard libraries for elements such as graphics, sound and artificial intelligence while providing game developers with various authoring tools. The target systems <b>of</b> <b>Crystal</b> Tools are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. This was decided {{with the intention of}} making cross-platform production more feasible. The idea for the engine sprang from Square Enix's desire to have a unified game development environment in order to effectively share the technology and know-how of the company's individual teams.|$|E
40|$|Part of the {{challenge}} <b>of</b> macromolecular <b>crystal</b> growth for structure determination is obtaining an appropriate number <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> with a crystal volume suitable for X-ray analysis. In this respect {{an understanding of the}} effect of solution conditions on macromolecule nucleation rates is advantageous. This study investigated the effects of solution conditions on the nucleation rate and final <b>crystal</b> size <b>of</b> two <b>crystal</b> systems; tetragonal lysozyme and glucose isomerase. Batch crystallization plates were prepared at given solution concentration and incubated at set temperatures over one week. The number <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> per well with their size and axial ratios were recorded and correlated with solution conditions. Duplicate experiments indicate the reproducibility of the technique. Results for each system showing the effect of supersaturation, incubation temperature and solution pH on nucleation rates will be presented and discussed. In the case of lysozyme, having optimized solution conditions to produce an appropriate number <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> <b>of</b> a suitable size, a batch <b>of</b> <b>crystals</b> were prepared under exactly the same conditions. Fifty <b>of</b> these <b>crystals</b> were analyzed by x-ray techniques. The results indicate that even under the same crystallization conditions, a marked variation in crystal properties exists...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
