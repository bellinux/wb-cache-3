25|$|The post-Mao Zedong Chinese Communist Party {{leadership}} viewed {{education as}} the foundation of the Four Modernizations. In the early 1980s, science and technology education became an important focus of education policy. By 1986 training skilled personnel and expanding scientific and technical knowledge had been assigned the highest priority. Although the humanities were considered important, vocational and technical skills were considered paramount for meeting China's modernization goals. The reorientation of educational priorities paralleled Deng Xiaoping's strategy for economic development. Emphasis also was placed on the further training of the already-educated elite, who would carry on the modernization program in the coming decades. Renewed emphasis on modern science and technology led to the adoption, beginning in 1976, of an <b>outward-looking</b> <b>policy</b> that encouraged learning and borrowing from abroad for advanced training {{in a wide range of}} scientific fields.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} makes {{an attempt to}} {{identify}} factors that play {{important role in the}} export competitiveness of Indian manufacturing firms with particular emphasis on knowledgebased industries. The study finds that younger firms drive export competitiveness in the high technology and low technology sub-samples of Indian manufacturing whereas in the medium technology older firms are more competitive. Firm size is observed to have a non-linear impact on export performance largely represented by an inverted U-shape curve. It is also found that the firm’s own innovative activities are by far the most important technological factor contributing to the enhanced competitiveness whereas the import of foreign technology through technology contracts found to have detrimental effects on the export competitiveness in high technology and medium-high technology segments of Indian manufacturing. Access to foreign raw materials and inputs is also observed to be a critical factor for export success of Indian firms across technology segments. Another important variable {{that can be used to}} increase export competitiveness in high technology and low technology industries is encouraging Indian firms to establish subsidiaries abroad. Foreign affiliates in Indian manufacturing are found to achieve higher export success than domestic firms. The <b>outward-looking</b> <b>policy</b> initiated sinc...|$|E

Some joint effects of an openness policy and of structural vulnerability are then presented, relying on several previous cross-section regressions and summarized on six proposals : 1 / whereas economic growth is raised by export growth, it is lowered by export instability, 2 / vulnerability (instability) affects more total factor productivity than capital accumulation, 3 / structural vulnerability to a large extent operates through economic policy intermediary variables, 4 / negative effects of export instability are dampened by an open policy, 5 / they are also dampened by foreign aid, 6 / an appropriate measurement of macroeconomic performance both reflecting the quality (openness) of the policy and taking into account structural vulnerability, {{can be used as a}} criterion for aid allocation. aid., growth, resilience, productivity, instability, shocks, <b>outward-looking</b> <b>policy,</b> vulnerability, Openness...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of trade openness on economic growth via budget balance is surprisingly neglected in the literature, {{particularly since the}} theoretical and empirical studies have provided a positive and robust relationship between budget balance and economic growth. In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical explanations about the way that trade openness influences budget balance by distinguishing the effects of natural openness from those of trade policy. The panel data analysis focuses on 66 developing countries for which we have the required data. We find that, theoretically and empirically, the effects of trade openness on budget balance through {{its effect on the}} instability of government revenue is quite clear: trade openness increases a country's exposure to external shocks (whether it is due to natural openness or to trade policy). This enforces the negative impacts of the instability of term of trade on budget balance. We also find that trade openness affects budget balance through many others channels (corruption, inequalities, etc). In this case, the additional effects on budget position of natural openness and trade policy are opposed: trade policy seems enhance budget surpluses, on the contrary, natural openness seems deteriorate budget deficits. panel data analysis., developing countries, Instability of term of trade, budget deficits, natural openness, <b>outward-looking</b> <b>policy,</b> trade openness...|$|E

40|$|After the Great Depression of 1929 [...] 1933, the {{relative}} isolation of Mexico's economy {{led to the}} adoption of Import Substitution Industrialization. The use of this model as a development strategy meant specializing in manufactured goods under a regime of state interventionism and a closed economy. However, after many years of inward-looking policies, ISI collapsed. Moreover, with excessive public expenditures and fiscal mismanagements, Mexico's economic stability started to erode. The result was Mexico's first economic crisis, the effects of which could only be alleviated through loans from International Financial Institutions that were contingent on the implementation of defined policies. Thus, Mexico adopted the neoliberal development model as its strategy for economic growth and recovery. Under this model, trade liberalization, <b>outward-looking</b> <b>policies,</b> and state non-interventionism promised economic growth as a necessary precondition for social justice and development.

40|$|Throughout the world, {{the goal}} of liberalized trade has become the norm rather than the exception. In country after country, {{successful}} policy reforms of the 1980 s and 1990 s have added weight to the evidence linking outward orientation and economic growth. China’s emergence as a major exporter has demonstrated beyond a doubt that the benefits from integration into global markets apply to large countries as well as small ones. In the 1990 s even such notable laggards as Brazil and India have begun to dismantle policies that for decades insulated their economies from foreign competition. Today the key question for policy makers is less whether to pursue an outward-oriented policy than how to achieve and sustain the required policy environment. This paper identifies obstacles to trade liberalization and looks at ways successful liberalizers are able to overcome them. The focus is on trade reform as an ongoing process, including the packaging of reform measures, their timing and sequencing, and the political-economy issues central to the viability of reforms in progress.

40|$|The social, {{economic}} and environmental impacts of large-scale retail outlets on existing retail and urban systems have been extensively discussed in the planning literature. This article documents {{the last two decades}} of transformation in Turkey's retail sector, which have been characterized by a more organized development of the sector than traditionally existed. We begin our analysis with the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, when more-liberal and <b>outward-looking</b> <b>policies</b> began to emerge in Turkish economic policy. Changes in the economy and related legislation prepared a base for the subsequent transformations of that decade, culminating, especially in large cities, in the development of shopping malls as alternative retail spaces to traditional markets and stores on a shopping street. We believe that the Turkish case reveals specific aspects of resistance, adaptation and change, and thus needs a detailed account. After providing a general picture of retailing and its transformation in Turkey, we provide empirical evidence from Ankara, the capital city, through which all important dynamics of retailing are exemplified. To this end, we ask the following questions: What are the evolving processes behind the existing location patterns of shopping centres in Ankara? What is the extent of the change in definition of the new public realm? How do street retailers survive? Who are the actors and what are their approaches towards retail planning in Turkey? The answers to these questions may provide implications for urban policy and retail planning in Turkey. The case may also be interesting for countries experiencing similar patterns of change and development, that is, where the globalization process in retailing and consumption-related sites began later than in other countries and observed fast-paced development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In recent times, {{literature}} - favouring a neo-classical perspective - on industrialization {{in developing}} nations has been the subnect of increasing criticism. The opponents of the neo-classical approach argue that <b>outward-looking</b> free market <b>policies</b> do not offer the best prospects for self-sustaining growth. In a straight forward manner, Chapter 1 airs the views of economists of both perspectives. Subsequently, a framework for a general discussion is provided. <b>Outward-looking</b> industrial <b>policies</b> m Ireland, {{have led to the}} emergence of a vibrant foreign-owned manufacturing sector. As Chapter 2 points out, there is considerable evidence that outward-looking industrialization has thus far been unsuccessful in developing strong native companies capable of entering export markets. Chapter 3 suggests that this may be a common experience among late industrializing countries (LICs). In fact, the creation of a competitive indigenous manufacturing base may be contingent upon a departure from strict neo-classical guidelines. Chapter 4 shows that the development of the motor industry in LICs has usually taken place under the auspices of large transnational corporations (TNCs) from developed countries. Only with active state intervention have domestic firms - with the assistance of foreign capital and technology - shown an ability to compete on the world market. As Chapter 5 indicates, assembly of motor vehicles in Ireland was dominated by the subsidiaries of foreign companies. This is also true of the Irish automotive components sector, which has evolved in recent years. The analysis of this sector, contained m Chapter 5, is based largely on unpublished material. It is clear that this industry suffers from many of the short-comings often associated with foreign dominated sectors of Irish manufacturing. By way of a conclusion, Chapter 6 argues that a role exists for more state intervention. However, it warns that government intervention in the system is not without risk. The task facing policy makers is to design a constructive role for the state. With respect to the Irish manufacturing industry, m the absence of more state intervention, the development of export markets will remain beyond the reach of most indigenous producers...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, when many {{developing}} countries experienced severe economic difficulties because of excessive market regulation and trade protection, {{a number of them}} have initiated extensive policy reforms These reforms have been designed to free up markets and to move these countries in a more outward-oriented direction.

This should lead to increased growth of GDP not only because of static economic gains associated with the exploitation of comparative advantage and economies of scale but also because of a number of dynamic ways in which trade contributes to economic growth.

50|$|In 1960, at the {{initiation}} of Salazar's more <b>outward-looking</b> economic <b>policy</b> due {{to the influence of}} a new generation of technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent, and by 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. On a long term analysis, after an extended period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic (1910-1926), the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1960, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960-1973 under the Estado Novo regime (and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against independence guerrilla groups from 1961 onwards) created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism, and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy brought new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams. The economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new capital equipment and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable consumer goods. The Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates. Economically, the Estado Novo regime maintained a policy of corporatism that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates, including those founded by the families of António Champalimaud (Banco Totta & Açores, Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor, Secil, Cimpor), José Manuel de Mello (CUF - Companhia União Fabril), Américo Amorim (Corticeira Amorim) and the dos Santos family (Jerónimo Martins). Those Portuguese conglomerates had a business model with similarities to South Korean chaebols and Japanese keiretsus and zaibatsus. The Companhia União Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese conglomerates with its core businesses (cement, chemicals, petrochemicals, agrochemicals, textiles, beer, beverages, metallurgy, naval engineering, electrical engineering, insurance, banking, paper, tourism, mining, etc.) and corporate headquarters located in mainland Portugal, but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the Portuguese Empire, specially in the Portuguese territories of Angola and Mozambique. Other medium-sized family companies specialized in textiles (for instance those located in the city of Covilhã and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (like those of Alcobaça, Caldas da Rainha and Marinha Grande), engineered wood (like SONAE near Porto), canned fish (like those of Algarve and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (alcoholic beverages, from liqueurs like Licor Beirão and Ginjinha, to beer like Sagres, were produced across the entire country, but Port Wine was one of its most reputed and exported alcoholic beverages), tourism (well established in Estoril/Cascais/Sintra and growing as an international attraction in the Algarve since the 1960s) and in agriculture (like the ones scattered around the Alentejo - known as the breadbasket of Portugal) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early 1970s. In addition, rural areas' populations were committed to agrarianism that was of great importance for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.|$|R

Until the 1960s, however, the country remained very poor and largely underdeveloped due to its disadvantaged starting position and lack of effective policies to counter that situation. Salazar managed to discipline the Portuguese public finances, after the chaotic First Portuguese Republic of 1910-1926, but consistent economic growth and development remained scarce {{until well into the}} 1960s, when due to the influence {{of a new generation of}} technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, the Portuguese economy started to take off with visible accomplishments in the people's quality of life and standard of living, as well as in terms of secondary and post-secondary education attainment. During the early period of Salazar's rule, a brand new road system was built, new bridges spanned the rivers, and an educational program was able to build a primary school in each Portuguese town (an idea developed and begun during the democratic First Republic). Some liberal economic reforms advocated by elements of the ruling party, which were successfully implemented under similar circumstances in neighboring Spain, were rejected out of fear that industrialization would destabilize the regime and its ideological base and would strengthen the Communists and other left-wing movements. In 1958, when the Portuguese government announced the 1959-64 Six-Year Plan for National Development, a decision had been reached to accelerate the country's rate of economic growth, a decision whose urgency grew with the outbreak of guerrilla warfare in Angola in 1961 and in Portugal's other African territories thereafter. Salazar and his policy advisers recognized that additional military expenditure needs, as well as increased transfers of official investment to the [...] "overseas provinces", could only be met by a sharp rise in the country's productive capacity. Salazar's commitment to preserving Portugal's [...] "multiracial, pluricontinental" [...] state led him reluctantly to seek external credits beginning in 1962, an action from which the Portuguese treasury had abstained for several decades.Beyond military measures, the official Portuguese response to the [...] "winds of change" [...] in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the Overseas Province of Angola and Mozambique, boomed.The liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar's successor, Prime Minister Marcello José das Neves Caetano (1968-1974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged European Community. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most community goods and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 percent of the EC's total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, EFTA membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal's industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in Sines. Notwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers. Before the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more <b>outward-looking</b> economic <b>policy,</b> Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960 to 1973 under the Estado Novo regime (and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against independence guerrilla groups), created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.|$|R
