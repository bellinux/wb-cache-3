5|$|In 1971 Matlock became Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department. During Richard Nixon's presidency, {{a period}} known as détente, {{there was a}} {{reduction}} of Cold War tension. Matlock participated in the negotiation <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> treaties and other bilateral agreements. In fact, he attended {{every one of the}} U.S.-Soviet summits for the 20-year period 1972–1991, {{with the exception of the}} 1979 Carter - Brezhnev summit.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the need}} for a fission primary, and the {{difficulty}} of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> efforts to limit nuclear proliferation rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.|$|E
25|$|The Agency's {{reputation}} grew considerably by the mid-1970s, as {{decision makers}} increasingly recognized {{the value of}} its products. Agency analysts in 1972 concentrated on Lebanon, President Richard Nixon's visit to China, the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, the formation of Sri Lanka, and the prisoners of war being held in Southeast Asia. Subsequent challenges involved: détente; the development <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> agreements; the Paris peace talks (Vietnam); the Yom Kippur War; and global energy concerns.|$|E

40|$|Owing to the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{exemption}} {{that allows}} governments to subsidize arms exports, the arms trade {{is one of}} the few remaining areas of trade where we observe export subsidies. This paper examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>controls,</b> in the form of licensing delays, on the incentives to subsidize arms exports and conversely the effect <b>of</b> the WTO <b>arms</b> trade exemption on the incentives to break <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> agreements. Our main result is that <b>arms</b> <b>controls</b> and free trade commitments re-enforce each other. Licensing delays reduce the incentive to subsidise and free trade without subsidies reduces the benefits of a unilateral abrogation <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>controls.</b> Transparency actually worsens the Nash inefficiencies at play in that incomplete information leads to lower subsidies and lower arms exports.

25|$|Military cooperation– Past {{examples}} of international cooperation exist. One {{example is the}} security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union {{after the end of}} the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see START I, START II, START III, and New START) and the establishment of NATO’s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.|$|E
500|$|Kosygin {{acted as}} a {{mediator}} between India and Pakistan in 1966, and got both nations to sign the Tashkent Declaration. Kosygin became the chief spokesman on the issue <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control.</b> In retrospect, many of Kosygin's co-workers felt he carried out his work [...] "stoically", but lacked [...] "enthusiasm", and therefore never developed a real taste for international politics.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Kistiakowsky {{suggested}} to President Eisenhower that inspection of foreign military facilities {{was not sufficient}} to control their nuclear weapons. He cited the difficulty in monitoring missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections. In January 1960, as part <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>control</b> planning and negotiation, he suggested the [...] "threshold concept". Under this proposal, all nuclear tests above the level of seismic detection technology would be forbidden. After such an agreement, the US and USSR would work jointly to improve detection technology, revising the permissible test yield downward as techniques improved. This example of the [...] "national means of technical verification", a euphemism for sensitive intelligence collection used in arms control, would provide safeguards, without raising the on-site inspection requirement to a level unacceptable to the Soviets. The US introduced the threshold concept to the Soviets at the Geneva arms control conference in January 1960 and the Soviets, in March, responded favorably, suggesting a threshold of a given seismic magnitude. Talks broke down {{as a result of}} the U-2 Crisis of 1960 in May.|$|E

2500|$|The UN Security Council {{has demanded}} that Iran suspend its nuclear {{enrichment}} activities in multiple resolutions. The United States {{has said the}} [...] "central bargain of the NPT is that if non-nuclear-weapon states renounce the pursuit of nuclear weapons, and comply fully with this commitment, they may gain assistance under Article IV of the Treaty to develop peaceful nuclear programs". The U.S. has written that Paragraph 1 of ArticleIV makes clear that access to peaceful nuclear cooperation must be [...] "in conformity with ArticlesI and II of this Treaty" [...] and also by extension ArticleIII of the NPT. Rahman Bonad, Director <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Control</b> Studies at the Center for Strategic Research at Tehran, has argued that demands to cease enrichment run counter to [...] "all negotiations and discussions {{that led to the}} adoption of the NPT in the 1960s and the fundamental logic of striking a balance between the rights and obligations stipulated in the NPT." [...] In February 2006 Iran's foreign minister insisted that [...] "Iran rejects all forms of scientific and nuclear apartheid by any world power," [...] and asserted that this [...] "scientific and nuclear apartheid" [...] was [...] "an immoral and discriminatory treatment of signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty," [...] and that Iran has [...] "the right to a peaceful use of nuclear energy and we cannot accept nuclear apartheid." ...|$|E
