We construct a large data base consisting of 2102 rated syndicated loan deals from 1990 to 2008 in twenty three countries and ten economic sectors. We {{investigate the}} effects on the spread paid over the risk free rate of three major groups of factors: loan characteristics, borrower characteristics and characteristics of country of the borrower, using both qualitative and quantitative variables in a hedonic regression. The results show that all three groups are significant joint determinants of prices of syndicated credit. Our results confirm the existing literature but also provide for first time results stemming form the risk characteristics of the borrower and the country of the borrower. It is shown that distance-to-default as well as aggregate risk associated with country of the borrower are of great concern to the lenders and hence significantly affect the pricing of syndicated loans. Furthermore, we report that financial institutions and public utilities are able to negotiate for cheaper loans, but this result is reversed when financing is for acquisition purposes. <b>Overall,</b> risk, liquidity, <b>solvency</b> and sustainable performance by both the borrower and its domicile country are key determinants of syndicated loan prices.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{a virtual}} {{consensus}} has emerged within the casualty actuarial science community that actuaries must broaden {{their role in}} insurance organizations by developing a set of tools that {{will enable them to}} render expert opinions regarding not only loss reserves but the <b>overall</b> value and <b>solvency</b> of the firm as a whole. In order to support this effort to broaden the roles of casualty actuaries, the Casualty Actuarial Society has embarked upon a many-year, multistage project entitled Dynamic Financial Analysis. This aim of the project is to set up a general actuarial framework for the modeling and financial evaluation of insurance companies as riskassuming, ongoing entities. The outcome of the project will likely be general specifications for insurance company financial models, a database of important variables to support these kinds of models for the purposes of research and model design, and suggested procedures and considerations for those who would design, use and interpret these models. This is the final report for stage 1 of the Dynamic Financial Analysis. 1.

50|$|In 2011, MF Global faced major {{pressures}} to its liquidity over several months. Some analysts and financial commentators indicate that MF Global probably experienced {{a number of}} trading days in 2011 during which the firm's bets on sovereign debt would have required the use of customer funds to meet capital requirements, thereby maintaining operating funds and possibly <b>overall</b> <b>solvency.</b> A large part of these pressures on MF Global were {{a result of the}} firm's involvement in a significant number of repurchase agreements. Many of these repo agreements were conducted off their balance sheet. Also, MF Global made a $6.3 billion investment on its own behalf in bonds of some of Europe’s most indebted nations. Failure of those, and other, repo positions contributed to the massive liquidity crisis at the firm. MF Global experienced a meltdown of its financial condition, caused by improper transfers of over $891 million from customer accounts to a MF broker-dealer account to cover losses created by trading losses.|$|E

[...] The Times also reported that, as MF Global struggled to pay back creditors before parts of the firm could be sold before declaring bankruptcy, [...] "MF Global dipped again and again into customer funds to meet the demands." [...] Bloomberg News reported that such transfers occurred, on at least one occasion, [...] "Per JC's Corzine's direct instruction", according to an internal memo seen by Congressional investigators and Bloomberg. According to Bloomberg, representatives with JP Morgan, who provided credit for MF Global's operations, were also concerned about the source of funds used to maintain or pay back credit lines. Bloomberg reported that [...] "Barry Zubrow, JPMorgan's chief risk officer, called Corzine to seek assurances that the funds belonged to MF Global and not customers. JPMorgan drafted a letter to be signed by Edith O'Brien to ensure that MF Global was complying with rules requiring customers’ collateral to be segregated. The letter was not returned to JPMorgan." [...] Corzine resigned from the firm in early November 2011.|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment is a critical issue raised by Pillar II of Solvency II framework. In particular the <b>Overall</b> <b>Solvency</b> Needs calculation left the Insurance companies to define an optimal entity-specific solvency constraint on a multi-year time horizon. In a life insurance society framework, the intuitive approaches to answer this problem can sometimes lead to new implementation issues linked to the highly stochastic nature of the methodologies used to project a company Net Asset Value over several years. One alternative approach can be the use of polynomial proxies to replicate the outcomes of this variable throughout the time horizon. Polynomial functions are already considered as efficient replication methodologies for the Net Asset Value over 1 year. The Curve Fitting and Least Squares Monte-Carlo procedures are the best-known examples of such procedures. In this article we introduce a possibility of adaptation for these methodologies to be used on a multi-year time horizon, {{in order to assess}} the <b>Overall</b> <b>Solvency</b> Needs...|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} position {{of an economic}} entity {{is a concept that}} can have different meanings, depending on the stakeholder category that make its analysis. In energy sector, which is considered of high importance in the national economy, we consider that the most important category of stakeholder is the state (government), because ensuring the functionality of this sector is an crucial condition for development of others sectors from national economy. For this reason, we can look at the informational needs of other stakeholder categories trough the state’s “sine qua non” condition to ensure the optimal functionality of this sector, which manifests itself like this: the functioning of the sector involves the attraction of investors, the functioning of the sector involves the existence of human resources, the functioning of the sector cannot be ensured without the existence of commercial relations that involves suppliers and clients and for insuring the functioning of the sector it is often require various financing sources. All those aspects are giving raise to some categories of stakeholder interested over the parameters in which the energy sector entities are functioning, one of the interest domain being the {{financial position}} of the companies activating in its field. Over the present study we had in view to highlight the main present approaches regarding the concept of financial position, but also the main issues fallowed by the main stakeholder categories in their attempt to appreciate the financial position of the entities activating in energy sector which are listed to Bucharest Stock Exchange. The results of this study have showed that there is some base requirements regarding the informational needs of stakeholder regarding the financial position of the companies activating in energy sector, and those are related to the concepts of going concern, <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> ratio, general liquidity ratio and indebtedness degree. After this study it has concluded that the going concern is difficult to appreciate trough mathematical indicators. On the other hand, analysis of the <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> ratio, general liquidity ratio and indebtedness degree has shown that in the last 5 years analyzed entities had generally record satisfying evolutions, but it also highlight some entities in which the analyzed indicators show doubts regarding a balanced financial position...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Ciências ActuariaisUnder Solvency II, {{insurance}} undertakings must have, {{as part of}} their risk management system, a regular practice of assessing their <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> needs with a view to their specific risk profile, known as 'Own Risk and Solvency Assessment' (ORSA). ORSA aims to identify whether the particular risk profile of an undertaking deviates from the assumptions underlying the regulatory capital calculation (i. e. European Standard Formula). In this context, this work aims at estimating the undertaking specific parameters (USP) for reserve risk, for Motor Vehicle Liability and Motor Others. In a long term perspective, alternative models were applied to the estimation of the ultimate reserve risk. For Solvency Capital Requirements, a short-term perspective, it is necessary to estimate the one-year reserve risk factors, which was done by applying the three different methods presented and allowed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). The results for the different models and methods in both perspectives were compared and the impact of the USP was assessed in terms of capital gains...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of solvency for insurance companies, within the European Union, {{is currently being}} revised as part of Solvency II Directive. The new definition induces revolutionary changes in the logic of control and expands the responsibilities in business management. The rationale of the fundamental measures of the Directive cannot be understood without reference to probability distribution functions. Many insurers are struggling with the realisation of a so-called “internal model” to assess risks and determine the <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> needs, as requested by the Directive. The quantitative assessment of the solvency position of an insurer relies on Monte Carlo simulation, in particular on nested Monte Carlo simulation that produces very hard computational and technological problems to deal with. In this paper, we address methodological and computational issues of an “internal model” designing a tractable formulation of the very complex expectations resulting from the “market-consistent” valuation of fundamental measures, such as Technical Provisions, Solvency Capital Requirement and Probability Distribution Forecast, in the solvency assessment of life insurance companies. We illustrate the software and technological solutions adopted to integrate the Disar system—an asset–liability computational system for monitoring life insurance policies—in advanced computing environments, thus meeting the demand for high computing performance that makes feasible the calculation process of the solvency measures covered by the Directive...|$|E
40|$|Michael Cotter’s {{article on}} the {{migration}} of pension plans’ structures from defined benefit plans to defined contribu-tion plans in the March/April 2009 issue of Compensa-tion & Benefits Review describes {{the onset of the}} boomer generation’s retirement, with longer life spans and higher medical costs, as “perhaps our country’s biggest financial crisis hiding in plain site. ” 1 Although Cotter’s interest in that article is the <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> of private sector plans and their ability to sufficiently fund the increasing cost of postcareer life that will be experienced by their partici-pants, there are similar issues arising within public sector retirement plans. One looming crisis that appears to be compounding the effect of retiring boomers was derived from a funding source for retirement benefit programs for certain munic-ipal first responders that was legislatively authorized in Florida midway through the last century. This employment class has the largest estimated costs beginning at retire-ment and contributes substantially to a projected $ 3. 4 tril-lion dollar national shortfall in public employee pension costs. 2 The risk to the solvency of plans for first responder benefits by the boomer generations ’ retirement is increased by its participants ’ classification as “special risk members” whose “normal retirement date ” in Florida can begin afte...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the ability of artificial neural networks to forecast the companies’ risk of financial distress. We predicted the bankruptcy risk using the associated financial ratios (overall liquidity ratio and the <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> ratio) and two artificial neural network models based on the backpropagation algorithm. The proposed models were implemented and tested using the PyBrain software and have been applied to 55 companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange during 2010 - 2014. After a total of 19, 944 iterations for the learning stage, the two algorithms converged and the errors obtained during the tests reached the fixed target. The empirical results showed that the artificial neural network models are efficient and reliable in detecting the risk of bankruptcy. The artificial neural networks are very useful in economic analysis when the complexity of data makes it difficult to implement functions that proper describe the link between economic variables. The use of the neural networks method for predicting the risk of bankruptcy is less common in Romania. This study intends to fill this gap in the literature and we believe it could be of interest not only for the companies listed on the stock exchange, but also for investors, shareholders and banks...|$|E
40|$|Upon initial consideration, the logics of {{nationalism}} and democracy {{seem to be}} contradictory. Nationalism appears to be predicated upon a doctrine of exclusivity, whereas democracy appears {{to be based on}} an inclusivist one. Upon careful contemplation, however, one notices that, historically, these two phenomena have frequently coexisted; even today, democratic regimes seem to exist and thrive (almost exclusively) within nation-states. The aim of this review is to bring together and discuss those works that have addressed the question of whether nationalism and democracy constitute complementary or competing logics. The debate operates on both a theoretical/normative level, and an empirical level. For a first group of scholars, democracy cannot exist without nationalism; it is thought that a certain degree of (cultural) homogeneity is needed for a political system to work. These scholars argue that a common national identity fosters solidarity and trust and gives human beings a sense of belonging. Empirical studies have revealed that (cultural) heterogeneity leads to the deterioration of trust, political participation, and the <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> of the welfare state. Those who emphasize the contradictory logics of these two concepts have not found such correlations in their empirical findings - revealing that multicultural states are also prone to success. Hence, for them, {{there is no reason to}} exclude people from democratic decision-making processes on grounds of their nationality, something that undermines the very principles of democracy. Even worse, it is argued that the fusion of nationalistic and democratic principles has led to some of the deadliest conflicts in modern history...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of new {{insurance and reinsurance}} regulation introduced by the European Directive 2009 / 138 (Solvency II) [4] leads to a complex valuation process to assess risks and determine the <b>overall</b> <b>solvency</b> needs. The development of an “internal model” – “a risk management system developed by an insurer to analyse its overall risk position, to quantify risks and to determine the economic capital required to meet those risks” [5] – generates hard computational problems. The perfect timing of measurements and consequent management actions must be further safeguard. It {{stands to reason that}} the computational performance of the valuation process plays a relevant role; this motivates the need to develop both accurate and efficient numerical algorithms and to use High Performance Computing (HPC) methodologies and resources. The literature on the {{application of}} HPC in the development of “internal model” is very poor; a relevant contribution is given in [1] where is introduced DISAR (Dynamic Investment Strategy with Accounting Rules), a Solvency II compliant system designed to work on a grid of conventional computers. In [2] numerical experiments carried out applying to DISAR a parallelisation strategy based on the distribution of Monte Carlo simulations among processors are reported. The developed parallel software is tested on an IBM Bladecenter using pure MPI implementation and treating every core as a separate entity with its own address space. Now, we show some of experiences in adding a layer of shared memory threading trying to optimize the application built using MPI and OpenMP. At this aim, we use some tools and techniques for tuning the hybrid MPI/OpenMP DISAR implementation...|$|E
