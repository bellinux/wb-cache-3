5|$|The {{beginning}} of the hurricane season is most {{closely related to the}} timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, convective instability, and other thermodynamic factors. Although June marks the {{beginning of}} the hurricane season, generally little activity occurs during the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2years. Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> east coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} models, the handheld has two VGA (0.3-megapixel) digital cameras. The {{first is}} on the internal hinge and points toward the user; the second {{is on the}} outer casing and faces away from the user. The SD card slot is also new, set behind a cover on the right side. While the DS Lite used a switch, the DSi, like the original Nintendo DS, features a button to power on <b>or</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> button has extra functions and unlike the original's power button, it {{is located on the}} bottom-left side of the touchscreen. Brightness and volume controls are on the left side; five brightness settings—one more than on the DS Lite—are available. The headset port is on the bottom.|$|E

5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{naval campaign}} of 1806 was {{fought in the}} Atlantic Ocean, following a raid by two large French battle squadrons on British trade routes, focused particularly on the Caribbean. The security of the French Caribbean was under severe threat during the wars, as the Royal Navy dominated the region and restricted French movements both between the islands and between the West Indies and France itself. This dominance was enforced by rigorous blockade, in which British ships attempted {{to ensure that no}} French military or commercial vessel was able to enter or leave French harbours both in Europe and in the French colonies. In the Caribbean, this strategy was designed to destroy the economies and morale of the French West Indian territories in preparation for attack by British expeditionary forces. To counter this strategy, the French government repeatedly sent convoys and individual warships to the French Caribbean islands with supplies of food, military equipment and reinforcements. These resupply efforts ranged from small individual corvettes to large battle squadrons and were under orders to avoid conflict wherever possible. Despite these orders, many were intercepted by British blockade forces, either in the Caribbean <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> French coast itself.|$|E

25|$|Strike bowling is {{the term}} usually applied to bowlers that are used mainly to get a batsman out at the {{possible}} expense of runs if the wicket-taking is unsuccessful. For fast bowlers, this can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, {{rather than trying to}} make the ball move through the air <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitch. More commonly however, aggressive bowling techniques can be combined with swing bowling and seam bowling techniques to create nigh-on unplayable balls {{in the hands of a}} bowler of any speed. The inswinging yorker is seen as particularly deadly.|$|E
25|$|Hinchinbrook left Port Royal, Jamaica on 19 January 1782 {{and almost}} {{immediately}} started to take on water.

Despite numerous efforts, her crew was unable to get her over <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> reef. A schooner came alongside and took off her guns, some stores, and her crew. She then sank that night.|$|E
25|$|Non-contact - While paintball does involve tagging {{players with}} paintball projectiles, this is {{generally}} considered the sole point of physical contact between members of opposing teams. Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective gear or the markers themselves to hit other players. Fisticuffs in particular are dangerous {{not only to the}} participants but to all players on <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field, and referees are generally trained to respond immediately and aggressively to stop the fight, and to eject and ban instigators of these fights.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transport}} in Damascus depends {{extensively on}} minibuses. There are about one hundred lines that operate {{inside the city}} {{and some of them}} extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on <b>or</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two end points and possibly an important station along the line and Taxicab.|$|E
25|$|A bill, H.R. 3101, the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, {{was passed}} by the United States House of Representatives in July 2010.

The Act requires, in part, for ATSC-decoding set-top box remotes to have a button to turn on <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> closed {{captioning}} in the output signal. It also requires broadcasters to provide captioning for television programs redistributed on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Jack Rowell's {{departure}} (to {{take control}} of the England team) in 1995 and rugby union becoming a professional sport in 1996 has seen Bath struggle to find consistency either on <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field. With regular changes in the coaching staff (including Andy Robinson's appointment as England's Head Coach) and with a seemingly steady turnaround of players, the formula that led to past successes is still being sought. However, Bath captained by Andy Nicol still managed to be the first British club to lift the Heineken Cup, in the 1997–1998 season. Bath beat French club Brive 19–18 in an exciting final in Bordeaux with Jon Callard scoring all the points for Bath.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, {{acting on}} {{information}} {{he had received}} of a large privateer cruising in the Bite <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Skaw, Wood fell in with a large lugger that mounted 16 guns. After a chase of 14 hours, Hound succeeded in shooting away the lugger's main mast and driving her ashore between Robsnout and Hartshall. The wind was driving a heavy sea on the beach {{with the result that}} it soon dashed the lugger to pieces, and probably cost many of the lugger's crew their lives. Wood was pleased to have destroyed his quarry however, as {{she was one of the}} largest and fastest vessels on the coast and when he encountered her was trailing a British convoy from the Baltic.|$|E
25|$|The {{simultaneous}} twin {{objectives of}} bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling {{the ball in}} such a way that the batsman is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient pace that the batsman struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball {{in such a way}} that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batsman, either in the air <b>or</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a truly great bowler may be able to combine all three.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century {{changing}} musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities {{than the}} hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German Bauernleier 'peasant's lyre' and Bettlerleier 'beggar's lyre.' During the 18th century, however, French Rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back {{to the attention of the}} upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is Nicolas Chédeville's Il pastor Fido, attributed to Vivaldi. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string vielle à roue. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on <b>or</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> instrument can be played in multiple keys (e.g., C and G, or G and D).|$|E
