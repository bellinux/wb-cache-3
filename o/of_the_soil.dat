5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E

Sorption data were obtained by equilibrating 3. 0 g of each sample with 30 ml of 0. 01 M CaCl 2 containing various amounts of KH 2 PO 4. The data were then fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich Equations. Results revealed that both models fitted well with the P sorption data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils.</b> <b>The</b> adsorption maxima (X m) and bonding energy (b) values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> derived from Langmuir model were in <b>the</b> ranges <b>of</b> 560 - 833 mg P kg- 1 and 0. 16 - 20 L kg- 1, respectively. The Freundlich capacity factor (Kf) ranged from 237 to 1200 mg kg- 1. <b>The</b> EPRs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> predicted by both models correlated well (r = 0. 99) and ranged from 54 to 667 mg P kg- 1. Forty three percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> had EPR values 150 mg P kg- 1 and were classified as high P sorbing soils. Exchangeable Al 3 + and Fe 2 + significantly and positively correlated with X m, b and Kf. Aluminium and Fe 2 + are major soil properties responsible for the variations in P sorption capacities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
