5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>process.</b> This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, its African-American and poor white populations were {{affected}} by changes to laws by the state legislature, which made voter registration and voting more difficult by requirements including imposition of a poll tax in 1889.

25|$|Instead, they {{emphasized}} that {{suppression of the}} rights of African Americans was a worse scandal and a grave corruption of America's republican ideals. They argued that the tragedy of Reconstruction was not that it failed because blacks were incapable of governing, especially as they did not dominate any state government, but that it failed because whites raised an insurgent movement to restore white supremacy. White elite-dominated state legislatures passed disfranchising constitutions from 1890 to 1908 that effectively barred most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This disfranchisement affected millions of people for decades into the 20th century, and closed African Americans and poor whites out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> in the South.|$|E

Abraham Lincoln's career mirrors the Whigs' political rise, but by the 1840s Springfield began to {{fall into the hands of}} the Democrats, as immigrants changed the city's political makeup.

25|$|Unger's {{proposal}} for political democracy {{calls for a}} high energy system that diminishes the dependence of change upon crisis. This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of {{the party in power}} to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>process</b> and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct participatory democracy in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.|$|E
