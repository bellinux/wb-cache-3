The researcher observed during audit that revenue collected from VAT is continuously decreasing when the economy started to be unstable. VAT administration that was used when the economy was stable is still being used to the unstable economy and this has caused a lot <b>of</b> challenges in <b>VAT</b> administration. This has highly negatively affected revenue collection on VAT. Descriptive research design was used to gather data using questionnaires and interviews as research instruments. A sample of 45 people was used comprises <b>of</b> registered operators, <b>VAT</b> officers, line managers and the managing director of Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA). The research finding indicated that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> administration on revenue collection {{is affected by the}} instability of the economy of Zimbabwe.

To address this problem and to improve economic efficiency and growth, a major tax reform program was initiated in 1991 which centred on {{the introduction of a}} valued-added tax (VAT) to replace a range of narrowly-based consumption taxes. This paper revisit the basic structure <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> system <b>of</b> Bangladesh and attempt to analysis the contribution and performance <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> in Bangladesh as comparing to other developing countries and also attempt to identify and provide some suggestions in possible area where attention and improved performance are required to enhance the contribution <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> in economic development of Bangladesh.

As a result, VAT is unable to meet the objectives for which it was introduced.

40|$|Variable Angle Tow (VAT) {{laminates}} {{that generally}} exhibit variable stiffness properties not only provide extended design freedom, but also offer beneficial stress distributions. In this paper, the prospect <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> composite panels with significantly reduced loss of in-plane compressive stiffness in the postbuckled state {{in comparison with}} conventional structures, is studied. Specifically, we identify that both thickness and local fiber angle variation are required to effectively define “buckle-free” panels under compression loading. In this work, the postbuckling behaviour <b>of</b> variable thickness <b>VAT</b> composite panels is analyzed using an efficient and robust semi-analytical approach. Most previous works on the postbuckling <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> panels assume constant thickness. The additional benefits of tailoring thickness variation in the design <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> composite panels are seldom studied. However, in the process <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>VAT</b> laminates, either by using the conventional Advanced fiber Placement (AFP) machine (tow overlap) or the newly developed Continuous Tow Shearing (CTS) process (tow shrink) thickness build-up is inevitable. The postbuckling optimization for the design <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> layups is conducted by a two-level framework using lamination parameters as intermediate design variables. The objective is to determine optimal lamination parameters and thickness distributions for maximizing the axial compressive stiffness <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> laminates that are loaded in the postbuckling regime. The thickness variation due to both manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> laminates and for where it is independent of manufacturing process are considered. In accordance with the first-level optimal postbuckling solutions in terms of lamination parameters, we investigate a practical “buckle-free” VAT panel using a blended layup configuration. This blended <b>VAT</b> panel consists <b>of</b> a piecewise combination of segmental CTS layers and constant-thickness VAT layers. The prospect of {{taking advantage of a}} benign combination of stiffness and thickness to improve the overall compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> panels is studied. Finally, the optimal results are analysed to provide insight into the manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> laminates using either the AFP or the CTS process for improved postbuckling stiffness under compression loading...|$|R

40|$|Most major economies use a {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{which is a}} {{derivation}} of the French 1954 taxe sur la valeur ajoutée. The initial imposition <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> in France and its spread {{around the world have}} been driven by economic reasons. This thesis focuses on one of these economic triggers: the neutrality <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> as regards the functioning of the economy. It demonstrates that the reason VAT was chosen in France and why thereafter it spread around the world was because it offered the possibility to collect governmental revenue while allowing the economic forces of the market to interplay without being adversely affected. The prerequisite conditions for the existence <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> neutrality are therefore identified herein along with an overview <b>of</b> the <b>VAT</b> mechanism, demonstrating that the concept of neutrality is built into the VAT system in a manner that allows for the preservation of the natural functioning of the market.

In conclusion, remedies for these issues are being sought by a review of the causes <b>of</b> infringement <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> neutrality in the perspective of selected proposals for modified VAT systems. These proposals include redesignating the place where VAT is levied and improving VAT collection.

Whilst VAT laminates exhibiting substantial gains in buckling performance have been shown previously, beneficial ways <b>of</b> using <b>VAT</b> techniques to improve structural performance of composite laminates in the postbuckling regime remain unclear. In the present study, a semi-analytical formulation based on a variational approach is developed and the Rayleigh-Ritz method is subsequently applied to solve the postbuckling problem <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> plates. The generality of the proposed formulation allows effective modelling of the pure or mixed stress boundary conditions and also provides a computationally effcient means to determine the postbuckling strength <b>of</b> <b>VAT</b> plates.
