5|$|Peter Milner, in {{a review}} in the Canadian Journal of Psychology, noted the book was short <b>on</b> <b>concrete</b> details on {{implementing}} the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as {{not being able to}} tie its model to details from neurophysiology at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion studies, showing that some of its regions could possibly implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to how the region could implement the strategy.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than <b>on</b> <b>concrete,</b> and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps. Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay {{for extended periods}} of time in the shelters, as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water to those in need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt <b>on</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted <b>on</b> <b>concrete.</b> This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E

40|$|Structural slabs <b>on</b> {{underwater}} <b>concrete</b> {{are widely}} {{applied in the}} construction of tunnels, parking garages, rail- and road construction. Over the years many problems have been reported with aquiferous crack formation in structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete.</b> Aquiferous trough crack formation threatens the durability of structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete.</b> Through cracks can be the result of restrained deformation. Temperature- and shrinkage strains that are restrained, cause stresses in the structural slabs. Stresses from restrained deformation can cause through crack formation. During the hardening process and due to climate influences, the structural slab is affected by temperature- and shrinkage loads and cracks can form. In the design of structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete,</b> much attention was given to the calculation of stresses and calculation of reinforcement, but still aquiferous crack formation cannot be prevented. Over the years many discussion on the effect of an intermediate layer of sand between the structural slab and the underwater concrete has taken place amongst experts. Nowadays two sides exist; one in favour and the other against an intermediate layer of sand. Both sides are convinced that their alternative outperforms the other. No theoretical bases, but many uncertainties, exist about the magnitude of the stresses in structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete.</b> This research aims to create more insight in the stresses in hardened concrete that cause the forming of cracks in structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete.</b> The results should be used to develop a practical advice for handling of the problem of crack formation in structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete.</b> To obtain the goals of the research first {{the current state of the}} technology is examined in a literature study. To determine the magnitude of the stresses and to analyze the influence factors on the stresses a Finite Element model has been developed. The results of these models were used to come to a practical advice. A thermal model was built to calculate temperature loads. Based on long term temperature measurements in a structural slab <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete,</b> the model has been calibrated. Temperature loads on any given structural slab <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete</b> can now be calculated accurately. The temperature load in structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete</b> can vary between 3 °C and 17 °C. The largest influence factor on temperature load is the month of casting. The geometry of the structure can also have significant influence on the temperature load. A 3 -D Finite Element structural model was designed to research the influence factors on restraint. This has gained more insight in the influence factor on the degree of restraint and the shear forces in the piles. It is now possible to calculate the degree of restraint of any structural variant of structural slabs <b>on</b> underwater <b>concrete.</b> The degree of restraint varies between 15...|$|R
