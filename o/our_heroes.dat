500|$|Shearman and Pearson {{analyzed}} the portrayals {{of several of}} the series' regular characters as 1930s villains, noting several meta-references to the wider series. The two noted that, in his portrayal of a Nazi, Jeffrey Spender was allowed to [...] "cut loose and rant like a proper villain rather than a sulky boy hiding in the basement." [...] In contrast, Walter Skinner's 1939 character behaved more like his character in the wider series, his role [...] "charmingly parodying the ambiguity he's been playing all these years and turning out to be an American-loving ally who tells <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> to get their 'asses out of here'." ...|$|E
500|$|The script {{went through}} many stages. In early 1965, when backing was secured for the film, Clarke and Kubrick {{still had no}} firm idea {{of what would happen}} to Bowman after the Star Gate sequence. Initially all of Discoverys astronauts were to survive the journey; by October 3, Clarke and Kubrick had decided to leave Bowman the sole {{survivor}} and have him regress to infancy. By October 17, Kubrick had come up with what Clarke called a [...] "wild idea of slightly fag robots who create a Victorian environment to put <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> at their ease." [...] HAL 9000 was originally named Athena after the Greek goddess of wisdom and had a feminine voice and persona.|$|E

In his book on the making of Rubber Soul and its legacy, Kruth describes McGuinn's cover as [...] "a supersonic reading" [...] from the [...] "master of the Rickenbacker twelve-string chime". In interviews to promote Limited Edition, McGuinn recalled Harrison's adaptation of the [...] "Bells of Rhymney" [...] riff as being [...] "kind of a cool cross-pollination" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "a great honor to have in some small way influenced <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> the Beatles".|$|E

500|$|... "Jacksonville" [...] premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine {{called it}} [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "well-acted", especially liking John Noble's performance. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining [...] "I liked 'Jacksonville' {{for the way}} it plunged directly {{into the heart of}} the show's mythology for the first time in a while, and even if it didn't tell us much we didn't already know, having the story become more personal for <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> served to create that unsettled feeling at which Fringe excels". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved [...] "Jacksonville", believing it to be a [...] "tremendously moving, startling episode" [...] and [...] "one of [...] finest hours". AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self, and then confronting Walter over it. She also felt Olivia's loss of memory to be [...] "interesting," [...] and became [...] "practically gleeful" [...] at her and Peter's near kiss.|$|E
500|$|At BlizzCon 2015, one {{questioner}} asked Metzen {{about the}} presence of gay heroes in the Overwatch universe; he confirmed that there were such characters, but elaborated, [...] "we want it to play out organically, we don't want it to be a data point or feel contrived in any way". In December 2016, Tracer became the first Overwatch hero to be canonically revealed as LGBT in Reflections, an issue of the Overwatch digital comic; she specifically identifies as a lesbian. In the comic, she is seen in a romantic relationship with Emily, a woman who {{is not part of the}} Overwatch team. Of this reveal, Blizzard stated, [...] "as in real life, having variety in our characters and their identities and backgrounds helps create a richer and deeper overall fictional universe". About Tracer's development specifically, Blizzard stated, [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> who they are. From the very beginning of our work on Tracer's story, it just felt right to make this an aspect of her character." ...|$|E
500|$|Tales of Xillia {{was one of}} the top selling {{games on}} the North American PlayStation Network in August 2013. All English reviewers agreed the battle system was fast and engaging; however, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GameSpot, and PlayStation Official Magazine panned the map designs calling them repetitive, lifeless and bland. The plot {{received}} neutral to positive reception. Game Revolution wrote [...] "There's a pleasing inertia to the way plotlines form, unfold, and reach a conclusion that propels <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> ever-forward, never stopping long enough to feel meandering but never feeling rushed or forced either.", praising the narrative {{to be one of the}} qualities to the game. Game Informer described the plot as [...] "investing" [...] and liked the balance in tragic and lighthearted moments. Joystiq lauded the execution of the plot for avoiding the usual JRPG [...] "info dumps" [...] and how small plot-lines intertwined into a larger conflict. PlayStation Official Magazine considered the plot as average and called it a let-down compared to the combat system. Reviewers have also noted the dual-protagonist execution caused incoherency in Milla's story.|$|E

She wrote an article on gender pay-gap for the 22 August 2014 issue of Forbes India, and is vocal in her support for the issue: [...] "Equal pay won't happen because there is a hero-based industry [...] need to strive for scripts that empower women, make women <b>our</b> <b>heroes,</b> too." [...] Koechlin has presented several monologues aimed at spreading public awareness, and used YouTube as a platform or forum for issues that she advocates for. She appeared in Puma's [...] "Do You?" [...] advertisement campaign which encouraged women to, [...] "find their best self". Koechlin, alongside Jacqueline Fernandez and Sakshi Malik led a group of women at an event, organised as part of the movement, to break the Guinness World Record of “Most people to hold the abdominal plank position” for 1 minute. She has been appointed as the ambassador of such campaigns as Vogue Indias [...] "Vogue Empower" [...] and United Colors of Benetton's [...] "#Unitedbyhalf", initiatives aimed at spreading awareness on issues of women's safety and empowerment, gender equality respectively.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although {{he noted that}} the episode was [...] "not Gilligan's best work" [...] and that the writing was [...] "a little spotty", he said [...] "the vibe [...] is very well done." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't {{sitting on the edge of}} my seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a good job at doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> come off as idiots". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, describing it as a [...] "rather fun tale".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was mostly}} mixed, with results ranging from negative to positive. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'The Rain King' was cute. Very cute. [...] And yet I never found myself suffering from cuteness overload. In fact, I laughed and smiled the entire way through." [...] Starpulse named [...] "The Rain King" [...] as the ninth best X-Files episode and praised the lighter approach to the paranormal, saying that the episode was an [...] "ingenious way to use the paranormal motif of the show for something other than thrills". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade. Despite criticizing the show for [...] "filming {{in the land of}} sunshine and lemon drops" [...] and [...] "border on that overly twee independent movie vibe", Handlen noted that [...] "the episode’s essential sweetness has enough snarky asides from <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> [...] that it never goes completely off the rails." [...] He did, however, note that the episode's placement, after a string of several humorous episodes, hurt its reception; he argued that, had it appeared in an earlier, darker season, the entry would now be viewed as [...] "a cock-eyed classic".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the character has been mixed. BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, he felt her [...] "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of <b>our</b> <b>heroes,</b> is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her {{to a combination of}} Catwoman and [...] "the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from Angel". However, he later admitted Bela was [...] "a great comic foil". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] with the [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be [...] "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel [...] "even a tiny bit sorry for [...] " [...] during her death scene. Writing that [...] "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently"not either annoying or downright contemptible"and deemed her [...] "a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys". Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale [...] "No Rest For The Wicked" [...] that Bela [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a [...] "decent traveling [...] ". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them [...] "look ridiculous", she [...] "really liked" [...] the character. Overall, she felt Cohan [...] "did one hell of a job".|$|E
500|$|... "TS-19" [...] {{garnered}} favorable {{reviews from}} most television critics. In his 8.5 out of 10 rating review, Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode was an exceptional showing for the series, adding that it told [...] "a compelling, intense story within its hour" [...] albeit averting from the comics. As Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The first season of The Walking Dead doesn’t exactly end on an optimistic note, but <b>our</b> <b>heroes</b> are left driving into the unknown after escaping certain death at the CDC." [...] Kurt Christenson of New York Daily News analyzed that [...] "almost and everyone's still kind of in the dark", and Kelly stated that [...] "TS-19" [...] came to an [...] "abrupt, explosive end". Salon journalist Simon Abrams concluded that the frenetic pace of The Walking Dead was relatable, while Paste television commentator Josh Jackson was keen of the character development in the episode {{as well as the}} varying political themes covered; [...] "After six episodes, the characters are worth caring about. Despite occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes, the few living souls in The Walking Dead are a bigger draw than the undead. The show has spent more time on topics like marriage, parenthood, unfaithfulness, loss, domestic violence, gender roles, small-scale politics, loyalty, kindness than it has with kill shots. By filling the world with zombies, Frank Darabont is able to explore the human condition under extreme circumstances." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Dan Snierson was entertained by [...] "TS-19", and asserted that the conclusion [...] "resonated over images of Rick & Co. U-turning into the great unknown, we got the sense that {{as long as they were}} alive, at least there was a chance of a tomorrow." [...] Writing for the same publication, Jeff Jensen was intrigued at how producers approached the themes of the comics, and later noted that it was proof that they were using the comics as a route for thematic inspiration in lieu of a literal interpretation. For Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre, [...] "Tonight's finale [...] did yield much insight, though, into the nature of the plague itself, in relative terms anyway." ...|$|E
