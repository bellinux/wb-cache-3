Bran subsequently confronts Leaf, one of the Children, about creating the White Walkers. She explains that they were at war with the First Men, and had no choice. Bran decides to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> vision without the Three-Eyed Raven. He witnesses a massive army of wights led by the Night King, who touches him whilst in the vision. Bran awakens to find a mark where he was touched, and the Three-Eyed Raven warns that he must leave, as the Night King is now able to find them.|$|E

In the 2013-14 school year, Detroit Public Schools <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> graduation rate of 71% whereas Grosse Pointe High School (Detroit suburb) <b>observed</b> <b>an</b> average graduation rate of 94%. A similar phenomena was observed in Los Angeles, California {{as well as in}} New York City. Los Angeles Senior High School (inner city) <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> graduation rate of 58% and San Marino High School (suburb) <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> graduation rate of 96%. New York City Geographic District Number Two (inner city) <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> graduation rate of 69% and Westchester School District (suburb) <b>observed</b> <b>a</b> graduation rate of 85%. These patterns were observed across the country when assessing the differences between inner city graduation rates and suburban graduation rates.|$|R

5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E

The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship).

They should also perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E

5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed.

Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E

5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> variety of {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety}} of deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the semi-rigid airship N3 after it exploded in heavy weather during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her mooring at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga Dock Company.|$|E

Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, and the main holiday of each major group has been declared a public holiday. The most observed national holiday is Hari Merdeka (Independence Day) on 31 August, commemorating {{the independence of the}} Federation of Malaya in 1957. Malaysia Day on 16 September commemorates federation in 1963. Other notable national holidays are Labour Day (1 May) and the King's birthday (first week of June).|$|E

Sabah are the only state in Malaysia to declare the Kaamatan celebration a public holiday. Both Sabah and Sarawak are also the only two states in Malaysia that declare Good Friday a public holiday. At least nine festivals are being held annually in Sabah such as the Borneo Bird Festival, Borneo Bug Fest, Borneo Eco Film Festival, Kota Kinabalu Food Fest, Kota Kinabalu Jazz Festival, Sabah Dragon Boat Festival, Sabah Fest, Sabah International Folklore Festival and Sabah Sunset Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|Sputnik 2 was not {{designed}} to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on {{members of the public}} to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York; nevertheless, laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.|$|E

The oldest film known is the 1874 Passage de Venus, showing the 1874 Venus transit of the sun. Historically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine {{the size of the}} astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Horrocks in 1639. Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> transit of Venus.|$|E

While resting under a tree, the man finds {{the remains of a}} campsite, discovering that the area they were in has been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 September, the ZNG and Croatian police {{attacked}} the JNA facilities in Bjelovar. In response, Kovačević contacted the JNA 5th Military District in Zagreb and requested airstrikes against {{the city and the}} ZNG. The sources do not indicate if the requested airstrikes were carried out. The 5th Military District instead pressured the central Croatian authorities to order the ZNG in Bjelovar to <b>observe</b> <b>a</b> comprehensive ceasefire previously agreed between Croatia and the JNA on 22 September. In order to verify the ceasefire, the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) deployed a monitoring team to the city. However, the authorities in Bjelovar ignored the order they received from the General Staff and stopped the ECMM team before it reached the city. According to Šimić, the move was made after Lieutenant General Petar Stipetić telephoned him and urged him to continue the attack. The authenticity of Šimić's account of has been disputed by Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo, who claims it was an attempt to discredit Croatia before the ECMM. At 19:00, the ZNG captured Božidar Adžija Barracks. By that time, all other JNA facilities in and near Bjelovar had been captured.|$|E
