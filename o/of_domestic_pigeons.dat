25|$|Variation under {{domestication}} {{became a}} major topic of research: in 1855 he began to develop a web of contacts, both in the UK and worldwide, to get information on the origins and variation of domesticated animals, particularly poultry, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons. He got extensive information, specimens and ideas from Edward Blyth in India, who put him in contact with Edgar Leopold Layard in South Africa. At the suggestion of William Yarrell, Darwin began pigeon breeding at Down House to investigate varieties <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons,</b> and gained access to the expertise of William Bernhard Tegetmeier who was glad to research aspects of interest to Darwin. From March, he also got information and specimens from his relative William Darwin Fox who bred poultry and ducks at his rectory in the parish of Delamere, Cheshire.|$|E
25|$|In {{artificial}} selection {{the new breed}} or variety that emerges is the one with random mutations attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and {{artificial selection}} the variations {{are a result of}} random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same. Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of artificial selection in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection. Much of his book On the Origin of Species was based on these observations of the many varieties <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> arising from artificial selection. Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.|$|E
500|$|A squab is {{the name}} given to the young <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> that are destined for the table. Like other domesticated pigeons, birds {{used for this purpose}} are descended from the rock pigeon (Columba livia). Special utility breeds with {{desirable}} characteristics are used. Two eggs are laid and incubated for about 17 days. When they hatch, the squabs are fed by both parents on [...] "pigeon's milk", a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop. Squabs grow rapidly, but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about [...] By this time, the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a [...] breeding season lasting several months.|$|E

60|$|Again, this {{variability}} {{is usually}} indefinite. You cannot say what direction it will take, or to what particular results {{it is likely}} in any special instance to lead. Marked differences sometimes occur even between the young of the same litter, or between the seedlings sown from the same capsule. As a rule, the variations exhibit themselves in connection with sexual reproduction; but sometimes, {{as in the case}} of 'sporting plants,' a new bud suddenly produces leaves or flowers of a different character from the rest of those on the self-same stem, thus showing that the tendency to vary is inherent, as it were, in the organism itself. Upon this fundamental fact of the existence in nature of numerous and indefinite variations, the whole theory of natural selection is ultimately built up. In illustrating by example the immense variability of domesticated creatures, Darwin lays great stress upon the case of pigeons, with which he was familiar from his long experience as a breeder and fancier in his own home at Down. Naturalists are almost universally of opinion that all the breeds <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons,</b> from the carrier to the tumbler, from the runt to the fantail, are alike descended from the wild rock pigeon of the European coasts. The immense amount of variation which this original species has undergone in domestication may be seen by comparing the numberless breeds of pigeon now exhibited at all our poultry shows with one another.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{discussed}} the probable origin <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> at some, yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion {{in regard to the}} many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature. One circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have ever conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns, and he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species? ...|$|E

60|$|The most {{remarkable}} and instructive example of variation produced by human selection is {{afforded by the}} various races and breeds <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons,</b> {{not only because the}} variations produced are often most extraordinary in amount and diverse in character, but because in this case there is no doubt whatever that all have been derived from one wild species, the common rock-pigeon (Columba livia). As {{this is a very important}} point it is well to state the evidence on which the belief is founded. The wild rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue colour, the tail has a dark band across the end, the wings have two black bands, and the outer tail-feathers are edged with white at the base. No other wild pigeon in the world has this combination of characters. Now in every one of the domestic varieties, even the most extreme, all the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, are sometimes found perfectly developed. When birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed one or more times, neither of the parents being blue, or having any of the above-named marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt to acquire some of these characters. Mr. Darwin gives instances which he observed himself. He crossed some white fantails with some black barbs, and the mongrels were black, brown, or mottled. He also crossed a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead, and the mongrel offspring were dusky and mottled. On now crossing these two sets of mongrels with each other, he obtained a bird of a beautiful blue colour, with the barred and white edged tail, and double-banded wings, so as almost exactly to resemble a wild rock-pigeon. This bird was descended in the second generation from a pure white and pure black bird, both of which when unmixed breed their kind remarkably true. These facts, well known to experienced pigeon-fanciers, together with the habits of the birds, which all like to nest in holes, or dovecots, not in trees like the great majority of wild pigeons, have led to the general belief in the single origin of all the different kinds.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDomestic pigeons are spectacularly {{diverse and}} exhibit {{variation}} in more traits {{than any other}} bird species [1]. In The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin repeatedly calls attention to the striking variation among <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> breeds—generated by {{thousands of years of}} artificial selection on a single species by human breeders—as a model for the process of natural divergence among wild populations and species [2]. Darwin proposed a morphology-based classification <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> breeds [3], but the relationships among major groups of breeds and their geographic origins remain poorly understood [4, 5]. We used a large, geographically diverse sample of 361 individuals from 70 <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> breeds and two free-living populations to determine genetic relationships within this species. We found unexpected relationships among phenotypically divergent breeds as well as convergent evolution of derived traits among several breed groups. Our findings also illuminate the geographic origins of breed groups in India and the Middle East and suggest that racing breeds have made substantial contributions to feral pigeon populations...|$|R

5000|$|Pigeons {{primarily}} use powder down feathers for preening {{which gives}} them a soft and silky feel to their plumage which is unmatched by other birds. Pigeons have no preen gland or at times have very rudimentary preen glands and hence that oil is not used for preening. Powder down feathers are spread across the body which {{have a tendency to}} disintegrate and the powder, akin to talcum powder is used all over the feathers for plumage maintenance. [...] Some subspecies <b>of</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> have modified feathers called [...] "Fat Quills". These feathers contain yellow oil like fat that derives from the same cells as Powder down. This is used while preening and helps in plumage maintenance by reducing bacterial degradation of feathers by feather bacilii.|$|E

The wild rock pigeon has an innate homing ability, meaning that it will generally return to its nest, (it is believed) using magnetoreception. This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances. Flights as long as 1800 km have been recorded by birds in competitive pigeon racing. Their average flying speed over moderate 640 km distances is around 50 mph but speeds of up to 90 mph have been observed in top racers for short distances.|$|R
