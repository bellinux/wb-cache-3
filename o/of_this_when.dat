5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>When</b> stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To {{reduce the risk of}} attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

5|$|Zutphen was {{strategically}} {{important to}} Farnese, as it allowed his troops to levy war {{contributions in the}} rich Veluwe region. Therefore, he left some troops blockading Rheinberg and marched to relieve the town. He personally supplied Zutphen at first, but as the Anglo-Dutch siege continued, he assembled a large convoy whose delivery to the town he entrusted to the Alfonso Félix de Ávalos Aquino y Gonzaga, Marquis del Vasto/Guasto. Leicester learned <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> a courier dispatched by Farnese to Francisco Verdugo, {{the man in charge}} of Zutphen, was intercepted. The English and Dutch prepared an ambush, in which many English knights and noblemen were involved. In the end, the Spanish succeeded in delivering the convoy safely to Zutphen after a hard-fought battle. The Spanish cavalry, composed mainly of Italian and Albanian soldiers, was defeated by the English cavalry under the Earl of Essex. The Spanish infantry, however, held its ground and delivered the convoy to Zutphen. From there, reinforced by Verdugo, the Spanish troops forced the English to retreat.|$|E

25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name. Users take advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.|$|E

Cassander reclaimed Macedon the following year at Pydna and then had her killed. Alexander IV, still a young child, and his mother Roxane were held guarded at Amphipolis and died under mysterious circumstances in 310 BC, probably murdered at the instigation of Cassander to allow the diadochs to assume the title of king.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of DSLR sensors is typically measured in megapixels. More expensive cameras and cameras with larger sensors {{tend to have}} higher megapixel ratings. A larger megapixel rating does not mean higher quality. Low light sensitivity {{is a good example}} <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>When</b> comparing two sensors of the same size, for example two APS-C sensors one 12.1 MP and one 18 MP, the one with the lower megapixel rating will usually perform better in low light. This is because the size of the individual pixels is larger, and more light is landing on each pixel, compared with the sensor with more megapixels. This is not always the case, because newer cameras that have higher megapixels also have better noise reduction software, and higher ISO settings {{to make up for the}} loss of light per pixel due to higher pixel density.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the Type 100 {{proved to}} be an {{effective}} and reliable weapon in close quarter fighting, perceived lack of requirement for SMGs and Japan's poor industrial capacity meant that only around 27,000 were ever produced. As a result <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>when</b> the weapon was issued to regular combat units only officers and some NCOs received it; the Type 100 was never a common battlefield weapon. Special forces units are known to have been prioritized for reception of the weapon {{due to the nature of}} their operations; however, some American service personnel did report encountering the weapon in the Pacific Islands late in the war. Additionally, no Japanese soldier was ever equipped with the weapon until late 1941, and it was not produced in any significant quantity until 1943 — a point at which the manufacturing quality of Japanese weapons had already begun to deteriorate.|$|E

25|$|A report {{published}} in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated {{that in the}} period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet {{was not able to}} forecast or prevent any <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Jamphel Gyatso {{was also}} said to possess {{all the signs}} of being the true {{incarnation}} of the Seventh.

At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a Regent to assist him and after three years <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>when</b> the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804. He is also credited with the construction of the Norbulingka 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.|$|E

Though Dutkiewicz recorded most of the drums himself, Gomes provided additional percussion on the album, before he was an official member of the band. Backing vocals on Alive or Just Breathing were done by Leach, Dutkiewicz, as well as Dutkiewicz's sister Becka, and All That Remains singer Philip Labonte.|$|E
