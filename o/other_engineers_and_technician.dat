40|$|This {{document}} is the Final Report for NASA Grant NAG 8 - 1198 from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). The Grant is entitled "Metrology Mount and Optics Materials. " This final report {{is required by}} the terms of the Grant. The period of performance was from September 15, 1995 through January 14, 1999. Total funding received by SAO from MSFC for this effort was, $ 254, 000. Mr. Lester Cohen carried out most of the work at SAO, but received limited support from <b>other</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>technicians,</b> <b>and</b> designers. Dr. Harvey Tananbaum, the Principal Investigator for the grant provided overall direction and work- assessment. The Grant has had two funding augmentations to its basic amount and has, over time, emphasized three different research areas - each of which has been an extension of earlier research. The research activity was in 2 areas: (1) Expert opto-structural studies related to separation mechanics and effects of electro formed nickel X-ray mirrors. and (2) Design, fabrication and evaluation of a low force metrology and assembly station for light weight full shell electroformed X-ray mirrors...|$|R

These two implement, and maintain reliable and robust communication systems in rural and remote areas. Additional specialized training in other ITS areas by subject matter experts is recommended for the follow-on phase of this project. 17. KEY WORD...|$|R
