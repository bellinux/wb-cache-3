5|$|In March 2007, Farncomb had an {{emergency}} when crew were washed <b>overboard</b> {{while attempting to}} remove fishing line from the propeller. The boat was reportedly conducting surveillance on Chinese Navy submarines in the South China Sea.|$|E
5|$|In another open {{display of}} dissent, the ship's boilers had been {{tampered}} with {{by one of}} the crew. The special blubber-fired boilers had disappeared, apparently thrown <b>overboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried {{to cling to}} the rigging, but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept <b>overboard</b> by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once <b>overboard</b> reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Tony, realizing Big Pussy is an FBI informant, murders him {{on board}} a boat (with {{assistance}} from Silvio Dante and Paulie Gualtieri), then wraps his corpse in chains and throws it <b>overboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} legends have grown around Surcouf over the time: {{he is often}} stated {{to have been made}} a Baron of the Empire, which is untrue. Another legend states that Surcouf had thrown <b>overboard</b> gold seized on Kent; in fact, Kent did not carry gold.|$|E
5|$|Rough seas {{killed a}} person on a Navy Destroyer the USS Goldsborough DDG-20 in Pearl Harbor when the seaman hit a stanchion, with four others injured on the ship. One of the four injured was swept <b>overboard</b> two miles (three kilometers) from the harbor. Before {{the arrival of the}} hurricane, around 1,000 {{evacuated}} the low-lying coastline to shelters.|$|E
5|$|U-47 {{carried out}} ten combat patrols {{and spent a}} total of 238 days at sea. She sank 31 enemy ships (totalling 164,953 tons) and damaged eight more. Prior to her {{disappearance}} in March 1941, U-47 lost one crewman, Heinrich Mantyk, who fell <b>overboard</b> on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|Upon her return, Confiance {{ran into}} the British {{blockade}} and was chased by a frigate; Surcouf managed to evade her by throwing <b>overboard</b> {{all but one of}} her guns, his boats, anchors, chains and even components of his masts. He eventually arrived at La Rochelle on 13 April 1801.|$|E
5|$|After Labor's {{defeat at}} the 2001 federal election, Gillard {{was elected to}} the Shadow Cabinet under then-Labor Leader Simon Crean, where she was given {{responsibility}} for Population and Immigration. In February 2003, she was given additional responsibilities for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs. In these roles, {{in the wake of the}} Tampa and Children <b>Overboard</b> affairs, which were partly credited with Labor's 2001 election loss, Gillard developed a new immigration policy for the Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|After {{a five-year}} retirement, in early 1807, Surcouf ordered the 18-gun Revenant, a {{privateer}} {{which he had}} built on his own specifications. On 2 March, he departed Saint-Malo with a 192-man crew to cruise off Bengal. On 9 March 1807, while en route, off Madeira, Revenant captured the British slave ship Aun, of sixteen 12-pounders, recently departed from Liverpool, which Surcouf let go for a ransom, after throwing her guns <b>overboard,</b> wetting her gunpowder and destroying some of her sails.|$|E
5|$|After the 6th U-boat Flotilla was disbanded in December 1939, U-43 was {{assigned}} to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven. U-43 departed from there on 13 March 1940 and sailed along the coast of Norway, north of Scotland, and into the waters west of Ireland, but had no success. The First Watch Officer (second-in-command of the U-boat) Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Wilhelm Behrens fell <b>overboard</b> and was lost on 31 March. U-43 returned to Wilhelmshaven, after 25 days at sea, on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophe {{struck the}} Old Bay Line on May 24, 1919, when the Virginia II caught fire shortly after midnight {{in the middle}} of Chesapeake Bay with 156passengers and a crew of 82on board. The ship burned {{completely}} as many passengers jumped <b>overboard</b> and a lifeboat capsized. The Chesapeake Line's City of Norfolk and other vessels came to the rescue and pulled people from the water to safety. The Virginia's captain, Walter Lane, remained with his ship to the end and suffered burns.|$|E
5|$|Cook then {{ordered that}} the ship be {{lightened}} to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown <b>overboard,</b> and the ship's drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns {{with the intention of}} retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.|$|E
5|$|Everyone is {{in disbelief}} that Stewie {{would try to}} murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and {{explains}} what happened. After falling <b>overboard,</b> she was rescued by a merman. Having developed retrograde amnesia, she starts working at a fat camp in North Carolina. While in a diner, she meets a new boyfriend, who {{turns out to be}} a white supremacist. While at a white supremacist rally, she takes a blow to the head and regains her memory, at which point she returns to Quahog.|$|E
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured. His followers found him {{and took him to}} Westminster Abbey. On his recovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward's rule. Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses. Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported to have fallen <b>overboard</b> and drowned without any witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump <b>overboard.</b> Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the race, {{the solar}} winds {{dissipate}} and the Buccaneer pulls ahead of the Edwardian ship. Not wishing to see Wrack win, the Eternals return the TARDIS to the Doctor, allowing him to travel to the Buccaneer. However, he is captured, and Wrack's first mate suggest that the Doctor and Turlough be thrown <b>overboard.</b> From the Edwardian ship, Tegan and the others watch as two bodies are ejected from the Buccaneer just before it crosses the finish line.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{possession}} of the Royal Navy, President and her crew were ordered to proceed to Bermuda with Endymion. During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed Presidents masts and strained Endymions timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown <b>overboard</b> to prevent her from sinking. Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States, a U.S. Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers, and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of President.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown <b>overboard.</b> James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown <b>overboard,</b> and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E
5|$|Povenmire left USC without {{finishing}} the degree requirements, {{and used the}} money from Fish merchandise to fund a short-lived career as a street artist. His first professional animation commission came on the Tommy Chong project Far Out Man, for which Povenmire produced two minutes of animation. By age 24, Povenmire was freelancing on several animated television series, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 1989, he appeared in a small role as a band member in Adam Sandler's first film, Going <b>Overboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ramón Jiménez, Fernández's stepfather, {{defected}} from Cuba in 2005, {{settling in}} Tampa, Florida. Fernández attempted to defect unsuccessfully three times, with each failed defection attempt {{followed by a}} prison term. Fernández, along {{with his mother and}} sister, defected in 2007. On that successful attempt, José's mother fell <b>overboard</b> when the boat hit turbulent waters, and José had to dive into the water to save her life. They reached Mexico, and then moved to Tampa in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Santa Cecilia, {{under the}} command of Captain Don Ramon de Chalas, had {{meanwhile}} sat in Puerto Cabello until Captain Edward Hamilton, aboard , cut her out of the harbour on 25 October 1799. Hamilton led a boarding party to retake Hermione and, after an exceptionally bloody action, sailed her out of danger under Spanish gunfire. The Spanish casualties included 119 dead; the British took 231 Spaniards prisoner, while another 15 jumped or fell <b>overboard.</b> Hamilton had 11 men injured, four seriously, but none killed. Hamilton himself was severely wounded.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 2004– Heavy surf from Hurricane Jeanne kills {{a man to}} {{the east}} of Oak Island after he is thrown <b>overboard</b> from his boat. Three days later the storm's {{remnants}} cross the western portion of the state, causing the third flood in a month; the flood from Jeanne is less severe and shorter in duration than that from Ivan and Frances.|$|E
5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 ships that some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook were pushed <b>overboard</b> to make room for more helicopters to land. Other helicopters dropped off their passengers and were then ditched into the sea by their pilots, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.|$|E
5|$|Surcouf {{sailed to}} Mergui to {{purchase}} food and free his prisoners, and put to sail on 10 December. En route, {{he met the}} fellow French privateer Malartic, under Jean Dutertre; soon after, the privateers met a British frigate, 38-gun frigate HMS Sybille, which gave chase and which Surcouf managed to outsail by throwing eight guns <b>overboard,</b> along with various other implements.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, with a slight roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost <b>overboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} {{has inspired}} several works of literature. Fred D'Aguiar's novel Feeding the Ghosts (1997) {{tells the story}} of an African who survives being thrown <b>overboard</b> from the Zong. In the novel, the journal of the slave—Mintah—is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water <b>overboard</b> to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E
5|$|The {{first port}} of call was Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which Endeavour reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage. While in port, an {{accident}} cost the life of master's mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged <b>overboard</b> when the anchor was released. To replace him, Cook shanghaied a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.|$|E
5|$|The last {{survivors}} of the Batavian squadron were harried along the coast by the faster forces in the British fleet with Sylph overhauling the 16-gun Mercury, forcing it to surrender just before 11:00. The Batavian captain had thrown 14 cannon <b>overboard</b> {{in an effort to}} lighten his ship and allow it to escape British pursuit, but without success. Later in the day, Halstead's Phoenix was able to seize the Batavian prize Duke of York, completing the destruction of the entire Batavian squadron.|$|E
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men <b>overboard</b> and spreading gasoline fires in the waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Southeast, {{the storm}} caused heavy {{agricultural}} damage, {{with up to}} a third of the sugarcane and cotton crops destroyed in the hardest-hit plantations. Reports of strong winds extended as far inland as eastern Tennessee. At Norfolk, Virginia, northeasterly gales on October8 and9 kept steamboats at dock. Several ships, including the Enterprise and the Cumberland, were lost along the Outer Banks. One sailor fell <b>overboard</b> and drowned when a schooner ran aground at Swansboro, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942. As her {{whaleboat}} was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell <b>overboard</b> {{and failed to}} ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of life vest on that required being inflated by mouth. This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that Omahas boarding party's return to wearing the older style life jackets that had proven themselves effective {{even though they were}} more cumbersome and bulky.|$|E
5|$|Witherspoon has cited actresses like Meryl Streep, Holly Hunter, Susan Sarandon, Frances McDormand, Debra Winger, Diane Ladd, Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster, Goldie Hawn, Sally Field, Sigourney Weaver, Lucille Ball, Carole Lombard, Judy Holliday, Gena Rowlands, {{and actors}} like Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson, and Michael Keaton as {{influences}} in her acting. Her favorite films are Splendor in the Grass, Waiting For Guffman, Broadcast News, Raising Arizona, and <b>Overboard.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{formidable}} French squadron {{under the}} command of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois had left Toulon bound for Cadiz to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in Egypt. On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown <b>overboard</b> to lighten the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. He and the crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper hove to {{in order}} to rescue her man <b>overboard</b> and Glowworms survivors. The German sailor was not found, but 40 British sailors were recovered, {{although}} at least six later died of their wounds. Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards Hipper was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E
