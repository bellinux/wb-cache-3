40|$|We {{argue that}} {{consistent}} {{decision making in}} judging a patent’s validity and basing this on its underlying technological quality are important elements of patent office service (“assessment”) quality. To understand which level of assessment quality patent offices (can) provide, particularly in new technological areas, we study the concordance of the European Patent Office's (EPO) granting and <b>opposition</b> <b>decisions</b> for individual patents. Using the biotechnology industry in the 1980 s (an emerging patenting area then) as an example, we find no empirical evidence that the EPO provided maximal or optimal assessment quality as far as can be told from bibliographic indicators. We discuss research limitations and consequences of this first empirical analysis, and suggest ideas for refinements in future work...|$|R

5000|$|By the Friday {{before the}} elections, five {{opposition}} political parties had {{withdrawn from the}} election: Democratic Action (Acción Democrática), COPEI (Social Christian Party of Venezuela), Project Venezuela (Proyecto Venezuela), Justice First (Primero Justicia), and A New Era (Un Nuevo Tiempo). These political parties represented {{the majority of the}} opposition forces in the country. Vice President José Vicente Rangel declared that [...] "they know that they are defeated because they too read the surveys and know that if they participate they will have a poor representation." [...] He also stated that the U.S. Department of State, through their embassy in Caracas, was responsible for the withdrawals. The New York Times noted that [...] "The <b>opposition</b> <b>decision</b> appeared to be aimed at appealing to international support and discrediting Venezuela's government, which has strong approval ratings." [...] José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, was quoted as saying [...] "It's really hard to understand what exactly the political opposition leadership has in mind. But certainly {{it is not going to}} help them to present themselves as victims that deserve solidarity from the international community. With these kinds of tactics I don't think they'll gain any ground." ...|$|E
40|$|Indicator-based {{methods that}} enable {{inexpensive}} evaluations of patent rights {{appear to have}} great potential as management tools. However, as of today these methods still require refinement to satisfy companies ’ applied needs. This paper analyzes the validity of so-far untested indicators of patent value to {{enhance the quality of}} patent assessments using indicators. Following an overview {{of the state of the}} art, the article expands the theory by eliciting patent attorneys ’ strategies to maximize profits from protecting intellectual property. Inspirations for the computation of new value indicators are gathered. Then, based on a newly compiled data set consisting of 813 EP patents, the probability of an opposition against a patent is modeled by established and new value indicators. The untested indicators draw from publicly available procedural information as well as full-text documents. The results show that accelerated examination requests and qualified word counts are correlated with the <b>opposition</b> <b>decision</b> and enhance the quality of existing valuation methods.

50|$|The Arab community, being {{essentially}} agrarian, is loosely knit and mainly {{concerned with}} local interests. In {{the absence of}} an elective body to represent divergences of interest, it therefore shows a high degree of centralization in its political life. The Arab Higher Committee presented a 'common front' for all political parties. There was no <b>opposition</b> party. <b>Decisions</b> taken at the center. Differences of approach and interest, can be discerned, the more so from the strong pressure that is brought against them. In times of crisis, as in 1936-1938, such pressure has taken the form of intimidation and assassination. At present time, nonconformity regarding any important question on which the Arab Higher Committee has pronounced a policy is represented as disloyalty to the Arab nation.|$|R
