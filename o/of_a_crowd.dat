40|$|Background: Amyloid fibrils {{associated}} with neurodegenerative diseases {{can be considered}} biologically relevant failures of cellular quality control mechanisms. It is known that in vivo human Tau protein, human prion protein, and human copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) have the tendency to form fibril deposits in <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> tissues and they are {{associated with}} different neurodegenerative diseases, while rabbit prion protein and hen egg white lysozyme do not readily form fibrils and are unlikely to cause neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we have investigated the contrasting effect of macromolecular crowding on fibril formation of different proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings: As revealed by assays based on thioflavin T binding and turbidity, human Tau fragments, when phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase- 3 b, do not form filaments in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crowding</b> agent but do form fibrils in the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crowding</b> agent, and the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>crowding</b> agent dramatically promotes amyloid fibril formation of human prion protein and its two pathogenic mutants E 196 K and D 178 N. Such <b>an</b> enhancing effect <b>of</b> macromolecular crowding on fibril formation is also observed for a pathological human SOD 1 mutant A 4 V. On the other hand, rabbit prion protein and hen lysozyme do not form amyloid fibrils when <b>a</b> <b>crowding</b> agent at 300 g/l is used but do form fibrils in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crowding</b> agent. Furthermore, aggregation of these two proteins is remarkably inhibited by Ficoll 70 and dextran 70 at 200 g/l...|$|R
