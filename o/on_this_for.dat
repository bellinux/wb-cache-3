5|$|Gillings had an {{inventory}} of material that he had acquired while editing Fantasy, and he drew <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> Science Fantasy, as well as incorporating his own fanzine, Science Fantasy Review, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during {{the latter half of}} the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of New Worlds, and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.|$|E
500|$|Tucson, Arizona based Big Splash Games {{was formed}} in late 2005 by three {{veterans}} of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> a few months {{when they were not}} working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co-founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, [...] "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they [...] "had {{hit the nail on the}} head".|$|E

Most women who are murdered are buried by members of their family in secret, and their deaths are not reported to any official body. The Palestinian media also refrain from reporting <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> <b>for</b> the sake of [...] "family honor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway had {{obtained}} an Act of Parliament in 1875 {{to construct a}} new loop line through the town, which would allow trains to serve the town and then continue along the main line. [...] No action was taken <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> many years {{which led to a}} planning blight along the proposed route. [...] An 1880 court case forced the Great Western Railway to pay 5% interest to the affected property owners, which prompted the railway company into action.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, the {{complete}} edition of Lost Girls was published, as a slipcased {{set of three}} hardcover volumes. The same year Moore published an eight-page article tracing out the history of pornography in which he argued that a society's vibrancy and success are related to its permissiveness in sexual matters. Decrying that the consumption of contemporary ubiquitous pornography was still widely considered shameful, {{he called for a}} new and more artistic pornography that could be openly discussed and would have a beneficial impact on society. He expanded <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> a 2009 book-length essay entitled 25,000 years of Erotic Freedom, which was described by a reviewer as [...] "a tremendously witty history lecture – a sort of Horrible Histories for grownups." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{attempt was}} made in 1872 when the Bombay Presidency {{commissioned}} John Griffiths to work with his students to make copies of Ajanta paintings, again for shipping to England. They worked <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> thirteen years and some 300 canvases were produced, {{many of which were}} displayed at the Imperial Institute on Exhibition Road in London, one of the forerunners of the Victoria and Albert Museum. But in 1885 another fire destroyed over a hundred of the paintings in storage in a wing of the museum. The V still has 166 paintings surviving from both sets, though none have been on permanent display since 1955. The largest are some 3×6 metres. A conservation project was undertaken on about half of them in 2006, also involving the University of Northumbria. Griffith and his students had unfortunately painted many of the paintings with [...] "cheap varnish" [...] in order to make them easier to see, which has added to the deterioration of the originals, as has, according to Spink and others, recent cleaning by the ASI.|$|E
2500|$|... “And {{now that}} the strong mass {{movement}} hasn’t turned up, nor the influx of young workers (we had counted <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> the period after the war, and it was certainly the fundamental motive of the GIC in regrouping with Communistenbond Spartacus {{in the last year}} of the war), it follows logically that the GIC returned to its old role, not preventing the Communistenbond Spartacus from returning to its old role as RSP. According to my information, the question of which form of propaganda to choose is presently being discussed in the GIC ... it’s a pity that Jan Appel has stayed with the people of Communistenbond Spartacus. Already in the past, I have noted how his spirit and his conceptions are determined by his experiences in the great German movement which was the culminating point of his life. It’s there that he formed his understanding of the organisational techniques of the councils. But he was too much a man of action to be content with simple propaganda. But the wish to be a man of action in a period in which the mass movement doesn’t yet exist, easily leads to the formulation of impure and mystified forms of action. Perhaps it’s a good thing after all that Communistenbond Spartacus has held on to one strong element.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Silvestri {{would return to}} compose the score for the crossover film Marvel's The Avengers. Silvestri found it helpful to have already {{been part of the}} [...] "Marvel process", which gave him a [...] "sense of how Marvel treats their characters, cares for them, and a bit of what that Marvel post-production process feels like". Director Joss Whedon preferred an [...] "old-school ... old-fashioned" [...] score to using pre-existing songs, which he felt makes [...] "the moment [...] about the song". He called Silvestri [...] "letter perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion ... but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." [...] Silvestri did not want the score to have the same [...] "military" [...] feeling as Captain America: The First Avengerss, as Stark says in the film [...] "We’re not soldiers." [...] However, Whedon did want aspects of the film to resemble a war film, and [...] "there are times where [...] absolutely functioning as this paramilitary unit", so Silvestri did add some [...] "military seasoning" [...] in places. Both Whedon and Silvestri wanted the score to build throughout the film, to climax in the final battle. For the aftermath of that fight, Silvestri uses a simple guitar piece to give the audience a rest with a [...] "complete sonic break" [...] from what comes before in the film. He then segues back into the full orchestra {{for the end of the}} film. For a sequence where the villain Loki attacks while a string quartet plays Franz Schubert's String Quartet No. 13 in A minor, the editors had already overlaid the piece with a temp track for when Loki [...] "starts to do his thing". Silvestri expanded <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> the final score, having the music transition from the onscreen quartet to the entire orchestra playing the same piece when the fighting begins.|$|E
