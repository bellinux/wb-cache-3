30|$|Against the {{background}} that, empirically, the incidence rates of overeducation and overskilling are above underqualification and underskilling, we restrict {{our attention to}} the determinants of educational and skill-based <b>overqualification.</b> <b>For</b> both dependent variables, we extend the intercept-only models by different sets of variables (Tables  5 and 6). First, we include a variety of socio-demographic variables and variables reflecting worker human capital (models 1). In this study, female workers have higher odds of being formally overeducated (+[*] 11.3 [*]%), whereas (as for overskilling) having children and a migration background do not additionally attract significant coefficients in the pooled sample. As a separate model for males reveals, males who did not learn German as their first language on average have a 6.8 [*]% higher probability of overeducation. Similarily, an employment gap is positively related to the risk of overeducation in the pooled and the male sample.|$|R

The goal is to dynamically allocate the job into memory to minimize the usage of space without concurrency. The SRF problem is just {{a variant of the}} DSA problem. Our results are as follows. •The NP-completeness for the 2 -SRF problem, 3 -DSA problem, and DSA problem <b>for</b> <b>jobs</b> with agreeable deadlines. •An improved 3 -competitive algorithm <b>for</b> <b>jobs</b> with agreeable deadlines on single-device DSA problems. A 4 -competitive algorithm <b>for</b> <b>jobs</b> with agreeable deadlines on multi-device Balancing DSA problems. •Lower bounds <b>for</b> <b>jobs</b> with agreeable deadlines: any non-clairvoyant algorithm cannot be (2 −ϵ) -competitive and any clairvoyant algorithm cannot be (1. 54 −ϵ) -competitive. •The first O(logL) -competitive algorithm <b>for</b> general <b>jobs</b> on multi-device Balancing DSA problems without any assumption...|$|R
