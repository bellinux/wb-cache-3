5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board.

Two members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR).

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> had not been advised {{that there was a}} raised fire risk at the time.

WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> with the window backgrounds painted grey.

The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey.

30|$|Another {{important}} observation can be {{made when}} looking at TableÂ  3 vertically. Clearly, learners made during <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> their training a proportionally more intensive use of pictures and ideal pictures than {{what they had been}} doing in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> their <b>training.</b> While <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> pictures learners inserted reached 80 % (i.e. 91.77 / 113.83) <b>of</b> that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipes described in the book at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training,</b> this ratio remained low (approx. 35 %) in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training.</b> <b>The</b> same is true with respect to the ideal picture accompanying <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> a recipe. While ideal pictures ornate approximately 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipes at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training,</b> only 17 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipes included such a picture mid-way through <b>the</b> <b>training.</b> This is probably {{due to the fact that}} the products, which they produced early in their training were not considered âworth a pictureâ, while those towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> were <b>of</b> higher quality. Interestingly, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> recipes with answers to a prompt displays quite a different picture: the recipes completed in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> did show answer(s) to prompt(s) in the attached learning journals almost as often as those inserted in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> (62 vs 68.5 %).|$|R

5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front to the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction {{to the west of the}} station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> identification and destination codes leading to the routing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> into the pocket track.|$|E
