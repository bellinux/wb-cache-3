A linear model {{was developed by}} simplifying the well known Activated Sludge Model No. 1 and incorporated into an optimization scheme. A program was developed to detect control points on the pH and ORP profiles to control aeration duration in an alternating system.

Both systems could save significant aeration energy, in addition to handling the variation of influent nitrogen loading. The model-based optimization approach has some advantages over the pH and ORP sensor control scheme, since the effluent ammonia level can be set by an operator according to the effluent regulation.

Here, we apply this principle to a microbial recombinant protein production process in a bioreactor by exploiting bio-calorimetric methodology. Temperature sensor signals from the cooling system of the bioreactor were used for estimating the metabolic heat of the microbial culture and from that the specific growth rate and active biomass concentration were derived. By applying sequential digital signal filtering, the soft sensor was made more robust for industrial practice with cultures generating low metabolic heat in environments with high noise level. The estimated specific growth rate signal obtained from the three stage sequential filter allowed controlled feeding of substrate during the fed-batch phase of the production process. The biomass and growth rate estimates from the soft sensor were also compared with an alternative sensor probe and a capacitance <b>on-line</b> <b>sensor,</b> for the same variables.

Information from <b>on-line</b> <b>sensors</b> concerning contaminant concentrations in groundwater allow for the real-time characterization and control of a contaminant plume. In this paper it is proposed to use the CPU-efficient Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) method, a data assimilation algorithm, for jointly updating the flow and transport parameters (hydraulic conductivity and porosity) and state variables (piezometric head and concentration) of a groundwater flow and contaminant transport problem. A synthetic experiment is used to demonstrate the capability of the EnKF to estimate hydraulic conductivity and porosity by assimilating dynamic head and multiple concentration data in a transient flow and transport model. In this work the worth of hydraulic conductivity, porosity, piezometric head, and concentration data is analyzed {{in the context of}} aquifer characterization and prediction uncertainty reduction. The results indicate that the characterization of the hydraulic conductivity and porosity fields is continuously improved as more data are assimilated. Also, groundwater flow and mass transport predictions are improved as more and different types of data are assimilated. The beneficial impact of accounting for multiple concentration data is patent.

40|$|As {{manufacturing}} technology moves toward more computerized automation, {{statistical process control}} (SPC) techniques must adapt {{to keep pace with}} the new environment and take advantage of the development in automated on-line sensors. In this paper, a two-phase procedure is proposed for combining an <b>on-line</b> <b>sensor</b> and a control chart to improve statistical process control decisions. In phase 1 of this procedure, a production process is monitored continually by a sensor. When a sensor warning signal is observed, phase 2 takes place: A sample of items is drawn from the process and inspected. If the sample mean is outside the predetermined control limits, the process is stopped, and a search is initiated to determine the actual process status for possible necessary adjustment. If the sample mean is within the control limits, the process continues. A mathematical model is formulated for jointly determining the sample size and the control limit of the control chart and a decision rule for sending out sensor warning signals. The model is based on the assumption that there is only a weak relationship between the sensor measurement and the process condition. A solution algorithm based on a numerical search is developed. A numerical example is used to show the advantage of the proposed model over the models based separately on the sensor and the control chart, and a sensitivity analysis is used to show the effects of several important model parameters on the optimal solution. statistical process control, <b>on-line</b> <b>sensor,</b> economic models...|$|E
