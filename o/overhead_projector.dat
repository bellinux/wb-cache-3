25|$|An LCD {{projector}} {{is a type}} {{of video}} projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or <b>overhead</b> <b>projector.</b> To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The LCD projector was invented in 1984 by Gene Dolgoff.|$|E

Computer presentation programs became {{available in the}} 1980s, {{making it possible to}} lay out a presentation digitally. Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using LCD <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors.</b> Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a video projector, computer monitor, or large-screen television.|$|R

50|$|Older <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> used a tubular quartz bulb {{which was}} mounted above a bowl-shaped {{polished}} reflector. However, because the lamp was suspended above {{and outside the}} reflector, {{a large amount of}} light was cast to the sides inside the projector body that was wasted, thus requiring a higher power lamp for sufficient screen illumination. More modern <b>overhead</b> <b>projectors</b> use an integrated lamp and conical reflector assembly, allowing the lamp to be located deep within the reflector and sending a greater portion of its light towards the Fresnel lens; this permits using a lower power lamp for the same screen illumination.|$|R
