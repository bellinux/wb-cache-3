Over time, park {{management}} policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection <b>over</b> <b>development.</b> In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation {{laid out in the}} 1930 act.

The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised [...] "Guiding Principles and Operating Policies", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations.
