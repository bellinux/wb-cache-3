40|$|Treating <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> {{in cases}} <b>of</b> {{cardiovascular}} emergencies has demonstrated to {{be a large}} expense to the health care system, primarily borne by the society as they contribute to taxes/levies that support local hospitals for indigent care. Interventions to reduce the cardiovascular risk factors among <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> are expensive but have proven to be an effective alternative to the present situation, which is to treat them only in cases <b>of</b> emergencies. <b>The</b> metabolic syndrome (MS) poses a threat particularly to <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> population because <b>of</b> its asymptomatic nature. Detection and treatment of MS at its onset provides substantial clinical benefit over long periods.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{included}} two overarching objectives. Through a systematic review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature published between 1990 and 2012, the first objective aimed {{to assess whether}} insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> would result in higher costs compared to insuring the currently insured. Studies that quantified the actual costs associated with insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. were included. Based upon 2009 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the second objective aimed to assess and compare <b>the</b> self-reported health <b>of</b> populations with four different insurance statuses. <b>The</b> second part <b>of</b> this study involved a secondary data analysis of both currently insured and currently uninsured individuals {{who participated in the}} MEPS in 2009. The null hypothesis was that there were no differences across <b>the</b> four categories <b>of</b> health insurance status for self-reported health status and healthcare service use. The alternative hypothesis was that were differences across <b>the</b> four categories <b>of</b> health insurance status for self-reported health status and healthcare service use. Methods: For the systematic review, three databases were searched using search terms to identify studies that actually quantified <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured.</b> Thirteen studies were selected, discussed, and summarized in tables. For the secondary data analysis of MEPS data, this study compared four categories of health insurance status: (1) currently uninsured persons who will become eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) healthcare reforms in 2014; (2) currently uninsured persons who will be required to buy private insurance through the PPACA health insurance exchanges in 2014; (3) persons currently insured under Medicaid or SCHIP; and (4) persons currently insured with private insurance. The four categories were compared on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> demographic information, health status information, and health conditions with relatively high prevalence. Chi-square tests were run to determine if there were differences between the four groups in regard to health insurance status and health status. With some exceptions, the two currently insured groups had worse self-reported health status compared to <b>the</b> two currently <b>uninsured</b> groups. Results: <b>The</b> thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review included: (1) three cost studies from 1993, 1995, and 1997; (2) four cost studies from 2001, 2003, and 2004; (3) one study of disabilities and one study of immigrants; (4) two state specific studies of uninsured status; and (5) two current studies of healthcare reform. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> thirteen studies reviewed, four directly addressed the study question about whether insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> was more or less expensive than insuring the currently insured. All four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studies provided support for the study finding that <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> would generally not be higher than insuring those already insured. One study indicated that <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> would be less expensive than insuring the population currently covered by Medicaid, but more expensive to insure than <b>the</b> populations <b>of</b> those covered by employer-sponsored insurance and non-group private insurance. While the nine other studies included in the systematic review discussed the costs associated with insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> population, they did not directly compare <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> population with <b>the</b> costs associated with insuring the currently insured population. For the MEPS secondary data analysis, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chi-square tests indicated that there were differences in <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> disease status by health insurance status. As anticipated, with some exceptions, <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> reported lower rates of disease and healthcare service use. However, for the variable attention deficit disorder, <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> reported higher disease rates than the two insured groups. Additionally, for the variables high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and joint pain, the currently insured under Medicaid or SCHIP group reported a lower rate <b>of</b> disease than <b>the</b> two currently insured groups. This result {{may be due to the}} lower mean age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currently insured under Medicaid or SCHIP group. Conclusion: Based on this study, with some exceptions, the costs for insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> should not exceed healthcare-related costs for insuring <b>the</b> currently <b>uninsured.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systematic review indicated that the U. S. is already paying some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs associated with insuring <b>the</b> <b>uninsured.</b> PPACA will expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans who are currently <b>uninsured,</b> as <b>the</b> individual mandate and insurance market reforms will require. Because many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>uninsured</b> are relatively healthy young persons, the costs associated with expanding insurance coverage to <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> are anticipated to be relatively modest. However, for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> construing these results, it is important to note that once individuals obtain insurance, it is anticipated that they will use more healthcare services, which will increase costs.
