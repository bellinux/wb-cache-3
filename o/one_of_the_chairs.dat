2500|$|According to one {{persistent}} tale, Menelik {{heard about}} the modern method of executing criminals using electric chairs during the 1890s, and ordered 3 for his kingdom. When the chairs arrived, Menelik learnt they would not work, as Ethiopia {{did not yet have}} an electric power industry. Rather than waste his investment, Menelik used <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> as his throne, sending another to his [...] "second" [...] (Lique Mekwas) Abate Ba-Yalew. Recent research, however, has cast significant doubt on this story, and suggested it was invented by a Canadian journalist during the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Ecclesiastical {{privileges}} {{were granted}} to the order almost from its beginning. Alexander IV freed the order from {{the jurisdiction of the}} bishops; Innocent VIII, in 1490, {{granted to the}} churches of the order indulgences such as can only be gained by making the Stations at Rome; Pope Pius V placed the Augustinians among the mendicant orders and ranked them next to the Carmelites. Since the end of the 13th century the sacristan of the Papal Palace was always to be an Augustinian friar, who would be ordained as a Bishop. This privilege was ratified by Pope Alexander VI and granted to the Order forever by a Bull issued in 1497. The holder of the office was Rector of the Vatican parish (of which the chapel of St. Paul is the parish church). To his office also belonged the duty of preserving in his oratory a consecrated Host, which had to be renewed weekly and kept in readiness in case of the pope's illness, when it was the privilege of the papal sacristan to administer the last sacraments to His Holiness. The sacristan had always to accompany the pope when he travelled, and during a conclave it was he who celebrated Mass and administered the sacraments. He lived at the Vatican with a sub-sacristan and three lay brothers of the order (cf. Rocca, [...] "Chronhistoria de Apostolico Sacrario", Rome, 1605). Augustinian friars, as of 2009, still perform the duties of papal sacristans, but the appointment of an Augustinian bishop-sacristan lapsed under Pope John Paul II with the retirement of Petrus Canisius Van Lierde in 1991. In papal Rome the Augustinian friars always filled <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chairs</b> of the Sapienza University, and one of the consultorships in the Congregation of Rites.|$|E
