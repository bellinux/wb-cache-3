5|$|Polish {{sociologist}} {{and historian}} of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include: {{the founding of}} sociology in Poland; his work in empirical sociology; and his work in sociological theory. Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps: between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches; between <b>objectivity</b> <b>and</b> subjectivity; between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints; and between American and European intellectual traditions.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of <b>objectivity</b> <b>and</b> impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|Expressionist {{architecture}} {{developed in}} the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles, with e.g. Fritz Höger, Erich Mendelsohn, Dominikus Böhm, and Fritz Schumacher being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it {{is the home of}} Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New <b>Objectivity),</b> <b>and</b> of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius. Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper. Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Hans Kollhoff, Sergei Tchoban, KK Architekten, Helmut Jahn, Behnisch, GMP, Ole Scheeren, J. Mayer H., OM Ungers, Gottfried Böhm and Frei Otto (the last two being Pritzker Prize winners).|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the impact of experience, independency, <b>objectivity,</b> integrity, <b>and</b> {{competence}} to the quality of audit result of local government using multiple regression analysis. The object of this study is the city or district inspectorate in central java as goverment internal auditor. This study is an empirical study with purposive sampling techniques of data collection. Respondents in this study are the Inspectorate of Semarang, Pekalongan, Salatiga district, Semarang and Kendal. There are six variables in this research that consist of five independent variables namely experience, independency, <b>objectivity,</b> integrity, <b>and</b> competence and one dependent variable that is the quality of audit result. According to the results of research, it can be concluded that <b>objectivity,</b> integrity <b>and</b> competence significantly affect the quality of audit result, while experience and independence did not significantly affect the quality of audit result. The coefficient of determination indicates that the <b>objectivity,</b> integrity <b>and</b> competence simultaneously affect the dependent variable (the quality of audit result) of 60. 10...|$|R

5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} <b>objectivity</b> <b>and</b> subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

30|$|Besides Gilbert Hottois (1984) and Bruno Latour (1987), Donna Haraway forged {{the term}} “technoscience”: 7 “The world-building alliances {{of humans and}} nonhumans in technoscience shape {{subjects}} and objects, subjectivity <b>and</b> <b>objectivity,</b> action <b>and</b> passion, inside and outside in ways that enfeeble other modes of speaking about science and technology.

25|$|Rudolf Steiner, {{who founded}} the esoteric spiritual {{movement}} anthroposophy, used the concept of Ahriman to name one of two extreme forces which pull humanity away from the centering influence of Christ.

He thought that contemporary Christianity was subject to Ahrimanic influence, since it tended towards materialistic interpretations. Steiner predicted that Ahriman, as a supersensible Being, would incarnate into an earthly form, 'some little time after our present earthly existence, in fact in the third post-Christian millennium'.|$|E
