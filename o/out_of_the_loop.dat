Deciding to leave Krycek <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop,</b> Mulder calls Scully (Gillian Anderson) and asks her to conduct Grissom's autopsy. Mulder then heads to Grissom's clinic in Stamford, Connecticut, where he is confronted by an angered Krycek.

5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop)</b> raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E

40|$|When {{distribution}} channel partners make specific investments, tailored {{to a particular}} supplier, it could prompt either opportunism or beneficial (e. g., extra-role) behaviors. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investment in turn may depend on whether the channel partner perceives that it is being left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>loop</b> by <b>the</b> supplier, {{as well as that}} partner’s achievement orientation. This study considers a sample of 155 IT professional service firms and finds that their knowledge-intensive, transaction-specific investments (TSIs) encourage distinct behavioral intentions. If they perceive that the supplier is leaving them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>loop,</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TSIs get amplified in relation to opportunistic and extra-role behavioral intentions. Furthermore, the firms’ achievement orientation moderates these influences. Suppliers thus should attend closely to achievement-oriented partners to ensure they do not perceive that they have been left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>loop...</b>|$|R

On 16 May 1966, he went on leave prior to retirement (LPR). Osmani's successor as DDMO was Rao Farman Ali, who played a controversial role in the 1971 Bangladesh War. Ali was reportedly horrified at Osmani's treatment by the army; his office was run-down, Osmani was kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> and office employees treated him with disdain. According to Ali, Osmani was not promoted because he was Bengali and deemed untrustworthy by the high command.|$|E
25|$|Little {{was done}} to prepare for air attack. Inter-service rivalries between Kimmel and Short did not improve the situation. Particularly, most {{intelligence}} information was sent to Kimmel, assuming he would relay it to Short, and vice versa; this assumption was honored mostly in the breach. Hawaii {{did not have a}} Purple cipher machine (although, by agreement at the highest levels between U.S. and UK cryptographic establishments, four had been delivered to the British by October 1941), so Hawaii remained dependent on Washington for intelligence from that (militarily limited) source. However, since Short had no liaison with Kimmel's intelligence staff, he was usually left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop.</b> Henry Clausen reported the war warnings could not be more precise because Washington could not risk Japan guessing the U.S. was reading important parts of their traffic (most importantly Purple), as well as because neither was cleared to receive Purple.|$|E
25|$|Although by {{and large}} the Crusaders {{accepted}} the outcome, the event soured relations. The Crusader leaders felt cheated at having been left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> after the casualties they suffered in defeating the Turkish relief force, but the resentment was greater among the Crusader rank and file, who were deprived of the prospect of plunder and outraged at the Byzantines' respectful treatment of the Muslim captives. In {{the aftermath of the}} city's fall, Boutoumites was named by Alexios as doux of Nicaea. He was successful both in keeping the Crusader rank and file, still eager for pillage, in check – they were not allowed into the city except in groups of ten – and in soothing their leaders through gifts and securing their pledge of allegiance to Alexios. He also persuaded some of the Crusaders to enroll in the Byzantine army. They were then employed in garrisoning Nicaea and repairing its walls.|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} written by Brannon Braga, who sought to write a time-travel related episode without using a [...] "screwed up time-lines" [...] type plot. Braga called it the most enjoyable episode he wrote all season, as {{he had never seen}} a timeloop episode before but {{he did not know how}} to get the crew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop,</b> nor what the message was which would be passed to a future loop. He {{attributed}} the poker game, which was not in the original plan, to a sugar rush after eating pancakes. He felt that the destruction of the Enterprise was the best possible teaser for the episode, and he was pleased how he managed to tie the poker game into the overall plot. Braga named the USS Bozeman for his hometown of Bozeman, Montana, while the registration number of NCC-1941 was a reference to the 1979 film 1941.|$|E
500|$|The {{first section}} of Green Lantern is {{basically}} a mirrored version of Rougarou, a roller coaster at Cedar Point in Ohio. Leaving the station, the train starts by climbing the [...] chain lift hill, on which the Green Lantern oath is played over loudspeakers along the steps. At the top, the train goes through a pre-drop before making a slightly-banked 180° turnaround. After this, the train goes down a [...] drop into a [...] vertical loop. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop,</b> the track rises to the right into a [...] diving loop, hugging the first drop of Superman: Ultimate Flight.

After a small hill, the train then rises to the left into the mid-course brake run. It then drops into a right corkscrew, turning right and weaving through the diving loop. The track then makes a ground-hugging left turn and enters a low, second right corkscrew. After a right turn the train makes a final, 180° left turn into the final brake run {{before returning to the}} station. Green Lantern is [...] long, with a ride taking about 2 minutes to complete.|$|E

2500|$|Cooling towers {{are also}} used in HVAC systems that have {{multiple}} water source heat pumps that share a common piping water loop. In this type of system, the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere. [...] By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> water and reject it into the space to be heated. [...] When the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate boilers.|$|E
