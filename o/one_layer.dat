The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E

5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in <b>one</b> <b>layer.</b> Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E

5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from <b>one</b> <b>layer</b> at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{has a high}} {{sodium and}} fat content, and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains {{in an effort to}} reduce salt and fat. Due to this, low-fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. In 2009, seven large cafe chains in the UK made a commitment to reducing salt and fat through similar substitutions. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which <b>one</b> <b>layer</b> is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with <b>one</b> <b>layer</b> of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E

5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from <b>one</b> <b>layer</b> to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has <b>one</b> <b>layer</b> of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes {{the learning of}} a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks (FNNs) <b>one</b> <b>layer</b> at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.|$|E

25|$|The {{network of}} {{electrodes}} connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge {{to the surface}} electrode repels the particles {{to the bottom of}} local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white.

25|$|Electrons {{are excited}} from their current molecular/atomic orbital.

These layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons.|$|E
40|$|Edge {{detection}} is {{the most}} fundamental {{but at the same}} time most important task in image processing and analysis. In the paper a hybrid approach combining Neural Network and Fuzzy logic based edge detection algorithm is proposed to detect edges in grayscale images.

The network consists of three <b>layers,</b> <b>one</b> input <b>layer,</b> <b>one</b> hidden <b>layer</b> and <b>one</b> output <b>layer.</b> Fuzzy membership functions are used to convert neurons of input and hidden layer into fuzzy neurons. So the output of first and second layer is the membership value of the corresponding input in the fuzzy set. The proposed technique provides advantage of both neural networks and fuzzy logic and gives satisfactory results for both noisy and noise free images. The method is compared with Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel and Laplacian of Gaussian and other neural network and fuzzy logic based methods and the experimental results reveal that proposed method gives better edge map considering the problem of false edge detection...|$|R
