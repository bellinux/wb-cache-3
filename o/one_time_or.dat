The de-construction projects were all meant to improve salmon runs by allowing more fish to reach suitable spawning grounds.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements that at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, {{it is not to}} be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written {{over a period of several}} centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E

When one has mastered the routine, it is awfully monotonous; and one {{has nothing to do with}} <b>one's</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>one's</b> brains.

5000|$|In their brief, plaintiffs cite several {{definitions}} of the terms [...] "occupation" [...] and [...] "business." [...] The general import of these definitions is that one is engaged in an occupation or business when that work <b>or</b> activity occupies <b>one's</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> attention {{on a regular basis}} for profit or support. See United States v. King, 532 F.2d 505, 510 (5th Cir.1976); Southern Guaranty Insurance Company v. Duncan, 131 Ga.App. 761, 764, 206 S.E.2d 672 (1974). Inasmuch as the ordinance does not define [...] "occupation" [...] or [...] "business", the common definition cited above applies. High Ol'Times, supra. Plaintiffs' activity, regardless of its peculiarity, falls within this definition. (551 F.Supp. 349 (S.D. Ga. 1982)) ...|$|R
