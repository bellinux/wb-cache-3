5|$|Marrow <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids <b>or</b> <b>blood.</b> In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.|$|E

It is more common in those with depression.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> tests.|$|E

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, <b>or</b> <b>Blood</b> Alley.|$|E

5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E

5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food <b>or</b> <b>blood</b> (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E
