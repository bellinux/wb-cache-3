5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century {{a range of}} {{structural}} and decorative restoration works were carried out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> which continues to serve the Taunton congregation, who meet for services twice a month at the chapel.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was first operated as the Christchurch studio for Television New Zealand (TVNZ), who displayed their logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Shows such as What Now, After School, Simon Barnett's quiz show Face the Music and later The Son of a Gunn Show were filmed {{in the tower}} block. TVNZ vacated the building in late 1998 following a decision to move all of their Christchurch-produced shows to Wellington. In the late 1990s, Telstra New Zealand, the telecommunications company of Telstra in New Zealand, owned the naming rights to the building. After Clear Communications was acquired in December 2001 to form TelstraClear, the Clear logo was prominently displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The building's naming rights were sold to The Radio Network and it was renamed to Radio Network House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd. At the time of demolition the logo of Newstalk ZB, a subsidiary of The Radio Network, was displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E

5|$|The major {{excavation}} {{of the site}} {{in the winter of}} 2004–05 concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and a 10m (33ft) zone surrounding it. The results indicated that {{there were a number of}} phases of occupation. The remains of the building were reburied after excavation, so nothing is now visible at the surface.|$|E
5|$|The modular {{construction}} principle even {{extended to the}} restrooms of the tower: they arrived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> site as completely enclosed modules, ready to be fixed into position on each floor and have external services connected.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|As the 999-year {{leasehold}} {{building has}} been gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for architectural conservation, {{the new owner}} was asked to preserve the building's façade. There were, however, no similar restrictions on its interiors. Renovation works were carried out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> from 1994 to 1995. The Nam Tin building was then converted into the Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store, and was renamed Yue Hwa Building. The department store was opened on 9 October 1996, and sells a range of traditional Chinese products including herbs, medicines, porcelain, furniture, arts and crafts, garments and textiles.|$|E
5|$|Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca {{state in}} Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a {{different}} orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, {{and drug dealers}} and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|For {{some twenty}} years, Teller advised Israel on nuclear matters in general, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of a {{hydrogen}} bomb in particular. In 1952, Teller and Oppenheimer {{had a long}} meeting with David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv, telling him {{that the best way}} to accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in a nuclear reactor. Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist Yuval Ne'eman, who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller visited Israel six times, lecturing at Tel Aviv University, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members.|$|E
5|$|From when it opened, {{the tower}} was {{referred}} to as both the Bond Tower and the R Tower, owing to the presence of both logos on the building's exterior. The Bond Corporation logos were later removed from the tower, {{and by the end of}} 1994, the signage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was updated to match the new name and logo of its owner and head tenant, Bankwest.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Goss, then bishop, {{awarded the}} {{commission}} {{for the building}} of the new cathedral to Edward Welby Pugin (1833–1875). By 1856 the Lady chapel of the new cathedral had been completed. Due to financial resources being diverted to the education of Catholic children, work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> ceased at this point and the Lady chapel now named Our Lady Immaculate served as parish church to the local Catholic population until its demolition in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rastrelli's {{original}} {{plans for}} the building were found in Vienna, Austria. This {{made it possible to}} reconstruct the original images <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s, overlooked by the main architect-restorer, V. Korneyeva. Since 1968, the church has been opened as a museum to tourists and visitors. The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, when a {{large chunk}} of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the British {{administration}} drew up an urban plan for the development of Chamba. They laid emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of civic buildings around the Chaugan to conceal the unorthodox structural layout of the residential complexes. The western oriented development programme grew particularly active after the arrival of Major Blair Reid in January 1863, during the reign of Raja Shri Singh. The next fourteen years in particular, until his retirement in March 1877, were characterised by large-scale building projects in Chamba, with Reid fully revising the administrative and revenue departments of Chamba and reorganizing the state machinery to make development more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Kirkcaldy Town House on Wemyssfield is the centrepiece of the town's civic square. It was {{designed}} in the 1930s by David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. World War II stopped work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> until 1950. Construction was split into two phases: the west wing, which was completed in 1953, and the east wing, completed in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} inside the church was done by volunteers under the {{direction}} of paid plumbers, electricians, and craftsmen. In addition, all of the pattern-makers and mechanics who worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> did so without pay. There was also a group of women who shined marble and granite until the pieces were full of luster.|$|E
