As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the <b>old</b> <b>house,</b> and all the old porches were restored.

50|$|Island Homes is {{a series}} of photos which {{recorded}} the <b>old</b> <b>houses</b> that still remained on the Toronto Islands. Since the ownership of the Islands was transferred from the City of Toronto to the newly created Metro Toronto in 1954, the <b>older</b> <b>houses</b> remaining on the Island confronted a high risk of demolition. Hickox is interested in recording the historical structures of <b>older</b> <b>houses</b> that are at a higher risk of demolition and aims to “document the homes in the community as they stand today”. While a reporter from Toronto Magazine asked her why she does not like large changes or renovations of <b>old</b> <b>houses,</b> she responded, “Every house comes with its own history” Hickox said she got her own aesthetic from the <b>older</b> <b>houses</b> and she would like to keep the feeling of a house. Hickox will continue to shoot for the series over the next few years.|$|R

5|$|Documents {{indicate}} the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village {{from at least}} the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating {{the existence of the}} Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged into <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants of these families continue to live in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist. The naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region, including East Worldham, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789).|$|E

50|$|Up until 1935, {{the space}} between the church and columns was entirely {{occupied}} by <b>old</b> <b>houses</b> abutting onto the façade of the church itself. Indeed, the church complex was fully surrounded by <b>old</b> <b>houses.</b> Despite the plans to conserve this ancient urban fabric, the renovations led to the demolition of the <b>old</b> <b>houses</b> and the isolation of the monument on the front side. Following bombing during World War II, the church complex became isolated also on the rear side, where the fenced Basilicas Park now stands, allowing popular views of the Basilica.|$|R
5|$|In June 2011, Rowling {{launched}} a new website announcing an upcoming project called Pottermore, where all future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated. Pottermore opened {{to the general public}} on 14 April 2012. Pottermore allows users to be sorted, be chosen by their wand and play various minigames. The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey though the story with access to content not revealed by J.K. Rowling previously, with over 18,000 words of information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe. In September 2015, the website {{launched a}} newly designed site containing news, features and articles plus previously unreleased writing by Rowling and removed some features including the interactive Moment illustrations, House Cup and Sorting ceremony. A newly designed Sorting Ceremony was subsequently launched on 28 January 2016 in which users could reclaim their <b>old</b> <b>house</b> or be re-sorted.|$|E

For over 24hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third {{by the collapse of}} an <b>old</b> <b>house</b> and a massive tree. One of the most famous geological features of the island of Gran Canaria, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium, was destroyed by Delta's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria's shore.

5|$|Prior to 1821, the House of Keys had no {{official}} home, but met first at Castle Rushen, and {{later at the}} Bishop of Sodor and Man's library in Castletown. After criticism from a Royal Commission, plans were drawn up for a new meeting house for the Keys in 1813, but after concerns about the cost, they were redrawn and approved in 1819. The building, designed by Thomas Brine, was completed in 1821. It housed the House of Keys until 1874, when the Keys followed the other primary functions of the island and moved to Douglas. After their move, the <b>Old</b> <b>House</b> became a branch of 's Bank, and later Parr's Bank. In 2000, Manx National Heritage acquired the building and began restoring the house to how it appeared in 1866. The building {{opened to the public}} as a museum in November 2001.|$|E
