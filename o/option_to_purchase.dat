5|$|Following Hungary's {{membership}} of NATO in 1999, {{there were several}} proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US.

Despite breaking his collarbone during the Rückrunde, Holtby made 22 Bundesliga appearances in his debut season for Hamburg and started in both legs of the club's relegation playoff victory over Karlsruher SC.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June, Braathens SAFE {{announced}} that starting on 27 October, the company put one aircraft into {{service on the}} route from Oslo to Stockholm.

The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June; Braathens SAFE bought 50% of the company's scheduled division, Transwede Airways, with an <b>option</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the rest in 1997. The companies planned to integrate their networks, to allow connection between Braathens SAFE's and Transwede flights at Stockholm.

5|$|To help {{combat the}} {{negative}} press, Aberhart resolved {{to gain control}} of the Albertan, the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an <b>option</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Rosenthal {{was forced}} out by Dey in a complex scheme. Dey was negotiating, as owner of The Arena, with both Rosenthal {{on behalf of the}} Senators and Percy Quinn (who held an <b>option</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the Quebec NHA club) on behalf of a {{proposed}} new professional league over exclusive rights to the Arena for professional hockey. In a plan to derail the proposed new league, Dey maintained publicly that he had reserved the Arena for Quinn's proposed league when, in fact, he had not cashed a cheque received from Quinn to reserve an option on the Arena. Rosenthal, believing the club could no longer play at the Arena, attempted to find alternate arrangements for the club, including refurbishing Aberdeen Pavilion, but was unsuccessful. Dey purchased Rosenthal's share of the club on October 28, 1918, and Rosenthal resigned from the club. Quinn filed a lawsuit against Dey for his deception but it was dismissed. Quinn would get further action from the NHL, as the NHL suspended Quinn's franchise and took over its players' contracts.|$|E
5|$|The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford.

The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1December 1899, and from then on the MR (the Metropolitan line of the London Underground from July 1933) operated all services on the line.

5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price cuts for various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began offering free covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotion—itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350. Concurrently, Microsoft reported a loss of US$900 million due to the lackluster sales of the device. In August 2013, Dell silently pulled the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the XPS 10 from its online store without a keyboard dock (raising its price back up to US$479), and pulled the device entirely in September 2013. Microsoft's discount on the Surface tablet did result in a slight increase of market share for the device; in late-August 2013, usage data from the advertising network AdDuplex (which provides advertising services within Windows Store apps) revealed that Surface usage had increased from 6.2 to 9.8%.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, No.82 Wing's Canberras were {{slated for}} {{possible}} bombing and reconnaissance tasks against Indonesian forces under Operation Handover, a little-publicised contingency plan {{put into effect}} during the Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi, although no combat ensued. No.2 Squadron Canberras saw extensive action in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971, {{under the control of}} the USAF's 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. The Canberras flew almost 12,000 sorties and delivered over 76,000 pounds of bombs, for the loss of two aircraft to enemy action, and gained a high reputation for their accuracy. No.1OCU was made independent of No.82 Wing in April 1968; its sole purpose from then until its disbandment in June 1971 was to supply trained crews to No.2 Squadron in Vietnam. Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations in 1968, while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Between 1970 and 1973, as an interim measure pending the delayed delivery of the F-111, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms; meanwhile No.2 Squadron continued to operate the Canberra, mainly for aerial survey work in Australia and Indonesia, until disbanding in 1982. The Air Force retained the <b>option</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the Phantoms if the F-111C program was cancelled. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and was highly regarded by its RAAF crews.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would either have to {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term <b>option</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.|$|E
