5|$|Juan Martín del Potro and Roger Federer {{have played}} 24 times with Federer leading 18–6. They have met seven times in Grand Slam tournaments with Federer leading 5–2. Their two most famous Grand Slam tournament {{meetings}} came in 2009. The first {{was in the}} French Open semifinals, when Federer survived a five-set clash {{when he was on}} his way to the only French title of his career. The second was in the final of the US Open, where del Potro stunned five-time defending champion Federer in five sets, ending his 20-match winning streak at Grand Slams. Another high-profile match was in the semifinals of the 2012 London Olympics, where Federer prevailed 19–17 in the final set to secure the Olympic silver medal. They also met in the finals of the Swiss Indoors in 2012, 2013 and 2017, with del Potro prevailing on first two occasions, and Federer <b>on</b> <b>last</b> one of them in tight three-set matches. In the 2017 U.S. Open quarterfinals, in a rematch of the 2009 US Open final, Del Potro again stunned Federer in four sets to end his unbeaten streak in grand slams that year. With this win, Del Potro also denied the first Federer-Nadal match at US Open, as in 2009 where he crushed Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals. Federer, however avenged this loss at the Shanghai Masters semifinals, where he beat del Potro in three sets after coming from a set down.|$|E
