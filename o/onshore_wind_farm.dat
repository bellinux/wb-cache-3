500|$|Scout Moor Wind Farm is {{the second}} largest <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> in England. The wind farm, which was built for Peel Wind Power Ltd, {{produces}} electricity from 26Nordex N80 wind turbines. It has a total nameplate capacity of 65MW of electricity, providing 154,000MW·h per year; enough to serve the average needs of 40,000homes. The site occupies [...] of open moorland between Edenfield, Rawtenstall and Rochdale, [...] and is split between the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in northern Greater Manchester and the Borough of Rossendale in south-eastern Lancashire. The turbines are visible {{from as far away}} as south Manchester, [...] away.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015 {{planning}} permission was granted by Rossendale Borough Council's development control committee {{to add a}} further 14 turbines at Scout Moor to create what is believed would be England's largest <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>farm,</b> but the plans drew many objections from residents and two petitions were launched by local MPs opposing the scheme. In 2017 The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid MP overruled Rossendale council’s decision but said he was [...] "minded to approve" [...] two additional turbines in Rochdale with a maximum height of 115 metres, subject to conditions, which would potentially enlarge Scout Moor to 28 turbines.|$|E

500|$|The wind farm, which {{stretches}} across nearly [...] of open moorland between Edenfield, Rawtenstall and Rochdale, {{was officially}} opened on 25September 2008. {{and was at}} that time the largest <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> in England.As of 26August 2008, 21 of 26turbines had been commissioned and 4,000MW·h of electricity had been exported to the National Grid. The turbines are visible from south Manchester, [...] away, and are expected to produce enough electricity {{to meet the needs of}} 40,000average homes. Scout Moor has the capacity to produce a total of 65MW, compared with the 90MW capacity of Kentish Flats, the United Kingdom's largest offshore wind farm. The total cost of the Scout Moor project was £50million, but Peel Holdings expect the turbines to be in operation for at least 25 years. Since its opening, the wind farm [...] "has become a real tourist attraction"; a calendar showing photographs of the wind farm's construction has been featured in local news stories.|$|E
