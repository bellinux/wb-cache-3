25|$|On 22 December 1384, Mary de Bohun {{had come}} of age, {{and the final}} {{transfer}} of the estate of the Earl of Hereford <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband, Henry Bolingbroke. These included Walter’s fee in Bodenham held by his grandfather, William Devereux, and ½ fee in Moccas and Sutton held by his father, Walter Devereux (died c. 1383).|$|E
500|$|On 31 October 1994 Princess Andrew's two {{surviving}} children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Memorial) in Jerusalem {{to witness}} a ceremony honouring her as [...] "Righteous Among the Nations" [...] for having hidden the Cohens in her house in Athens during the Second World War. Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, [...] "I suspect that it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that her action was in any way special. She was {{a person with a}} deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress." [...] In 2010, the Princess was posthumously named a Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.|$|E
500|$|... "Fifteen" [...] is {{a country}} pop song {{performed}} by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift self-penned the song and co-produced it along with Nathan Chapman. [...] "Fifteen" [...] was released on August 30, 2009 by Big Machine Records, as the fourth single from Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008). The song was inspired by Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she first encountered heartbreak, along with her best friend Abigail Anderson. After writing it, Swift asked Anderson for authorization to record the song (due to personal references in the song); Anderson affirmed and it was ultimately included on Fearless. [...] "Fifteen" [...] is a ballad, which has Swift reminiscing on events that <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and her best friend at the age of 15 and cautioning teenagers to not fall in love easily.|$|E
60|$|Clouds hid {{the moon}} and the night was black and forbidding; but it did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be afraid.|$|R
60|$|It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that her}} rebuke implied a {{familiarity}} {{at which they}} had swiftly but imperceptibly arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Fred, [...] "I do {{not think}} a journey <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> among events possible, and yet without being very fond of this place." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Allen married [...] "the first grown man who asked me", Robert M. Davis, a {{promising}} young singer, and {{they lived in}} Claremont, California, during World War II. It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{to get into the}} movie business as she had always considered it to be exotic. Allen became a writer by default, and having always read constantly and being able to write pretty well, she decided to [...] "write her way out" [...] of the marriage and set out to become financially independent of her husband. She always claimed her first husband's big fault was marrying someone too young.|$|E
2500|$|Tunstall {{said that}} the album's title is {{inspired}} by a recurring dream she had, before discovering that 2010 is the Chinese Year of the Tiger. The dream is about her, seeing a tiger in her garden and goes outside to stroke it. She returns indoors and is seized by the fear {{that she could have}} been killed. Over the years, it has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the reason the tiger responds so passively is that she herself is disguised as a tiger, wearing a tiger suit. She said that while writing and recording the album, she found a new sound she called [...] "Nature techno", which mixes organic instrumentation with electronic and dance textures, much like Björk has been doing since 1993. At a media showcase in London, Tunstall offered an unusual description of the songs from her forthcoming third album: [...] "Like Eddie Cochran working with Leftfield".|$|E
60|$|She spoke, {{and seemed}} only to offend. Elizabeth could not {{conceive}} how such an absurd suspicion should <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and indignantly answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} in that, but I can't accept without knowing my position, and I would not utter {{a word to}} disturb my mother till it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} see you," [...] said Dorothea, having no other words at command. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful {{interpretation}} to this queenly way of receiving him; but {{he went on to}} say what he had made up his mind to say.|$|R
2500|$|The novel had its {{inception}} in a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Women's Service on January 21, 1931, an edited version of which would later be published as [...] "Professions for Women". Having recently published A Room of One's Own, Woolf thought of making this lecture {{the basis of a}} new book-length essay on women, this time taking a broader view of their economic and social life, rather than focusing on women as artists, as the first book had. As she was working on correcting the proofs of The Waves and beginning the essays for The Common Reader, Second Series, the idea for this essay took shape in a diary entry for 16 February 1932: [...] "And I'm quivering & itching to write my--whats it to be called?--'Men are like that?'--no thats too patently feminist: the sequel then, for which I have collected enough poweder to blow up St Pauls. It is to have 4 pictures" [...] (capitalization and punctuation as in manuscript). The reference to [...] "4 pictures" [...] in this diary entry shows the early connection between The Years and Three Guineas, which would, indeed, include photographs. [...] On 11 October 1932, she titled the manuscript [...] "THE PARGITERS: An Essay based upon a paper read to the London/National Society for Women's Service" [...] (capitalization as in manuscript). During this time, the idea of mixing the essay with fiction <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and in a diary entry of 2 November 1932, she conceived the idea of a [...] "novel-essay" [...] in which each essay would be followed by a novelistic passage presented as extracts from an imaginary longer novel, which would exemplify the ideas explored in the essay. Woolf began to collect materials about women's education and lives since the later decades of the 19th century, which she copied into her reading notebooks or pasted into scrapbooks, hoping to incorporate them into the essay portions of The Pargiters (they would ultimately be used for Three Guineas).|$|E
60|$|She {{started up}} in bed as the next {{possibility}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She stopped abruptly, as if {{some new}} thought had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She had {{something}} of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has been into surroundings or touched something that offends his caste. She passed {{people in the streets}} and regarded them with a quickening apprehension, once or twice came girls dressed in slatternly finery, going toward Regent Street from out these places. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that they at least had found a way of earning a living, and had that much economic superiority to herself. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that save for some accidents of education and character they had souls like her own.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{a thought}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She drew away from me. In her eyes I seemed to see {{reflected}} {{the tragedy of}} those few moments in the Cafe des Deux Epingles.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid he'll {{think it}} frightfully expensive," [...] she answered, {{becoming}} thoughtful once more. And {{it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that {{neither of them had}} mentioned the individual to whom they referred.|$|R
60|$|In {{the instant}} {{when she read}} the initials, the name <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{had never}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Sidney might {{possibly}} marry a plain woman.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Griffith {{saw it was}} no good fencing, but an idea <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|And oh! how earnestly Nunaga {{longed for}} a spill! In her despair, poor thing, it did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that at such a pace an upset might break the necks of the whole party.|$|R
60|$|She looks puzzled, casting {{about in}} <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> find a definition, when it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that it is}} easier to point out the {{substantial}} object itself, massive against the dark-blue sky and the early stars.|$|R
60|$|She seemed {{surprised}} to see him standing there, pale, dusty, and with a great weariness shining out of his black eyes, {{and it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> offer him any greeting. She could not say that she was glad to see him, and yet her heart ached when she looked into his pale, sorrowful face. So she was silent.|$|R
60|$|He {{could have}} bitten his tongue {{out for that}} question, but its {{significance}} never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Victoria started. A new surmise had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{upon which}} {{she did not like}} to dwell.|$|E
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as {{a rather}} drastic means {{to this end}} that she might commit suicide.|$|E
60|$|Betty breathed freely again. Her {{knowledge}} of the East Side was small, and {{that there might be}} those there who acted independently of Mr. Jarvis, disdainful of his influence, did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own affairs, satisfied that danger no longer threatened.|$|R
60|$|Sylvia, without {{stopping}} for reflection, caught Teddy's hand {{and ran up}} the slope. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be frightened, although she thought with Teddy that the poor, lonely, eccentric Old Lady had really gone {{out of her mind}} at last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Twinkle, gratefully. It didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{just then}} {{that it was}} {{wonderful}} to be talking to the little prairie-dogs just as if they were people. It seemed very natural they should speak with each other and be friendly.|$|R
60|$|He spoke quickly, {{his tone}} was full of nervous passion. It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to doubt him.|$|E
60|$|The lady {{almost fell}} back {{on the floor in}} her astonishment. The idea had never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again {{her fingers}} were idle. An idea seemed to have <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She asked him a question.|$|E
5000|$|Lonely Lynn - When Lynn Walsh {{loses her}} only friends, {{she turns to}} {{breaking}} up as many friendships as she can, out of pure spite. Lynn certainly breaks up a number of friendships, {{but it does not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that someone might catch on....|$|R
6000|$|The way {{the snow}} [...] "goes" [...] for that poor woman is most unfair. It always snows much heavier in the {{particular}} spot where she is sitting than it does {{anywhere else in the}} whole street. Why, we have sometimes seen a heroine sitting {{in the midst of a}} blinding snow-storm while the other side of the road was as dry as a bone. And it never seemed <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> cross over.|$|R
6000|$|... "What can {{he want to}} see me about?" [...] exclaimed Mary, {{the truth}} <b>occurring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> only <b>to</b> be chased away as a piece of egregious vanity. It was more {{reasonable}} to suppose that Mr. Dryland had on hand some charitable scheme in which he desired <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take part.|$|R
