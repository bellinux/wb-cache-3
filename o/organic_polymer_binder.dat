40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) route {{based on the}} selective laser sintering (SLS) principle was developed to fabricate ceramic parts. During SLS, 3 D parts are built in an additive way, i. e. layer by layer, without using a mold or die. A 3 D CAD model of the part is virtually sliced into thin sections and the parts are built by depositing powder layers representing these slices. A laser beam is used as heating source to locally heat and sinter the deposited powder layer according to predetermined geometries. The sequence of powder deposition and laser scanning is repeated until the 3 D part is completed. In this work, an indirect SLS approach was adapted using a sacrificial <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>binder</b> phase. A ceramic/binder composite powder {{was used as a}} starting material. Laser irradiation of the composite powder deposit layer aims to melt the organic phase that binds the ceramic particles into a component layer. The green SLS parts were subsequently debinded and sintered to increasedensity and strength of the final ceramic part. The first challenge was to produce micrometer sized polymer/ceramic composite powder which contains submicrometer ceramic particles. An innovative powder preparation technique, thermally induced phase separation (TIPS), was developed to produce such powder. This is a simple technique which involves thedissolution of polymer in a suitable solvent by heating, followed by precipitation of the polymer induced by cooling of the solution. Compositespherical powder was successfully synthesized using TIPS. The effect ofthe polymer concentration, cooling rate, stirring and ceramic powder content and type on the polymer and polymer-ceramic composite microsphereswas investigated. The morphology of the composite powder was found to be strongly determined by the amount and particle size of the ceramic phase. The ceramic particles were incorporated into the precipitating polymer sphere during TIPS when submicrometer or nanosized ceramic particles are added to the polymer solution. Agglomeration of composite micropsheres was not observed, in contrast to pure polymer particles. The size of the composite microspheres decreased when increasing the concentration of ceramic powder in the solution. Different grades of spherical alumina-polypropylene (PP), alumina-polyamide (PA) and zirconia-PP composite powder were synthesized by TIPS for selective laser sintering (SLS). The morphology, microsphere size and thermal properties of the composite powder were analyzed. The effect of the composition of the composite starting powder and SLS parameters on the formability of green SLS partswas studied. Laser scanning parameters like laser power, laser scan spacing and laser scan speed were varied to find an optimum set of parameters. To fabricate green parts with sufficient strength allowing post SLS processing, a high polymer content of 60 or 70 vol. % was required,depending on the particle size of the ceramic starting powder. Moreover, the applied laser energy density had to be accurately controlled within a narrow range. Using lower or higher laser energy density resulted indelaminated parts or parts that were too fragile to handle. Although thefabrication of 3 D green parts was realized using SLS, the density of the parts was poor (36 - 54 %) which resulted in a low sintered Al 2 O 3 or ZrO 2 ceramic density (32 - 50 %). To increase the density, green parts were subjected to pressure infiltration (PI) and/or warm isostatic pressing (WIPing). The application of PI and WIPing increased the homogeneity and density of the composite parts which resulted in a higher sintered alumina and zirconia part density of ~ 90 % of the theoretical density. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} has highlighted that magnesium and its alloys as biodegradable material are highly suitable for biomedical applications. The new material fully degrades into nontoxic elements and offers material properties matching those of human bone tissue. As biomedical implants are rather small and complex in shape, the {{metal injection molding}} (MIM) technique seems to be well suited for the near net shape mass production of such parts. Furthermore, MIM of Mg-alloys is of high interest in further technical fields. This study focusses {{on the performance of}} MIM-processing of magnesium alloy powders. It includes Mg-specific development of powder blending, feedstock preparation, injection molding, solvent and thermal debinding and final sintering. Even though Mg is a highly oxygen-affine material forming a stable oxide layer on each particle surface, the material can be sintered to nearly dense parts, providing mechanical properties matching those of as cast material. An ultimate tensile strength of 142 MPa, yield strength of 67 MPa, elastic modulus of 40 GPa and 8 % elongation at fracture could be achieved using novel <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>binders</b> for the feedstock preparation.

Different approaches have been applied in the attempt to stabilize the Sn cyclablity, such as alloying Sn with other metals (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn and Al etc.), 4 - 7 embedding Sn in conductive carbon substrate, 8, 9 and fabricating nanostructured Sn materials, 10 - 12 etc. Although some progress has been made, pure Sn based electrode still has difficulties to achieve a stable cycling. In this report, pure nano Sn (< 150 nm) was used as active material and a special conductive polymer that we have developed previously was used as binder in this system 13. Fig. 1 a shows the SEM image of nano Sn particles. It can be seen that nano Sn particles form the miro-sized secondary particles, which was confirmed by the particles size analysis (Fig. 1 b). To optimize the composition of electrode, binder content was decreased from 10 % to 2 % by weight. The testing results show that electrode performance is sensitive to the binder content.

This work proposes poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene), PVDF-TrFE, as a <b>polymer</b> <b>binder</b> for C-LiFePO 4 based cathodes and investigates its effect in the electrochemical properties of the cathodes. Morphological, electrical, swelling and electrochemical properties were investigated for this <b>polymer</b> <b>binder</b> and the results were compared with the ones from two other fluoropolymers, poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, and poly(vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene), PVDF-HFP, already reported in the literature as binders for CLiFePO 4 cathodes. It is demonstrated that cathode morphology and electrical conductivity are similar, independently of the <b>polymer</b> <b>binders,</b> but that the swelling values depend on the selected binder. The voltage difference between the two redox peaks of the C-LiFePO 4 based cathodes with PVDF, PVDF-HFP or PVDF-TrFE as binders are 0. 46, 0. 79 and 0. 83 V, respectively. Also, the impedance values show the following order: PVDF < PVDF-HFP ≤ PVDF-TrFE. Finally, the discharge capacities values are 129 mAh. g- 1, 75. 5 mAh g- 1 and 94. 3 mAh. g- 1 for PVDF, PVDF-HFP and PVDF-TrFE binders after 50 cycles at Crate.
