25|$|In the meantime, Japan {{began to}} expand into {{northeast}} China. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regions <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> targeted was Jiandao (known in Korean as Gando).

5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented {{all but a few}} of the U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E

5|$|Chris Woodrich of Gadjah Mada University, meanwhile, {{argues that}} the play is a veiled warning against {{considering}} PETA as a nationalistic. Considering Pane's position at the Cultural Bureau, Woodrich suggests that Pane would have been aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> occupation government's ultimate goal for PETA: to help defend the Indonesian archipelago against the Allies if necessary, a message {{which had to be}} conveyed implicitly owing to Pane's own position and the Japanese occupation government's strict censorship. Woodrich points to Aminah's father, a former employee of the Dutch colonial government, and suggests that the character's protests about joining PETA, seemingly in order to promote the safety and comfort of home, are actually based on an understanding of the colonial mindset and the accompanying manipulation; in-text, these protests can only be conveyed in implicit terms owing to the father's fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> government.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
