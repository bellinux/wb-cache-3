5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E

He was told he [...] "lacked the usual form <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> poetry... and would not study models".

500|$|During the 17th century, {{the smaller}} Mareyeuse type {{was used for}} {{transporting}} fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris, a distance of almost 200 miles, in under 18 hours. [...] This journey is remembered annually in the Route du Poisson race. Only mares pulled small carts full of ice and fish on the relay-style trip. By 1884, the Boulonnais was called the [...] "largest and most valuable <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> horse in France". At that time, {{they were used to}} move heavy blocks of building stone in Paris, with six to eight horses drawing blocks of several tons. During the 20th century, the larger Boulonnais type was utilized by the French army, and highly regarded for its ability to pull artillery and supply wagons. Falling demand for the breed means that today it is bred mainly for horsemeat. In 2010, 60 percent of Boulonnais horses bred in France were intended for slaughter, and 80 percent of these were exported, mainly to Italy, to be fattened before being sent to slaughterhouses. However, the sector is in crisis due to falling prices, controversy and the importation of cheap meat; despite a resurgence following the Mad Cow scares of the 1990s, the consumption of horse meat has fallen sharply, although the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region remains the largest consumer of horse meat in France.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's mother-manager Tina Knowles {{said that}} Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots. While Williams and Rowland were on gospel and {{alternative}} pop, respectively, Beyoncé focused on recording R songs. Songs in the album are varied: from mid-tempo and club-oriented {{tracks in the}} first half, and ballads in the second half. Beyoncé commented: [...] "My album is a good balance of... ballads and... mid-tempos with just ridin'-in-your-car feels, to a lot of... up-tempo club songs, to really sexy songs, to songs {{that make you feel}} emotional. It's a nice mixture of different types of tracks." [...] Although the album contains high-energy songs like [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Naughty Girl", the album's focal mode, however, is slow and moody. Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album. According to Beyoncé, she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range, and by doing so, she blended various genres and musical influences in the album. The album incorporates R, hip hop, soul and reggae influences. The album took hip hop influences from Jay-Z, Outkast, and Lil' Kim; the reggae is from Sean Paul; and courtesy of Storch, the album explores Arabic music. His personal study <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe. Beyoncé and the producers also used a wide array of instrumentations.|$|E

Parisians cut down trees and tore up paving stones to build barricades.
