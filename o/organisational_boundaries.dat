40|$|A {{research}} project {{sponsored by the}} CRC in Construction Innovation recently considered issues concerning knowledge management; in particular, the knowledge interfaces between government agencies and contractors across three state government organisations (including Queensland Department of Main Roads). As projectbased organisations relying extensively upon contractors, organisations such as Main Roads face a difficult environment in respect of knowledge management. There is a degree of knowledge that is required of the various contractors' activities {{to be able to}} efficiently engage with the contractor. The fundamental objective was to consider how to effectively manage the knowledge that resides at the <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary,</b> which is often developed by the contractor, but required by the public sector agency to function effi ciently. The outcomes of the research highlighted that ICT-based systems had severe limitations and that issues pertaining to leadership, organisation culture, organisational structure and internal systems were fundamental and should be the focus of organisations that are looking to move beyond basic documentation...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} facing firms competing in electronic business markets is the dynamic integration of knowledge within {{and beyond the}} firm, enabled by internet-based infrastructure and emergent fluid socio-technical networks. This paper explores how social actors dynamically employ intranets to integrate formal and informal knowledge within evolving socio-technical networks that emerge, permeate and extend beyond the <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary.</b> The paper presents two case studies that illustrate how static intranets can be useful for dynamically integrating knowledge when they are interwoven with other knowledge channels such as e-mail through which flows the informal knowledge needed {{to make sense of}} and situate formal organisational knowledge. The findings suggest that businesses should carefully examine how employees integrate intranets with other channels in their work, and the shaping of knowledge outcomes that flows from such use. There are practical implications for the proper skilling of the people who share and integrate knowledge in this way. The paper also provides a framework for dynamic knowledge integration in socio-technical networks, which can help underpin future research in this area.

40|$|Drawing on the {{concepts}} {{developed in the}} external governance literature this paper argues that {{the conclusion of the}} Schengen Association Agreement symbolises a qualitative change in the bilateral relations between the EU and Switzerland. The argument on the qualitative change in the intensity of relations is developed by comparing the situation in Schengen related matters before and after the conclusion of the Swiss Schengen Association Agreement. Although the regulatory boundary was formally not shifted prior to the conclusion of the Schengen Association Agreement, various forms of policy transfer led to a high degree of policy convergence. In contrast hereto the <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary</b> was only ‘tentatively’ shifted in the pre-Schengen era owing to the fact that Switzerland remained excluded from the key implementation networks (SIS, Dublin). The conclusion of a dynamic integration treaty in Schengen matters shifts the EU’s regulatory boundary towards Switzerland in an unprecedented manner, a process that has been accompanied by a multiplication of possibilities for organisational inclusion. The article concludes by critically reflecting on the limited exportability of this advanced form of ‘flexible integration’...|$|R

The organisation's incentive to enhance operational standardisation increases ceteris paribus with the specification diversity among the units within the organisation under certain conditions. Units within an organisation are less prone to acquire new units, the more the mean specification preference of inside units deviates from the mean specification preference of non-acquired units for specification that {{can be expected to}} become standardised subsequently. Conversely, inside units are more likely to acquire new units before choosing collaboration, the more mean specification preference of inside units deviates from the mean preference of non-acquired units for specifications that have already been harmonised. organisational structure; acquisitions; collaboration; extended firms; operational specification diversity; market; hierarchy; widening; deepening two-period game; discounting; hybrid enterprises; enterprise structures...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with furthering {{an understanding of the}} behaviour of <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary</b> personnel, or more exactly, with how boundaries act as psychological environments. The study has two complementary aims: to describe the psychological environment encountered by boundary personnel and to offer a theoretical model of the organisation as a psychological environment, the latter being a prerequisite of the former. It is held that a social psychological perspective is needed which can deal adequately with organisations as antecedent conditions of behaviour, and that situational analysis offers a useful social psychological framework for this purpose. The empirical investigation is an initial descriptive study of the psychological environment encountered by boundary personnel. It is argued that initial descriptive studies are necessary when dealing with largely unstudied phenomena, and that this stage in the scientific process has often been undervalued by social psychologists. A diary analysis followed by interviews were used to elicit a range of situations encountered by boundary personnel having direct and frequent contact with customers and clients. Four organisations were studied, each having a different primary task. A self-completion questionnaire was administered to elicit judgemental data, using the situations as stimuli. Multidimensional scaling was applied to analyse the data, treated as four sub-sets. This yielded the dimensions underlying each data set and the representation of situations according to these dimensions in each case. The results suggest that three common dimensions (formality, anxiety and socio-emotionality) underlie the cognitive representations of boundary personnel, and that the psychological environment encountered is complex. A taxonomy of situations is constructed and several important hypotheses relating to the psychological environment of boundary personnel formulated. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{circular}} economy has major implications for how current supply chains are organised. They {{need to be}} transformed into circular value chains, in which companies collaborate to effectively manage complete product value cycles, consisting of the creation, preservation, exploitation and restoration of product embodied values. Earlier research has identified {{some of the major}} obstacles to make this transformation come true, but little guidance is provided in how these new circular systems are organised, operated and managed. This thesis contributes filling in this knowledge gap, by the means of creating and testing a theoretical framework comprising the inter-organisational resources and capabilities of a circular value chain. The framework draws upon existing literature from the fields of traditional and sustainable supply chain management, operations- and information management and covers three domains: <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions, operational resources and managerial capabilities. The validity of the framework was put to the test by collecting empirical data from semi-structured interviews with experts and employees from pioneering companies in a {{circular economy}}. The analysis of this data resulted in a further exploration of the framework’s contained elements, and their relevance to a circular economy. It was found, among other observations, that the existence of trust and a culture of transparency are two very important boundary conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated engineering technologies can greatly improve the circularity of the value chain, while advanced information technologies can improve the relationships and make management easier. Finally, collaboration in the value chain succeeds when partners can identify what extra value is gained by it and when they {{have found a way to}} share in this value. Many of the framework’s elements are interconnected and thus the transformation depends on the interplay of all those resources and capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Whilst many {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} (M&As) are conducted in order to acquire another firm’s knowledge base, the speed of integration {{is crucial to the}} success of any M&A as this stage causes considerable disruption to the organisation which can lead to the failure of any merger or acquisition. Facilitating the free flow of knowledge across the <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary</b> between the acquired and acquiring firm can help integrate the two knowledge bases more effectively and lead to the creation of new knowledge. Effective Knowledge Management (KM) is crucial to this process and KM tools and techniques can have added benefit in the field of M&As. As the majority of organisational knowledge is tacit and cannot be articulated, effective processes need to be implemented to enable tacit knowledge transfer across the boundary between groups and individuals. Communities of Practise (CoPs) can provide the key here to unlocking the value of M&As which will lead to better integration of the two firms. As the informal structure of CoPs easily allows interaction and collaboration between the acquired and acquiring unit, such a tool can facilitate the free dissemination of knowledge across a newly merged organisation which can help integrate the workforce and amalgamate the two knowledge bases. The success of the adoption of KM principles, tools and techniques by newly merged organisations is dependent on the effective management of the human resources during this change period. Employee resistance needs to be minimised here by addressing barriers to integration and barriers to knowledge sharing. Only once these barriers have been addressed can efforts be directed towards creating enabling conditions that will maximise the success of a KM initiative in a newly merged organisation through the development of CoPs...|$|R
40|$|To {{date the}} {{management}} of state-maintained special schools for children with hearing impairment (SMSSCHI) in Ghana has not been extensively researched. As a result, the way such schools are managed is inadequately understood. This research sought to address that lack of understanding. The {{aim of the research}} was to examine the nature of the day-to-day management activities in SMSSCHI to refine our current understanding of such schools. Research questions focused {{on the nature of the}} day-to-day management; the organisational challenges; the relationships between the SMSSCHI and stakeholders including, the private sector, parents and the Ghana Education Service (GES); the way educational policies influence {{the management of}} SMSSCHI; and the boundary issues in the day-to-day management of SSMCHI in Ghana. The research began with an analysis of the relevant literature. The empirical research was in two phases: Phase 1 involved visits to seven out of the 12 SMSSCHI in Ghana to understand day-to-day management practices. Phase 2 explored the relationships between schools and stakeholders in the day-to-day management of SMSSCHI in three schools. The data were analysed using the planning, organising, staffing, coordinating, reporting, budgeting (POSDCoRB) framework. The key findings were that day-to-day management practices were homogenous across study schools. This homogeneity stemmed from the use of centralized planning emanating from the GES to ensure conformity to set policies. This practice led to a limited adoption of strategic plans to address local needs. <b>Organisational</b> <b>boundary</b> issues emerged as significant in relation to the involvement of stakeholders in school management portrayed by the profound influence of the GES and very minimal involvement of other stakeholders as enshrined in the decentralisation policy of the GES. Societal conceptions of disability and the location of special schools influenced stakeholders' involvement in school management.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose that a form of {{communities}} of practice (CoP), a community of innovation (CoInv), is the best support for sustainable innovation. It aims to outline a method for identifying champions of innovation in organisation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on extant research to argue that innovation is facilitated and supported by innovation champions, who have most influence outside traditional organisational structures when they are members of a close-knit community - a CoInv. A potential method for identification of champions of innovation is highlighted. Findings - Innovation champions are special people, with particular personality types and psychological profiles. In order to succeed in championing innovations in organisations they need both procedural and resource support, and social and cognitive support. The influence of innovation champions comes through social contacts, multiplied through the communities in which they participate, through the genuine esteem in which they are held. Developing CoInv around such champions makes practical sense for organisations. Originality/value - Identifying champions of innovation will permit a CoInv to form that links social networks and transcends <b>organisational</b> internal <b>boundaries</b> and forming such a community will potentially trigger more successfully supported innovations. ...|$|R
