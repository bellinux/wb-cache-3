5|$|Trade unionists Vernon Hartshorn and George Barker were vocal {{supporters}} of the suffrage movement, while James Grant a socialist propagandist and keen seller of The Suffragette was imprisoned for five days after being arrested for obstruction while lecturing in Treorchy Square. Mary Keating Hill, a forty-year <b>old</b> <b>wife</b> of a Cardiff insurance manager, spent three weeks in jail for resisting the police and disorderly conduct. She {{had been given a}} similar conviction days prior but her brother paid the fine; but she was determined to be imprisoned. On 21 November 1911, after the failure of the Conciliation Bill, anger spilled over into direct action and 223 suffragettes were arrested during a campaign of window smashing. Among the arrests were seven women with Welsh connections, including Edith Mansell Moullin, Mildred Mansell, the sister of Ivor Guest, MP, and Janet Boyd, sister of Sybil Thomas.|$|E
25|$|After {{his beloved}} 33-year <b>old</b> <b>wife</b> Bella died in September 1870 of {{complications}} from {{the birth of their}} seventh child, Kemper's political activities increased. Distraught from the loss, he no longer slept in the house they had shared, but in his law office. Kemper ran for Congress in the 7th Congressional District (after the redistricting caused by the 1870 census), but lost to incumbent John T. Harris of Harrisonburg.|$|E
2500|$|Much like a contract, express trusts {{are usually}} formed {{based on the}} {{expressed}} intentions {{of a person who}} owns some property to in future have it managed by a trustee, and used for another person's benefit. Often the courts see cases where people have recently died, and expressed a wish to use property for another person, but have not used legal terminology. In principle, this does not matter. In Paul v Constance, Mr Constance had recently split up with his wife, and began to live with Ms Paul, who he played bingo with. Because of their close relationship, Mr Constance had often repeated that the money in his bank account, partly from bingo winnings and from a workplace accident, was [...] "as much yours as mine". When Mr Constance died, his <b>old</b> <b>wife</b> claimed the money still belonged to her, but the Court of Appeal held that despite the lack of formal wording, and though Mr Constance had retained the legal title to the money, it was held on trust for him and Ms Paul. As Scarman LJ put it, they understood [...] "very well indeed their own domestic situation", and even though legal terms were not used in substance this did [...] "convey clearly a present declaration that the existing fund was as much" [...] belonging to Ms Paul. As Lord Millett later put it, if someone [...] "enters into arrangements which have the effect of creating a trust, it is not necessary that [...] he should appreciate that they do so." [...] The only thing {{that needs to be done}} further is that, if the settlor is not declaring herself or himself as the trustee, the property should be physically transferred to the new trustee for the trust to be properly [...] "constituted". The traditional reason for requiring a transfer of property to the trustee was that the doctrine of consideration demanded that property should be passed, and not just promised at some future date, unless something of value was given in return. The general trend in more recent cases, though is to be flexible in these requirements, because as Lord Browne-Wilkinson said, equity [...] "will not strive officiously to defeat a gift".|$|E

When Dabasir later tells the <b>oldest</b> <b>wife</b> that he's not really a slave but a free man, she protests that he cannot call himself a free man when his {{financial}} weakness has brought him to such ruin, that he must have the soul of a slave within him. Dabasir protests and begins to live apart from the other slaves, to demonstrate that he wants to right what he did wrong, that he has the soul of a free man.

60|$|And in {{the second}} year I did this: I {{despatched}} the <b>old</b> <b>wife,</b> Atoua, disguised as a seller of simples, to Alexandria, bidding her seek out Charmion, and, if yet she found her faithful, reveal to her the secret of my way of life. So she went, and in the fifth month from her sailing returned, bearing Charmion's greetings and a token. And {{she told me that she}} had found means to see Charmion, and, in talk, had let fall the name of Harmachis, speaking of me as one dead; at which Charmion, unable to control her grief, wept aloud. Then, reading her heart--for the <b>old</b> <b>wife</b> was very clever, and held the key of knowledge--she told her that Harmachis yet lived, and sent her greetings. Thereon Charmion wept yet more with joy, and kissed the <b>old</b> <b>wife,</b> and made her gifts, bidding her tell me that she had kept her vow, and waited for my coming and the hour of vengeance. So, having learned many secrets, Atoua returned again to Tápé.|$|E
