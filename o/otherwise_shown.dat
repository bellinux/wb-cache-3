The format changed slightly from 2007; the episode aired as its own special on Idols regular Wednesday results night with an early start time of 7:30 p.m. EDT (when stations would've <b>otherwise</b> <b>shown</b> local programming), running for 152 minutes from the Kodak Theatre and the regular Idol stage. The results show aired separately that Thursday. Vignettes showing celebrities visiting impoverished areas in the United States as well as Africa were again shown in between performances. Producers hoped to exceed last year's $76 million raised. Again, proceeds went to children's charities in Africa and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, CBS {{struck a}} deal with Yahoo! to offer live {{streaming}} of the first three rounds of games under its Yahoo! Platinum service, for $16.95 a month. In 2004, CBS began selling viewers access to March Madness On Demand, which provided games not <b>otherwise</b> <b>shown</b> on broadcast television; the service was free for AOL subscribers. In 2006, March Madness On Demand was made free, and continued to be so to online users through the 2011 tournament. For 2012, it once again became a pay service, with a single payment of $3.99 providing access to all 67 tournament games. In 2013, the service, now renamed March Madness Live, was again made free, but uses Turner's rights and infrastructure for TV Everywhere, which requires sign-in though the password of a customer's cable or satellite provider to watch games, both via PC/Mac and mobile devices. Those that do not have a cable or satellite service or one not participating in Turner's TV Everywhere are restricted to games carried on the CBS national feed, the national semifinals and final (regardless of the broadcaster), and three hours (originally four) of other games without sign-in, or coverage via Westwood One's radio coverage.|$|E

Mark Brown from Wired UK classified the game as a [...] "brassy, super-short, cubic heist drama," [...] and stated that Chung [...] "spins a memorable yarn, delivers it with confidence and panache [...] with a 15-year-old engine, without voice acting, in 20 minutes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} {{deliberations}} over the appropriate British {{response to the}} capture of the diplomats, there was concern that Napoleon III would {{take advantage of a}} Union-British war to act against British interests in [...] "Europe or elsewhere". French and British interests clashed in Indochina, in building the Suez Canal, in Italy, and in Mexico. [...] Palmerston saw French stockpiling of coal in the West Indies as indicating France was preparing for war with Britain.

2500|$|On 11 November 1853 the Canterbury Provincial Council, {{apparently}} {{unaware that}} Campbell {{had already been}} removed from the land commissionerships (probably because Campbell took no action to relinquish office while he appealed to the Governor), adopted the following resolution agreeing to ask the Governor of New Zealand to remove Campbell from office:"This Council, having taken into account the various papers upon their table in reference to the proceedings of the Commissioner of Crown Lands: resolve; [...] That the Commissioner of Crown Lands, having as it appears to this Council, acted in disregard of the law, and having refused to afford this Council any information on the affairs of his office, and having <b>otherwise</b> <b>shown</b> himself wholly incompetent to the discharge of the duties thereof, an address be presented from this Council to His Excellency the Governor, praying His Excellency to be pleased to remove Colonel Campbell from the office of Commissioner of Crown Lands." ...|$|E

Nothing is so manifest in every face by him, as its gentleness and rest. Secondly, to finish his work perfectly, and in such temper that the angels might say of it--not he himself--'Iste perfecit opus.' Do you remember what I told you in the Eagle's Nest (§ 53), that true humility was in hoping that angels might sometimes admire our work; not in hoping that we should ever be able to admire theirs? Thirdly,--a little thing it seems, but was a great one,--love of flowers. No one draws such lilies or such daisies as Lippi. Botticelli beat him afterwards in roses, but never in lilies. Fourthly, due honor for classical tradition. Lippi is the only religious painter who dresses John Baptist in the camelskin, as the Greeks dressed Heracles in the lion's--over the head. Lastly, and chiefly of all,--Le Père Hyacinthe taught his pupil certain views about the doctrine of the Church, which the boy thought of more deeply than his tutor, and that by a great deal; and Master Sandro presently got himself into such question for painting heresy, that if he had been as hot-headed as he was true-hearted, he would soon have come to bad end by the tar-barrel. But he is so sweet and so modest, that nobody is frightened; so clever, that everybody is pleased: and at last, actually the Pope sends for him to paint his own private chapel,--where the first thing my young gentleman does, mind you, is to paint the devil in a monk's dress, tempting Christ! The sauciest thing, out and out, done {{in the history of the}} Reformation, it seems to me; yet so wisely done, and with such true respect <b>otherwise</b> <b>shown</b> for what was sacred in the Church, that the Pope didn't mind: and all went on as merrily as marriage bells.|$|E
