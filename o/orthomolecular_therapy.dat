2500|$|Similarly, the American Cancer Society {{comments}} {{that the current}} scientific evidence does not [...] "support use of <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> {{for most of the}} conditions for which it is promoted." [...] Some supplements have exhibited benefits for specific conditions, while a few have been confirmed to be harmful; the consumption of nutritious foods is the best recognized method to obtain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients crucial for good health. Barrie Cassileth, an adviser on alternative medicine to the National Institutes of Health, stated that [...] "scientific research has found no benefit from <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> for any disease," [...] and medical textbooks also report that there is [...] "no evidence that megavitamin or <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> is effective in treating any disease." ...|$|E
50|$|CCNM teaches naturopathic medicine, {{which is}} not {{compatible}} with evidence-based medicine and is potentially ineffective and dangerous.

25|$|Other {{members of}} the medical {{community}} deny {{the existence of such}} an institutional prejudice. A review in the Journal of Clinical Oncology denied that physicians collude against unconventional treatments. Despite claims of conspiracy, the Linus Pauling Institute's funding comes primarily from the National Institutes of Health, and in 1995 some <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapies</b> were reported as being sanctioned in Japan.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Orthomolecular</b> <b>therapies</b> {{have been}} criticized as lacking a {{sufficient}} evidence base for clinical use: their scientific foundations are too weak, the {{studies that have been}} performed are too few and too open to interpretation, and reported positive findings in observational studies are contradicted by the results of more rigorous clinical trials. Accordingly, [...] "there is no evidence that orthomolecular medicine is effective". Proponents of orthomolecular medicine strongly dispute this statement by citing studies demonstrating the effectiveness of treatments involving vitamins, though this ignores the belief that a normal diet will provide adequate nutrients to avoid deficiencies, and that orthomolecular treatments are not actually related to vitamin deficiency. The lack of scientifically rigorous testing of orthomolecular medicine has led to its practices being classed with other forms of alternative medicine and regarded as unscientific. It has been described as food faddism and quackery, with critics arguing that it is based upon an [...] "exaggerated belief in the effects of nutrition upon health and disease." [...] Orthomolecular practitioners will often use dubious diagnostic methods to define what substances are [...] "correct"; one example is hair analysis, which produces spurious results when used in this fashion.|$|R

40|$|<b>Orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> has {{had much}} support and much opposition, {{and yet there}} remain a number of {{professionals}} and parents who continue the quest for its effective application in the amelioration of psychiatric disorders. The popular press has again been the forum for heated debate between those who debunk its possibilities and those who attest to its operative use. Because the parents of mentally retarded and mentally ill children are particularly vulnerable to the raising or dashing of their hopes against claims being made either way, this paper provides an overview and history of <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy,</b> its application to both mental illness and mental retardation, as well as toxicity considerations relative to megavitamin treatment, {{in the hope that}} such information will provide mental health professionals with concise an swers to the challenging questions currently being asked by their patients...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 41) Schizophrenia, {{a disease}} affecting {{nearly as many}} persons {{in this country as}} live in the State of California, is considered by many experts in the mental health field to be a multimodal condition for which traditional kinds of psychotherapy have been nonresultant. Out of the need for a successful treatment for the vast number of people affected by this disease, two fairly recent new therapeutic measures have developed. Family therapy and <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> both had their inception during the early 1950 's; both were an outgrowth of traditional psychiatry. This research attempts to discover basic principles and treatment methods of family therapy, a social approach; and of <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy,</b> a biochemical approach in an effort to determine whether the two might reasonably be joined together in adjunctive therapy for the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|E
5000|$|Vonnegut first {{attributed}} {{his recovery}} to <b>orthomolecular</b> megavitamin <b>therapy</b> and then wrote The Eden Express. However, {{it should be}} pointed out that in this book, he states that [...] "approximately a third - improve without any treatment. Whatever shrink happens to be standing around when such remissions occur is usually willing to assume credit" [...] pg. 267. From the book, one can see that he was trying to decide if it is the therapy or the ever changing medications that are the most effective for treatment. Vonnegut does not presently attribute his recovery to vitamins. In reality, such situations take years of trial and error treatment to figure out what actually is effective treatment since the diagnostic tools are based on statistics (a group of symptoms and how long they last and what is the age of the patient) making them inherently weak on predictably. This is made worse given the short duration of any treatment because of the prohibitive costs of longer term productive treatment. He subsequently studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and later came to the conclusion that he actually had bipolar disorder. He is currently a pediatrician in Quincy, Massachusetts.|$|R
40|$|Learning disabilities {{constitute}} {{the most prevalent}} and urgent medical problem afflicting children {{not only in the}} United States but in most countries of the world. The number of children involved is staggering when one considers that 5 percent of the nonretarded children population is affected. Physicians must be made aware that a child suffering from learning disabilities will not "outgrow it, " that his condition is not "a phase he is passing through. " If adequate intervention is not made into these disabilities, the child's potential will never be realized and the effects on his life will be more devastating than those of most other childhood disorders with which he might be afflicted. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the more rewarding will be the response to <b>Orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> or to pharmacotherapy and hence the more successful the results of remedial effort. Delayed diagnosis or treatment exposes the child to improper assessment by school personnel, his peers, and his parents, increasing the probability of permanent psychological damage. Recent research suggests that learning disabilities are associated with minimal brain dysfunction. This term refers to children of near-or above-average intelligence, with certain learning or behavioral disabilities, ranging from mild to severe, which are associated wit...|$|E
40|$|The {{functioning}} of the brain {{is affected by the}} molecular concentrations of many substances that are normally present in the brain. The optimum concentrations of these substances for a person may differ greatly from the concentrations provided by his normal diet and genetic machinery. Biochemical and ge-netic arguments support the idea that <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy,</b> the provision for the individual person of the optimum concen-trations of important normal constituents of the brain, may be the preferred treatment for many mentally ill patients. Mental symptoms of avitaminosis sometimes are observed long before any physical symptoms appear. It is likely that the brain is more sensitive to changes in concentration of vital substances than are other organs and tissues ”[1]. Humans are parasites of the planet. In order to sur-vive, there are minerals and molecules, ultraviolet waves, and other organisms on which we rely. We need some of Earth’s resources to function optimally and in some cases, we need them to function at all. These nutrients on which we rely are considered essential nutrients if they are used by most hu-mans most of the time. The mid-twentieth century was a fertile time for nutrition research, during which time a lot of feeding studies were taking place on what are now known as essential nutrients. Today, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) maintains an information database of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients developed by th...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Linus Pauling {{incorporated}} hemoglobin and {{a disease}} of the blood, sickle cell anemia, into many of his researches between the mid- 1930 s and mid- 1970 s. In the early 1930 s Pauling became interested in organic chemistry and named hemoglobin {{as one of the}} first biochemical substances that he planned to analyze. In 1935 he published his first paper on hemoglobin, which determined the structure of the four hemes in hemoglobin. Pauling continued to study the structure of hemoglobin until the early 1950 s when he proposed that it was an alpha-helix. In 1945 Pauling learned about sickle cell anemia and published an important paper in 1949 with Harvey A. Itano, S. J. Singer, and Ibert C. Wells titled "Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease. " Pauling investigated hemoglobin into the mid- 1970 s when he tried to find an <b>orthomolecular</b> <b>therapy</b> for sickle cell anemia. From the mid- 1950 s to early 1970 s, Pauling also used sickle cell anemia to promote negative eugenics, point out the possible mutagenic effects caused by nuclear weapons testing, and propose an evolutionary theory. Additionally, in the final year of his life, Pauling wrote two forewords for books on sickle cell anemia, which were published in 1994, the year he died. Hemoglobin and sickle cell anemia can be considered a theme within Pauling's work. He often returned to normal and abnormal hemoglobin as his primary substance for examination, and his familiarity with hemoglobin and sickle cell anemia inspired new research...|$|E
