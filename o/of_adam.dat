5|$|The {{gatehouse}} is a two-storied, 17th century {{building with}} exposed timber and plasterwork, constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style. It features elaborate wooden carvings {{on the exterior}} and interior doorways, including angels, the biblical characters <b>of</b> <b>Adam,</b> Eve and the serpent from the Garden of Eden, as well as dragons and other nude figures. It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} set in a shed {{enclosed}} by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like grisaille. Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure (atlante) at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues <b>of</b> <b>Adam</b> and Eve– Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are <b>of</b> <b>Adam</b> and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of Cain and Abel: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the Land of Nod.|$|E
5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services <b>of</b> <b>Adam</b> van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze <b>of</b> <b>Adam,</b> the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation <b>of</b> <b>Adam</b> is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E

50|$|Settlement began around 1800 at Adams village. David Smith built a sawmill at {{the present}} site <b>of</b> <b>Adams</b> in 1801. Renamed for John Adams in 1802 (the year after his {{presidency}} ended), the Town <b>of</b> <b>Adams</b> was created from the survey townships of Aleppo and Orpheus. The eastern part <b>of</b> <b>Adams</b> was taken in 1804 to form the Town of Rodman.

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall <b>of</b> <b>Adam</b> and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>Adam</b> Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland.

Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, the Swedish concept {{designer}} Niklas Jansson {{created an}} adaptation of Michelangelo's The Creation <b>of</b> <b>Adam,</b> superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God.

The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called The Flying Spaghetti Monster Holiday Pageant in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The production has spawned a sequel called Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy Mug of Grog, performed in December 2008. This communal activity {{attracted the attention of}} three University of Florida religious scholars, who assembled a panel at the 2007 American Academy of Religion meeting to discuss the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
