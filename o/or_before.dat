5|$|According to Edward Trollope, {{the oldest}} {{tombstone}} {{in the church}} was from the 13th century; it was faded and illegible when he recorded it in <b>or</b> <b>before</b> 1872. A 14th-century slab, originally for a now-lost effigy, is in the church, and brass plate {{from the same period}} was discovered during the 1853 restoration. Richard Dokke, along with his wife Joanna and son John, are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s, and a plaque to William Harebeter and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset <b>or</b> <b>before</b> sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity <b>or</b> <b>before</b> they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|Breton died on <b>or</b> <b>before</b> 12 May 1275, {{when the}} {{custodian}} of the bishopric was given orders to seize Breton's estate because of debts {{owed to the}} king.

According to Font, the eldest child Sophia was born in <b>or</b> <b>before</b> 1100. In 1101 Sophia was followed by twin brothers Stephen and Ladislaus.

5|$|Of the pardoned mutineers, Heywood and Morrison {{returned}} to naval duty. Heywood acquired the patronage of Hood and, by 1803 {{at the age}} of 31, had achieved the rank of captain. After a distinguished career, he died in 1831. Morrison became a master gunner, and was eventually lost in 1807 when HMS Blenheim foundered in the Indian Ocean. Muspratt is believed to have worked as a naval steward before his death, in <b>or</b> <b>before</b> 1798. The other principal participants in the court martial—Fryer, Peckover, Coleman, McIntosh and others—generally vanished from the public eye after the closing of the procedures.|$|E
