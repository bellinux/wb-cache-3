40|$|AbstractAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are {{ubiquitous}} {{and ancient}} enzymes, mostly {{known for their}} essential role in generating aminoacylated tRNAs. During the last two decades, many aaRSs {{have been found to}} perform additional and equally crucial tasks <b>outside</b> <b>translation.</b> In metazoans, aaRSs have been shown to assemble, together with non-enzymatic assembly proteins called aaRSs-interacting multifunctional proteins (AIMPs), into so-called multi-synthetase complexes (MSCs). Metazoan MSCs are dynamic particles able to specifically release some of their constituents in response to a given stimulus. Upon their release from MSCs, aaRSs can reach other subcellular compartments, where they often participate to cellular processes that do not exploit their primary function of synthesizing aminoacyl-tRNAs. The dynamics of MSCs and the expansion of the aaRSs functional repertoire are features that are so far thought to be restricted to higher and multicellular eukaryotes. However, much can be learnt about how MSCs are assembled and function from apparently ‘simple’ organisms. Here we provide an overview on the diversity of these MSCs, their composition, mode of assembly and the functions that their constituents, namely aaRSs and AIMPs, exert in unicellular organisms...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: {{quantitative}} research, qualitative research, ethnography, discourse analysis, participant observation, inter-disciplinarityTrekking {{further into}} context: exploring {{the relation between}} translators’/interpreters’ practices and their discourses Panel: Veerle Duflou, (University College Ghent, Belgium); Fernando Ferreira Alves (Universidado do Minho, Braga, Portugal); Peter Flynn – moderator (Lessius University College, Antwerp, Belgium); Heidi Salaets, Lessius University College, Antwerp, Belgium). Research within Translation Studies has become increasingly context oriented. Though norm theory is eminently sociological in its theoretical underpinnings (Pym in Pym, Shlesinger & Jettmarová, 2006 : 3), researchers were slow to move beyond textual sources (Toury, 1995 : 65) in search of evidence of normative translational behaviour, text being understood here as also including oral output in interpreting. The need for a different form of analysis first arose {{in the field of}} community interpreting research, but context oriented approaches have also proved fruitful for the study of other forms of translational or interpreting activity. Theoretically, explanatory links have been established between text/utterance {{on the one hand and}} context (viz. translation and norms (Chesterman 1993, Toury 1995,), regimes (Pym 1998), habitus (Gouanvic 2005, Sela-Sheffy 2005, Simeoni 1998) and sociology (Gouanvic 1997, Wolf 2006, Wolf & Fukari 2007, inter alia.) on the other hand. Empirical studies have drawn on sources from libraries and archives and more recently on on-line surveys (Katan, Pöchhacker & Zwischenberger, 2009) 9 and (ethnographic) fieldwork (Inghilleri 2003, 2005, Angelleli 2004, Koskinen 2008, among many others) in the search for patterns in / explanations for translational practices. The work of all of the scholars mentioned so far demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of Translation Studies in the way they draw on approaches, research methodologies and assumptions from <b>outside</b> <b>Translation</b> Studies proper. This in turn has raised debate about how much of any given discipline a researcher should be acquainted with, next to translation studies, in order to arrive at productive results in translation research (see, for example, Pym’s debate on the sociology of translation in Pym, Shlesinger & Jettmarová, 20006 : 4 - 6). Such interdisciplinary exchanges and debates are essential, if we wish to acquire a fuller picture of translating or interpreting as situated practices and hence further develop and fine-tune our models for describing and analysing translation not just as a language phenomenon alone but also as a social phenomenon. The panel we propose plans to address more specifically the role of stances and positionings found in translators’ and interpreters’ discourses within the whole of translation/interpreting practices. The fundamental question underlying this is: how are we to understand this relation? We believe that surveys, participant observation and in-depth interviews can allow us to gain insight into and outline (embodied) stances and positionings with regard to translational and interpreting activities and thereby provide a essential complement to the information a comparative analysis of data from translational and interpretive exchanges can provide us information on translational strategies and tactics. Without wishing to deny the importance of studying translations as such, we would like to focus in the main on the translatorial side of the proposition. We argue that this relation between the translational and the translatorial is not of a falsifiable nature to the extent that practices may be shown to contradict positionings and vice versa. 9 The following three papers discussed the findings of on-line surveys into translators and interpreters: David Katan, University of Salento, Translation theory and professional practice: A global survey of the Great Divide; Franz Pöchhacker, University of Vienna, Conference Interpreting: Surveying the profession; Cornelia Zwischenberger, University of Vienna, Web-based surveying among conference interpreters: Methodology and application. All three papers were delivered during “Profession, identity and status: translators and interpreters as an occupational group" a research workshop held by the Israeli Science Foundation in Tel Aviv March 15 - 19 2009 150 We would also argue against considering translatorial discourse merely as half-remembered ad-hoc rationalisations of practice or expressions of semi-conscious strategies. Rather we would like to suggest that the two avenues of conceptualisation (translational and translatorial and the subsequent research issuing from them), though useful in terms of method and approach to forms of data, prevent us from conceiving of translation or interpreting as a holistic event, not just the sum of its scholarly parts (see Hanks 1996 : 14 on practice). We argue that it is from within this holistic framework that we can best understand the relation between translatorial discourse and translational practice and hence translating or interpreting. Each of the speakers in the panel will address the main topic from the perspective of his/her research interests and methods, with a view to shedding light on basic aspects of the holistic framework mentioned above. In this regard, each will highlight the difficulties encountered and the benefits gained from conducting a particular line of research. Following each speaker’s outline, an attempt will be made to combine the various insights and make suggestions for a further explicitation of the relation between translational practices and translatorial discourse. Our basic stance here is that understanding translation/interpreting phenomena and more specifically the relation between text and context will always involve an interdisciplinary engagement with a variety of research methodologies along with their basic assumptions regarding meaning making. Translation is understood as being set within the scope of the so-called technical-intellectual labour, developed in a complex network system (Strauss, 1987) within a specific “community of practice" (Wenger, 1999) including both people and institutions involved in the production of “immaterial and incorporeal goods" (Heilbron and Sapiro, 2007). Given the complex nature of translation and interpreting as a holistic socio-cultural event involving language(s), no single discipline can offer a complete picture. References Angelelli, Claudia V.

As {{the focus is on the}} departments of the company <b>outside</b> the <b>translation</b> department, it gives a picture of the additional workload that employees have in their daily routines. The framework is created by using existing literature and interview data to form a picture of translation activities as a phenomenon. The interview data also lead towards finding the main effects of translation activities on the employees. Research method and data: Various interviews were conducted to form a picture of the work routines of the employees and to see how translation activities are present in them. Three forms of interviews took place, namely individual interviews, a group discussion, and a focus group. These interviews were used as the main source of information. In addition, secondary data were used to form a general picture of language issues in the academic world. Results: Many translation activities take place <b>outside</b> the <b>translation</b> department. Some employees perceive it as a part of their work that they cannot control, others feel that the additional work coming from translation activities is a burden, and some see it as a welcome addition to their daily routines. Social networking is a way to solve problems related to translation activities in addition to technical tools. Employees are concerned most by the quality of their translations and the time consumption.

40|$|Three base pairs in the T-stem are {{primarily}} responsible for the sequence-specific interaction of tRNA with Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu. While the amino acids {{on the surface of}} EF-Tu that contact aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) are highly conserved among bacteria, the T-stem sequences of individual tRNA are variable, making it unclear whether or not this protein–nucleic acid interaction is also sequence specific in other bacteria. We propose and validate a thermodynamic model that predicts the ΔG° of any tRNA to EF-Tu using the sequence of its three T-stem base pairs. Despite dramatic differences in T-stem sequences, the predicted ΔG° values for the majority of tRNA classes are similar in all bacteria and closely match the ΔG° values determined for E. coli tRNAs. Each individual tRNA class has evolved to have a characteristic ΔG° value to EF-Tu, but different T-stem sequences are used to achieve this ΔG° value in different bacteria. Thus, the compensatory relationship between the affinity of the tRNA body and the affinity of the esterified amino acid is universal among bacteria. Additionally, we predict and validate a small number of aa-tRNAs that bind more weakly to EF-Tu than expected and thus are candidates for acting as activated amino acid donors in processes <b>outside</b> of <b>translation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Termination of {{translation}} in eukaryotes requires two release factors, eRF 1, which recognizes all three nonsense codons and facilitates {{release of the}} nascent polypeptide chain, and eRF 3 stimulating translation termination in a GTP-depended manner. eRF 3 from different organisms possess a highly conservative C region (eRF 3 C), {{which is responsible for}} the function in translation termination, and almost always contain the N-terminal extension, which is inessential and vary both in structure and length. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the N-terminal region of eRF 3 is responsible for conversion of this protein into the aggregated and functionally inactive prion form. Results Here, we examined functional importance of the N-terminal region of a non-prion form of yeast eRF 3. The screen for mutations which are lethal in combination with the SUP 35 -C allele encoding eRF 3 C revealed the sup 45 mutations which alter the N-terminal domain of eRF 1 and increase nonsense codon readthrough. However, further analysis showed that synthetic lethality was not caused by the increased levels of nonsense codon readthrough. Dominant mutations in SUP 35 -C were obtained and characterized, which remove its synthetic lethality with the identified sup 45 mutations, thus indicating that synthetic lethality was not due to a disruption of interaction with proteins that bind to this eRF 3 region.

40|$|Abstract Background Termination of {{translation}} in eukaryotes {{is controlled by}} two interacting polypeptide chain release factors, eRF 1 and eRF 3. While eRF 1 recognizes nonsense codons, eRF 3 facilitates polypeptide chain release from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Besides termination, both release factors have essential, but poorly characterized functions <b>outside</b> of <b>translation.</b> Results To characterize further the functions of yeast eRF 1 and eRF 3, a genetic screen for their novel partner proteins was performed. As a result, the genes for γ (TEF 4 and TEF 3 /CAM 1) and α (TEF 5 / EFB 1) subunits of the translation elongation factor eEF 1 B, known to catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on eEF 1 A, were revealed. These genes act as dosage suppressors of a synthetic growth defect caused by some mutations in the SUP 45 and SUP 35 genes encoding eRF 1 and eRF 3, respectively. Extra copies of TEF 5 and TEF 3 can also suppress the temperature sensitivity of some sup 45 and sup 35 mutants and reduce nonsense codon readthrough caused by these omnipotent suppressors. Besides, overproduction of eEF 1 Bα reduces nonsense codon readthrough in the strain carrying suppressor tRNA. Such effects were not shown for extra copies of TEF 2, which encodes eEF 1 A, thus indicating {{that they were not}} due to eEF 1 A activation. Conclusion The data obtained demonstrate involvement of the translation elongation factor eEF 1 B in modulating the functions {{of translation}} termination factors and suggest its possible role in GDP for GTP exchange on eRF 3. </p...|$|R

The core idea is to keep the ambiguity of the Arabic segmentation in the system input (using confusion networks or lattices). Then, we hope that the best segmentation will be chosen during MT decoding. The mathematics of this multiple segmentation approach are given.

An important question associated with the proposition persists, however, regarding the kind of equivalence that underlies the stated notion of ‘sameness’.

Here, we studied the transcription factor superfamily AP 2 /ERF, particularly, RAP 2. 4 from Carica papaya cv. Maradol. We isolated four genes (CpRap 2. 4 a, CpRAap 2. 4 b, CpRap 2. 1 and CpRap 2. 10), and an in silico analysis showed that the four genes encode proteins that contain a conserved APETALA 2 (AP 2) domain located within group I and II transcription factors of the AP 2 /ERF superfamily. Semiquantitative PCR experiments indicated that each CpRap 2 gene is differentially expressed under stress conditions, such as extreme temperatures. Moreover, genetic transformants of tobacco plants overexpressing CpRap 2. 4 a and CpRap 2. 4 b genes show {{a high level of}} tolerance to cold and heat stress compared to non-transformed plants. Confocal microscopy analysis of tobacco transgenic plants showed that CpRAP 2. 4 a and CpRAP 2. 4 b proteins were mainly localized to the nuclei of cells from the leaves and roots and also in the sieve elements. Moreover, the movement of CpRap 2. 4 a RNA in tobacco grafting was analyzed. Our results indicate that CpRap 2. 4 a and CpRap 2. 4 b RNA in the papaya tree have a functional role in the response to stress conditions such as exposure to extreme temperatures via direct <b>translation</b> <b>outside</b> the parental RNA cell...|$|R
40|$|Tonga, {{the only}} un-colonized Polynesian Kingdom, is facing {{uncertain}} times. The traditional power of local chiefs and {{their responsibility to}} the people has been progressively weakened by globalisation and the modern state. Christian churches have {{become the most important}} institutions, mediating between the constitutional monarchy and a desire for more participative democracy. Community fundraising events demonstrate people’s love and support for their churches. One man’s comedy has helped build 24 churches and buildings over 20 years. Tevita Koloamatangi, nicknamed Tinitini, was denied his birthright to be chief in his village of Pangaimotu on the island group of Vava’u. People here are famous for their emotional volatility, warm heartedness and generosity in the eyes of their cousins on the main island, Tongatapu. As a comedian, Tinitini has created a new influential role, using his participative comedy to address current social issues to audiences in Tonga, New Zealand, Australia and the United States. The documentary follows Tinitini on a journey around his island to meet other performers and discover the secret of their improvised parody and satire. Tinitini and his companions’ commentary and companionship offer an amusing and revelatory view of life in Vava’u. Their personal insights, motivation and courage over adversity are moving and inspiring. The comedians’ important role in Tongan society also suggests a democratic and egalitarian form of celebrity. The film contains five original comedy sketches or skits, which deal with important dilemmas modern Tongans are facing. These include Tonga’s changing relationship with the <b>outside</b> world, the <b>translation</b> of Christian teaching, love and jealousy, marriage and wealth, the fear of ghosts, and the state of the Monarchy. This film will stimulate discussion and debate on the cultural specificity of comedy, and its role in socio-political criticism and community building...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} {{in-depth}} interviews, narrative studies, discourse analysis and participant-observation, I {{will consider the}} strategic use of language in power relations within the community of Korean expatriate businesspeople and entrepreneurs in Southwest London. In particular, I {{will focus on the}} case of a single translator, “Mrs Park”, and how she has used her English language skills as a means not only of gaining power within both the Korean community, but to mediate between the Korean business community and non-Korean enterprises in London, and also to consolidate for herself a role as “gatekeeper ” between the two. I will also consider her role as “privileged insider ” within both Korean and non-Korean businesses, {{and the way in which}} she is able to build up a degree of power through using her position as the posssor of a rare linguistic skill. Moving out into the wider community, I will compare and contrast Mrs Park’s experiences with those of other Korean entrepreneurs <b>outside</b> of the <b>translation</b> industry, and how they employ both their English and Korean language skills to further their strategic positions: how command of English is used as a symbol of integration and/or globalisation in different situations, and how Korean is used as a symbol of shared experience, common culture and solidarity. I will also consider the wider role of language and translators, within the Korean business community in general, in terms of defining the community, and negotiating power relations with the outside world. Through the case of Mrs Park and the comparison of her experience with that of other Korean businesspeople in the UK, I will build up a picture of the role which language and translation play in power relations and the definition of identity in a community of transnational businesspeople.

40|$|H. pylori {{is missing}} the glutaminyl- and asparaginyl-tRNA synthetases (GlnRS and AsnRS, respectively). Consequently, H. pylori uses an {{indirect}} aminoacylation pathway to generate Gln-tRNAGln and Asn-tRNAAsn. Within this process, Asn-tRNAAsn {{is produced by}} misacylation of tRNAAsn with aspartate by a non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-AspRS). Next, the heterotrimeric, glutamine-dependent amidotransferase (called AdT or GatCAB) converts the misacylated Asp-tRNAAsn into Asn-tRNAAsn. A parallel pathway exists for the synthesis of Gln-tRNAGln, wherein misacylation of tRNAGln with glutamate is catalyzed by a tRNAGln-specific glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS 2) to generate Glu-tRNAGln; this misacylated intermediate is converted to Gln-tRNAGln by the same AdT. This dependence on misacylated intermediates for protein synthesis suggests a requirement for additional mechanisms to prevent the misincorporation of Glu and Asp into proteins in place of Gln and Asn. H. pylori elongation factor (EF-Tu) provides one such machinery, {{but it is not}} sufficient to maintain translational accuracy, suggesting the need for additional mechanisms. Hp 0495 and Hp 0100 were identified by yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H) as potential new players in tRNA aminoacylation and fidelity. By Y 2 H, Hp 0495 showed interactions with EF-Tu and Hp 0100 was connected to both ND-AspRS and AdT. The work presented in this dissertation examined the possible roles of both of these proteins in indirect aminoacylation and in promoting tRNA accuracy. Using SPR, native gels, and size exclusion chromatography, we have shown that Hp 0495 forms complexes with EF-Tu in both its GDP and GTP forms, but preferentially binds EF-Tu*GTP. In collaboration with a colleague, Dr. Keng-Ming Chang, we have discovered that Hp 0495 binds ATP, glutamate, and either tRNAGlu 1 or tRNAGln and forms tRNAGln-dependent complex with GluRS 2. Also, Hp 0495 binds deacylated tRNAs more tightly than aminoacylated tRNAs for the five cases tested in this work. Hp 0495 has similarities to ACT/RAM domains; these domains typically regulate different aspects of amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. Our hypothesis is that Hp 0495 might be a regulatory protein, sensing tRNAGlu 1 /tRNAGln and directing one or both it to either GluRS 1 /GluRS 2 for aminoacylation or for functions <b>outside</b> protein <b>translation.</b> The hp 0495 gene is in an operon with mraY and murD, these two enzymes are involved in cell wall biosynthesis, suggesting that Hp 0495 might be involved in regulating this process. There is also precedence for the involvement of EF-Tu in cell wall biosynthesis, supporting this hypothesis. In collaboration with a colleague, Dr. Gayathri Silva, we have demonstrated that Hp 0100 is, in fact, an essential component of a tRNA-independent Asn-transamidosome complex. This complex contains ND-AspRS, AdT, and Hp 0100 and facilitates AdT 2 ̆ 7 s transamidation process of Asp-tRNAAsn (35 -fold) and Glu-tRNAGln (3 -fold). Our work characterizing the Asn-transamidosome and transamidation of Asp-tRNAAsn was published in 2013 (Silva, G. N., Fatma, S., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 288, 3816). An hp 0100 knockout suggests that Hp 0100 is not essential under robust growth conditions. Our revised hypothesis is that the growth conditions used in these experiments were too permissive and did not adequately reflect the stress conditions faced by H. pylori in its human niche. Viability of our hp 0100 strain will be tested under different stress conditions with the goal of identifying conditions where Hp 0100 is conditionally essential. Finally, we have initiated the characterization of third protein of unknown function, Hp 1259. Preliminary data suggest that it might be involved in the indirect aminoacylation of tRNAGln. In the H. pylori genome, 499 open reading frames (ORFs) are annotated as hypothetical proteins whose functions are not known, including Hp 0100 and Hp 0495. We have assigned an important function to Hp 0100, namely promoting tRNA aminoacylation, and have identified a new functional characteristics for Hp 0495 that clearly demonstrate its role in tRNA aminoacylation and/or function. The existence of these proteins of unknown function and their interactions with components of the translation machinery clearly demonstrate that the classical boundaries of the field of tRNA aminoacylation need to be expanded...|$|R
