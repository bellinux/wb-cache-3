5|$|The {{holding up}} <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> with middle and index fingers crossed {{was the usual}} gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E

25|$|The current organ was {{originally}} installed in 1973, {{although it is}} still housed in the old late Victorian organ case. It was rebuilt in 20023, with additions and re-fittings. The current chapel is open to members of all denominations. The current chaplain is Reverend Dr Dominic Keech, who also serves in a pastoral capacity. The Chapel also houses a portrait and a painting <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> of the Childe of Hale, described in contemporary sources as man of 9 foot 3 inches in height.

40|$|Jewish laws {{prescribed}} {{that when}} a first-born son was presented in the temple shortly after birth, the offering consisted of two turtle doves or pigeons. And if the family were very poor, a handful of wheat would suffice: the wheat that would fit in the palm <b>of</b> <b>one’s</b> <b>hand.</b> That wonderful Jewish custom, which I learnt about when writing this text, moved me deeply on account of what it shares with my proposal of making models capable of fitting into the palm <b>of</b> <b>one’s</b> <b>hand...</b>|$|R

25|$|The corpse {{was badly}} decomposed, {{although}} the pathologist who examined Fleszar's remains {{was able to}} determine the young woman had been stabbed approximately 30 times {{in the chest and}} abdomen with a knife or other sharp object, that her feet had been severed just above the ankle, the thumb and sections of the fingers <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> were missing, and that one forearm had been severed from her body (these severed appendages were never found). Despite the advanced state of decomposition, the pathologist was also able to locate multiple lineal abrasions upon the victim's chest and torso, indicating that Fleszar had been extensively beaten before her death. Although police theorized that Fleszar had been raped, the advanced state of decomposition of the corpse had erased any conclusive evidence of sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Wait staff trays are {{typically}} large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food {{to people in}} restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. The waiter or waitress carries the tray with the open palm <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> placed underneath, in about {{the center of the}} tray, relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of the tray to retain control of the tray. Occasionally, the tray may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash to the floor. In a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury {{as a result of a}} toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray.|$|E
25|$|Vishnu {{iconography}} {{show him}} with a dark blue, blue-gray or black colored skin, and as a well dressed jeweled man. He is typically shown with four arms, but two armed representations are also found and discussed in Hindu texts on artworks. The historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell between first two fingers <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> (left back), a chakra – war discus – in another (right back). The conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence, while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil. One of his arms sometimes carries a gadda (club, mace) which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge. In some icons, he holds a lotus flower which symbolizes purity and transcendence. Vishnu iconography show him either in standing pose, seated in a yoga pose, or reclining. Hindu texts on iconography describe design rules of these.|$|E

50|$|One way to {{distinguish}} between them is by their cones. Each has barbs {{at the end of}} the scales. The sharp Jeffrey pine cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> when rubbed down the cone. Ponderosa pine cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands.</b> Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of Jeffrey pine are glaucous, less bright green than those of ponderosa pine, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs.|$|R

25|$|A second study, {{conducted}} by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect {{with respect to}} the somatosensory system. Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand.</b> The patients were tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs {{with respect to the}} sensory receptor surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the somatosensory system, stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate {{the nature and extent of}} neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s single-hose {{regulators}} {{started to take}} over as the standard, and this complicated the buddy breathing procedure. The single hose exhaust valve position {{at the bottom of}} most DVs made it necessary to offset the recipient to the right side when face to face, or to the left when side by side. The standard procedure of continuous exhalation during ascent to avoid lung over-pressure injury could leave the diver with insufficient air to clear the regulator, so it was necessary to hold the DV in a way that did not obstruct the recipient from accessing the purge button, as the single hose would not normally free flow when raised above the head. The increasing popularity of the buoyancy compensator was another complication, as it is necessary to periodically vent it during an ascent to avoid a runaway expansion of the contents and an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This requires the use <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand.</b> the other is needed to control the regulator and hold on to the other diver, a moderately complex set of simultaneous tasks. It is possible to coordinate these activities, but this requires greater skill than with the original procedure, and therefore more intensive training to perform reliably. Since running out of air was becoming less common, the procedure was practiced less often, and skills generally deteriorated. The use of a secondary (octopus) second stage or a bailout cylinder removes the necessity for this complex and relatively stressful procedure.|$|E
500|$|The 1988 Croydon {{study found}} {{a variety of}} {{gestures}} in common use. These were crossed fingers <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> (44%), crossed fingers of both hands (26%), thumbs through fingers (6%) (boys only) and arms crossed across the chest (2%). Other gestures, reported in ones and twos, included miming an injection into the arm, licking the thumb, making a T-shape with the hands, three fingers held up and the [...] "Vulcan" [...] sign from Star Trek. Virtually all schools reported the use of crossed fingers.|$|E
