5|$|The {{police found}} five {{passports}} on Martin {{in addition to}} his own—two British passports issued to Simon Davis, two Canadian passports issued to Sheila and Darin Damude, and a South African passport issued to Gerard Lowe—each with Martin's photograph affixed. They also found credit cards belonging to Sheila Damude and Gerard Lowe. In addition, police found Simon Davis' birth certificate, and items that Martin had used to immobilise and kill: a hammer weighing 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb), a battery-operated Z-Force III electroshock weapon, a can of mace, two pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbcuffs, two Police brand foldable knives, an <b>oilstone</b> and two Swiss army knives. Importation of some of these into Singapore is illegal.|$|E
50|$|Scary sharp is {{a method}} of {{sharpening}} woodworking tools with sandpaper instead of conventional methods of <b>oilstone</b> or waterstone sharpening. The sandpaper referred to here can be any abrasive impregnated sheet used in the various industries to smooth surfaces and examples include glass paper, silicon carbide, emery cloth, etc. The sandpaper is affixed to another hard, flat substrate to create the sharpening surface. Sheet-glass is commonly used, but a machinist's granite surfacing block, marble baking slabs, plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or even jointer out-feed tables will produce satisfactory results. The method of fixation is usually {{a matter of the}} user's preference, and can include plain water (by means of surface tension), sprayed-on adhesive, or by simply using adhesive-backed abrasive paper. This is exactly the same method as that used by materials scientists in preparing polished samples for metallography.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} styles of jig {{available}} commercially. Fundamentally, all jigs {{are similar in}} that they allow the user to clamp the blade or tool in some way. The jig then has some means of referencing the clamped blade to the grinding or honing apparatus so that the bevel angle is maintained. One of the more common approaches {{is to have the}} jig ride on a roller. These types of jigs are usually used with a sharpening stone or plate, such as a waterstone, <b>oilstone</b> or diamond abrasive surface. Other types of jigs are used to present the blade to the wheel of a grinder. There are generally two types of hand sharpening jigs, push jigs and side to side jigs. Push jigs run perpendicular to the length of the stone and a side to side jig runs with the blade parallel to the length of the stone.|$|E

Anglicizing the {{superalloy}} {{mechanical and}} cutting characteristics, {{and according to}} the oil-stone grinding characteristics, choose the current commonly abrasives in the domestic. Processing performance test of inconel 718 deep-hole honing is carried out. The comparison test results show that the grinding performance of ceramic corundum is better than other <b>oilstones</b> at test condition. Grinding characteristics of ceramic corundum is carried on, study show that the size of ceramic alumina grits range from 0. 067 to 0. 005 µm, The grinding passivated tiny grains of ceramic corundum oil-stone broken and fall off timely, which is beneficial to oil-stones, self-sharpness. The excellent performance of ceramic corundumcan self-sharpening can improves the efficiency of honing effectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Power {{ultrasonic}} honing is {{an advanced}} precision grinding technology, with ultrasonic vibration applied on the <b>oilstone</b> surface. The high frequency vibration of <b>oilstone</b> make cutting fluid appear cavitation effect, which make acoustic field of power ultrasonic honing present instability and complex, and even appear chatter and noise. In this paper, the cavitation mechanism of power ultrasonic honing is explained, and the <b>oilstone</b> radiated pressure are obtained. Furthermore, the dynamics and radiated pressure model of cavitation bubble in the grinding area is established and analysed. Finally, {{the pressure of}} <b>oilstone</b> surface is measured by ultrasonic sound intensity measuring instrument. It shows that the acoustic pressure radiated from <b>oilstone</b> with theoretical calculations and simulations are one order higher than cavitational threshold value of cutting fluid, ultrasonic cavitation occurs. Cavitation bubbles have been nonlinear vibration with high frequency, great amplitude and up to 10 7 Pa orders pressure, which seriously affect the workpiece processing quality and <b>oilstone</b> life. Comparisons between theoretical analysis and experimental verification have shown a satisfactory agreement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The main failure {{forms of}} <b>oilstone</b> forming die is serious wear {{on the work}} face, so the key point to extend the use life of die is how to control the wear. In order to improve the {{hardness}} and resistance to wear and prolong the use life of the <b>oilstone</b> forming die, the boronizing technology was used on the work face of the <b>oilstone</b> forming die. There are some of elements such as B、C、Al、 Cr、Si and Fe etc in boronizing layer, all of them change their contents during boronizing. Maximum value of microhardness of boronizing layer appears in subsurface, not in surface, and lows along depth of boronizing layer. The abrasion resistance of boronizing layer comes out maximum after quenching and tempering. After quenching and tempering, the lifetime of the <b>oilstone</b> forming die with boronizing is greatly improved...|$|E

50|$|Grinding is {{generally}} done with {{some type of}} sharpening stone. Sharpening stones come in coarse and fine grits and {{can be described as}} hard or soft based on whether the grit comes free of the stone with use. Many sources of naturally occurring stones exist around the world; some types known to the ancient world are no longer used, due to exhaustion of former resources or the ready availability of superior alternatives. Arkansas, USA is one source for honing stones, which are traditionally used with water or honing oil. India is another traditional source for stones. Ceramic hones are also common, especially for fine grit size. Japanese water stones (both artificial and natural) come in very fine grits. Before use, they are soaked in water, then flushed with water occasionally to expose new stone material to the knife blade. The mixture of water and abraded stone and knife material is known as slurry, which can assist with the polishing of the knife edge and help sharpen the blade. Generally, these are more costly than <b>oilstones.</b> Coated hones, which have an abrasive, sometimes diamonds, on a base of plastic or metal, are also available.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grinding chatter is a {{hazardous}} phenomenon that frequently occurred during grinding process. The topic takes radial ultrasonic vibration honing {{as an example}} to explore the dynamic changes of grinding force in ultrasonic honing process. By analyzing obtains the following conclusions: (1) The friction coefficient between work-piece and whetstone is a nonlinear time variable; (2) Adding radial ultrasonic is mainly to change the positive pressure between whetstone and work-piece, thereby affects the mutual friction between work-piece and <b>oilstone</b> in honing; (3) Whether ordinary honing or ultrasonic honing, friction dynamic changes along with time, performance of whetstone relative to work-piece is discontinuous sliding — jerking motion...|$|E
