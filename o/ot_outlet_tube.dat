40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} of heat exchange rate of {{several types of}} vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs) with different condition of inlet water temperatures, borehole depths, and tube configurations have been carried out.

Also, increasing the borehole depth lowers temperature difference between circulated water and surrounding ground and then lowers the heat exchange with the ground.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Cyclone emission tests were conducted on 1 D- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones with varied <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> sizes and inlet velocities. Talc and wheat dusts were used in testing the laboratory scale models. Data from these tests were used in developing a mathematical computer model capable of predicting outlet dust emissions given the following input variables: dust type and inlet concentration. inlet air velocity, and cyclone type. The model was developed based on the observation that a cyclone fractional efficiency curve (FEC) resembled a normal distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF). The cut-point and sharpness-of-cut of the FEC were correlated to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution's CDF, respectively. The model also estimated cyclone pressure drops based on given inlet velocities. Results showed that the correlation of parameters was indeed acceptable. Actual versus program generated emission concentrations were similar, with the estimated emissions being slightly higher. Actual test results showed 1 D- 3 D emission concentrations being less than 2 D- 2 D emissions under similar conditions. Reduced cyclone outlet sizes increased cyclone dust collection efficiencies, but with higher pressure drops. Lower than design inlet velocities reduced cyclone dust collection efficiencies. There was minimal collection efficiency difference between beaded cone and smooth cone cyclones. Tests with extended cyclone <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> versus design <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> also showed minimal collection efficiency differences...|$|R

30|$|The {{simulated}} temperature {{along the}} inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> {{is shown in}} Fig.  2 b. With an inlet temperature of 6  °C and a flow rate of 450  cm 3  s− 1, we calculated an outlet temperature of 8  °C, which matched the temperature of 8.1  °C measured at the outlet of the BHE in our field fairly well. Hence, {{we assume that the}} obtained temperature profiles of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> are realistic. In the first 10  m, the temperature gradient was lower than that in the other layers (thermal conductivity of layers two to six in W m− 1  K− 1 : 2.6, 2.83, 3.01, 2.87, and 2.92) due to the smaller thermal conductivity of 1.2  W m− 1  K− 1. At a depth of approximately 80 – 90  m, the EGRT (enhanced geothermal response test) provided unexpectedly high apparent thermal conductivities of 3.4  W m− 1  K− 1. As they exceed the values measured in samples from this depth range, we assume that groundwater flow has occurred in this region, which has contributed to the high apparent thermal conductivity by advective heat transport. Therefore, we used our first model to obtain the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> temperatures at this depth range. Their difference was approximately 0.3  K at 80 – 90  m depth and decreased with increasing depth. We used the 0.3  K difference in the second model by assuming inlet and outlet temperatures of 7.0 and 7.3  °C, respectively. For the temperature of the surrounding soil at approximately 85  m depth, we assumed 10  °C. The temperature distribution for the underground was determined by a numerical model. In this model, we used a typical heat production rate of 0.6  W m− 2 on the bottom and the paleontological heat increased over the last 60  years (Mann et al. 2008) as the top boundary conditions, respectively.|$|R

Electrode potential measurements were obtained in diluted semen and in various diluents by employing a platinum electrode enclosed within a slightly modified Michaelis vessel. This was closed by a glass stopper which contained an electrode, an inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes</b> for nitrogen gas, and a saturated agar KCl bridge connected with the calomel half cell. Number of spermatozoa was adjusted to make 5 × 10 ^ 8 per milliliter and five milliliters of test sample were used for studying the electrode potential measurements. After the introduction of test sample into the vessel, 0. 025 milliliters of 0. 5 mM methylene blue were added to the sample. Most of the air was then replaced with purified nitrogen gas, the vessel stoppered and calomel half cell were set up in an incubating bath kept at 35 ℃. All potential measurements were made on a Hitachi-Horiba, F- 5 pH meter. The electrode potential of diluted semen decreased rapidly during approximately first 30 minutes, accompanied by a slow down for additional 30 minutes, after which the potential showed a constant tendency for Eh in general. When the diluted semen was aerated for several seconds by means on babbling air through a <b>outlet</b> <b>tube</b> for nitrogen gas after the potential had reached steady level, it caused a sudden rise in electrode potential.

30|$|Under {{stationary}} conditions, {{the model}} with groundwater flow as advective heat transport is dominant (soil temperature is 10  °C) {{and is on}} average warmer than the one without flow. From the results in Fig.  4, groundwater flow appears to only minutely change the temperature at the inner ring sensors labeled 1 – 8 (see Figs.  1 and 3). However, the inner ring is essential for determining the sensor’s position relative to the BHE tubes. As the double U-tube heat exchanger is asymmetrical, the temperature shift resulting from the BHE layout {{has to be taken}} into account. Depending on the groundwater’s angle of incidence, the distorted temperature distribution differs with the relative position of the inlet <b>tubes</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes,</b> provided that they have a temperature difference.
