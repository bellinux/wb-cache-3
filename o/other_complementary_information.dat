In the present study, we evaluated the {{perceptions of}} birds held by farmers who engage in conventional and non-conventional agricultural production processes {{and the implications of}} potential differences in these perceptions on species conservation. To accomplish this, data were collected using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and <b>other</b> <b>complementary</b> sources of <b>information</b> gathered from 191 farmers in northeastern Brazil. Although some similarities were identified among the farmers in their perceptions and local ecological knowledge (LEK) of birds, differences existed between the conventional and non-conventional farmers in their attitudes toward, conflicts with, and usage of bird species. Compared to the conventional farmers, the non-conventional farmers could identify more bird species, possessed more favorable attitudes toward birds, and engaged in practices more beneficial to the conservation of avifauna. The perceptions that were identified were related to the type of agriculture practiced, and such perceptions may affect the conservation of bird species. Therefore, the adoption of certain agricultural practices has important implications for conservation. Our results indicate the need for investment in public policies, programs and actions that account for farmers' knowledge and perceptions. Such investments will contribute to the development and adoption of practices supporting wild bird conservation in agricultural areas...|$|R

In each case, the three subfamilies of adrenergic receptors (β, α 1, and α 2) are considered. Emphasis is placed on time sequence imaging in live cells, providing insights to receptor mobilization and regulation. The use of recombinant fusion proteins such as green fluorescent protein has been mainly confined to cell culture; fluorescent ligands can also be utilized in native tissues. It is shown how the two approaches can validate each <b>other</b> and provide <b>complementary</b> <b>information.</b> The importance of appropriate image acquisition and quantitative image analysis is stressed if meaningful data are to be acquired. These approaches have resulted in the recent discovery of more diverse adrenergic receptor locations in both unexpected tissue types and subcellular locations. Finally, the ability to exploit the changing fluorescent properties of interacting fluorophores to elucidate interactions between receptor molecules, such as dimerization or chaperoning, are considered. It is concluded that we have entered a new phase in which visualization of adrenergic receptors in multidimensional analysis is providing new insights to receptor biology, and that visualization in live heterogeneous organs and tissues is bringing this to the physiological level...|$|R

The insight of this paper comes from the following observation. Descriptors around keypoints encode the local information, and two keypoints are matched if the local information around them have the most common information/structure. However, multispectral images contain less common information than the-same-band (monomodal) images. Therefore, the local information around keypoints, i.e., descriptors, can not provide so many correct keypoint mappings, especially when the spectral difference is large. Intuitively, the local information on multispectral images becomes insufficient to decide whether a keypoint mapping is correct. Consequently, <b>other</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> to descriptors is necessitated for building reliable keypoint mappings.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we ask: what kind of {{information}} {{and how much of}} it should firms voluntarily disclose? Three types of disclosures are considered. One is information that complements the information available only to informed investors (to-be-processed <b>complementary</b> <b>information).</b> The second is information that is orthogonal to that which any investor can acquire and thus complements the information available to all investors (preprocessed <b>complementary</b> <b>information).</b> And the third is information that substitutes for the information of the informed investors in that it reveals to all what was previously known only by the informed (substitute information). Our main results are as follows. First, in equilibrium, all types of firms voluntarily disclose all three types of information. Second, in contrast to the existing literature, <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> disclosure by firms strengthens investors' private incentives to acquire information. Substitute information disclosure weakens private information acquisition incentives.

40|$|The use of long-wave {{infrared}} (LWIR) CO 2 lasers and microbolometer arrays {{in digital}} holographic and speckle interferometry shows interesting features for full-field displacement/deformation metrology and nondestructive testing. The {{first one is}} that the long wavelength yields the measurement of larger displacements together with decreasing the sensitivity to environmental perturbations. Therefore these interferometric methods can be applied more easily in industrial field applications. Another advantage was put forward in the European project FANTOM which is presented in this paper. In addition to specklegrams, the thermal background is captured simultaneously. Therefore in displacement metrology one can correlate uniquely the temperature and displacement information {{at the same time and}} in each pixel. We describe the successful achievements of the project. Thorough understanding of optics and speckle interferometry crossed with state-of-art in thermam imaging systems allowed to study this new hybrid technique in deep and tackle some specific constraints for reaching the best performances. As a result, a mobile instrument has been developed and validated on various industrial structural testing facilities and inspection areas. It has been used in thermomechanical measurements as well as in detection of defects in aeronautical composites. In particular we show that the two parts of the signal (the thermal part on one hand and the interferograms showing the deformation on the <b>other</b> hand) yield <b>complementary</b> <b>information.</b> A very interesting result is that it allows increasing the probability of detecting defects, for some of them are better seen in the thermal signal, whereas others appear only through local surface deformation...|$|R

The case study used for testing the proposed methodology is the huge Chartreuse of Pavia, with a special focus on a relatively unexplored portion of the monument. The survey, based on 3 D laser scanning and orthoimages, integrated by historical studies and <b>other</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> (thermoluminescence dating, IR imaging, hystorical analysis), allowed to read all the architectural aspects hidden in this highly architecturally stratified monument, improving in this way the comprehension of the building’s transformations in time.

On other hand the 3 D models were used to obtain a cross-validation of the historical evolution hypotheses developed by experts in the various disciplines involved in the project.

Yet, even the dimmest of views can be of great utility when combined with <b>other</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> about a material. The modification of vertical TGA systems provides a low-barrier of entry to gathering Curie temperature data, and when integrated with DSC {{it can be done}} at low marginal cost to collecting other data about material transformations. The Continuous Wavelet Transformation data analysis technique brings a great degree of automation and repeatability to magnetic balance based Curie temperature determination with analysis and post processing of the magnetic balance data reduced from many minutes of unreliable hand fitting to a few seconds of scripting. These gains in speed and reproducibility are particularly important as the rapidly growing field of materials modeling continues to yield ab initio magnetic material predictions that demand experimental verification. Promising multifunctional magnetic compounds predicted via computation and verified with these techniques can also be characterized for processing and service optimization as the shape and location of magnetic transitions contains information about the phase transformations within these materials. The Curie temperatures of select Heusler alloys were measured via this new technique with a maximum standard error of 2.5 % while showing good agreement with previously reported results for most compounds.|$|E

Nevertheless, the manner of information search and retrieval on Wikipedia remains that of conventional keyword-based search and retrieval of a list of articles instead of more focused results. It would be highly desirable to have tools that could maximize the effective and innovative use of a vast amount of information content in Wikipedia. The objective of the PanAnthropon project is to create a large-scale e-learning/e-knowledge portal for digital humanities based on the information extracted from Wikipedia (as well as <b>other</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> sources).

40|$|Short {{time scale}} (~days to year) soil {{incubation}} experiments have evidenced that mineralisation rate of soil organic carbon could be increased by higher fresh organic matter (FOM) inputs. This process could affect global soil C stocks but its importance {{has yet to}} be assessed at decennial or centennial time-scales. In this study, we analysed soil organic carbon (SOC) data from a 52 -years old bare-fallow experiment in Grignon (France) where plots received no organic matter, or only fresh straw or composted straw. Treatments receiving fresh or composted straw showed no significant difference in SOC stocks dynamics over the 52 years, suggesting no long-term impact of priming effect. To go further, we evaluated whether soil organic matter (SOM) mineralisation rates differed between plots with no input and plots with FOM inputs, using simple models of SOC dynamics based on the Hénin-Dupuis formalism. Using a model with three SOC pools, we showed that estimated mineralisation rates were 3 – 4 times slower for the plots with no input, suggesting an important role of priming effect. However, a 4 -pools model with first order kinetics could satisfactorily fit all the data using a same set of parameters. Our results did not assess the absence of priming effect on SOC stocks dynamics at decennial timescale, but suggest that priming effect is not necessarily a relevant process to explain long-term SOC dynamics. It would be worthwhile to test our modelling approach on other long-term datasets, in particular from more nitrogen-limited experiments and using <b>other</b> data giving <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> on mineralisation rates, such as 14 C.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{a paradigm}} {{for exploring the}} digital TV information domain, characterized by {{a large number of}} channels. The proposal is based on the introduction of ambiguous schemes for organizing information related to the TV domain; these schemes, already popular and successful for seeking information on the web, are here introduced for helping people who appreciate iterative and interactive search, involving mechanisms of associative learning. Serendipity is here used as an approach complementary to exact organization schemes and useful especially for zappers who browse the TV domain without knowing, in advance, what they are looking for. The TV domain is here presented as a fully navigable 3 D world populated by visual counterparts of TV channels, called time-pillars. These artifacts are composite objects that offer simplified access to TV information and a number of related functions. The paradigm introduced in this study supports users who prefer the explorative approach for navigating TV streams, and in particular the part of the TV domain that is not supported by any Electronic Program Guide (EPG) or <b>other</b> <b>complementary</b> <b>information</b> services. The 3 D metaphor can be used also as an interface for EPGs, in order to obtain a less fragmented view of the whole TV domain.
