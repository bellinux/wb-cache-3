5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Twin Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based <b>on</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E

The present study aims {{to find out the}} factors that affected the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cropping patterns in hills and plains of this region and develop statistical models to explain these changes. Primary data were collected from key persons residing in the villages of four districts (Kavrepalanchowk, Bhaktapur, Chitawan and Parsa) Region under multistage sampling technique. Causal factors such as plot size, distance from market centre, family size, profit and market opportunities had significant effects while other two factors, education and irrigation had insignificant effects <b>on</b> the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cropping patterns in the region.

5|$|With his students, Voight has {{analyzed}} pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced seismicity, volcanic debris avalanches, and {{volcanic eruption}} prediction. Voight has {{also served as}} a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, {{as well as in the}} United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based <b>on</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.|$|E

25|$|BOLD {{contrast}} {{depends on}} blood flow, {{which is both}} slowly changing and subject to noisy influences. Other biomarkers now looked at to provide better contrast include temperature, acidity/alkalinity (pH), calcium-sensitive agents, neuronal magnetic field, and the Lorentz effect. Temperature contrast depends <b>on</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> brain temperature from its activity. The initial burning of glucose raises the temperature, and the subsequent inflow of fresh, cold blood lowers it. These changes alter the magnetic properties of tissue. Since the internal contrast is too difficult to measure, external agents such thulium compounds are used to enhance the effect. Contrast based on pH depends <b>on</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the acid/alkaline balance of brain cells when they go active. This too often uses an external agent. Calcium-sensitive agents make MRI more sensitive to calcium concentrations, with calcium ions often being the messengers for cellular signalling pathways in active neurons. Neuronal magnetic field contrast measures the magnetic and electric changes from neuronal firing directly. Lorentz-effect imaging tries to measure the physical displacement of active neurons carrying an electric current within the strong static field.|$|E
