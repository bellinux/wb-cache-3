5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop off the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E

5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson taking the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> as Silva circled outside. Jackson opened the action with an {{overhand}} right, and immediately moved backwards. Both fighters appeared cautious {{for the opening}} minutes of the fight, exchanging strikes and quickly moving away. Silva focused on leg kicks, while Jackson focused on working the jab.|$|E
5|$|The first-ever Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cage</b> {{match for}} number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship was next. The {{participants}} in the encounter were Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Jackie Moore, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Salinas, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. In this match, the participants fought {{on the outside of}} the ring to climb into the cage. The first two to do so had a standard wrestling match, with the winner determined by pinfall or submission. It lasted 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Laveaux and Love were the first to enter the cage, with Laveaux gaining the pinfall after her signature Voodoo Drop maneuver to become the first-ever Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cage</b> and become number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who {{moved out of the}} way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> onto Raven in a seated position, forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 Lethal Lockdown {{match was}} the seventh bout on the card, between Team Cage (Christian Cage, Matt Morgan, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Sting) and Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). The {{duration}} of the contest was 26 minutes and 45 seconds. A Lethal Lockdown match is fought under no disqualification rules, in which weapons are legal and one wrestler from each team starts the match in the cage. Afterwards, members from each team enter at time intervals until all wrestlers {{are involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission can occur. Cage and Styles started the match. Brother Ray, Rhino, Storm, Nash, Brother Devon, Morgan, Tomko, and Sting were the order of entrances for the contest. Shortly after Sting's entrance, a roof covered in weapons was lowered onto the cage. With Sting's participation all men were involved in the match, as such a pinfall or submission could now occur. During the encounter, Cage set up a table on top of the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Later, he and Styles were fighting on top of a ladder on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> when Storm pushed over the ladder causing them both to crash through the table. Storm then climbed down from the roof into the cage, where Rhino tackled and pinned him to secure the victory for Team Cage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs off the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|While Silva had an {{impending}} fight with Franklin, {{he was still}} asked about his future with Jackson. Indeed, {{in an interview with}} Fighters Only Magazine, Silva reiterated his desire to fight Jackson for a fourth time, and added that he wants it to be the final fight of his career. He also said that he no longer has problems with Jackson outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
30|$|These results {{illustrate}} <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image morphing and warping method, which directly {{benefit from}} the segmentation result and obtain a smooth transition between the original images. In the first example (Fig.Â  7), <b>the</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> (Definition 9) that best corresponds to a similarity using a turning function is found. Recall that the turning function returns <b>the</b> correspondence <b>of</b> points between <b>the</b> two <b>cages</b> that has <b>the</b> minimum turning distance. The intermediate interpolated image can then be obtained using <b>the</b> correspondence <b>of</b> <b>cages.</b> <b>The</b> second example (Fig.Â  8) has been obtained by avoiding <b>the</b> step <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages.</b> <b>The</b> morphing results show smoothness since the segmentation also are similar. In the third example (Fig.Â  9), we have an example of two images previously segmented with the CAC (see result in Fig.Â  6). Here, the morphing between the two different objects is smooth and the intermediate images clearly show the transition between the successive pairs. In the Additional fileÂ  1 we include an additional file video with an animation of a morphing result. In this animation one can appreciate the smooth transition between images.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to experimentally induce inflammatory cysts in an animal model so as to test the hypothesis that radicular cysts develop via the "abscess pathway. " METHODOLOGY: Twenty-eight perforated custom-made Teflon cages were surgically implanted into defined locations in <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> 7 Sprague Dawley rats. A week after <b>the</b> implantation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cages,</b> a known quantity of freshly grown, close allogeneic oral keratinocytes in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was injected into each cage. One cage per animal was treated as the control that received only epithelial cells. <b>The</b> remaining 3 <b>cages</b> <b>of</b> each animal were trials. Seven days post epithelial cell inoculation; a suspension of 0. 2 mL of Fusobacterium nucleatum (10 (8) bacteria per mL) was injected into each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 trial <b>cages.</b> Two, 12, and 24 weeks after <b>the</b> inoculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bacteria, <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> were taken out, and the tissue contents were fixed and processed by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy. Sixteen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21 trial <b>cages</b> could be processed and yielded results. RESULTS: Inoculations of epithelial cells followed 1 week later by F. nucleatum into tissue <b>cages</b> resulted in <b>the</b> development inflammatory cysts in 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16 <b>cages.</b> <b>The</b> 2 <b>cages</b> contained a total of 4 cystic sites. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control <b>cages</b> showed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> any cyst-like pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory cysts were induced by initiating acute inflammatory foci (abscess/necrotic area) by bacterial injection that got enclosed by a proliferating epithelium. This finding provides strong experimental evidence in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> "abscess theory" <b>of</b> development of radicular cysts...|$|R

5|$|During the {{following}} match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although the contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled {{most of the}} early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including once when Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman was not looking. Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> {{all the way to}} the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, MÃ¡scara AÃ±o 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> to victory.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Edge against Batista in a Steel Cage {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, which could be won by pinfall, submission, or {{escaping}} the cage.

5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period where no one would be allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Ãšltimo Guerrero and Averno climbed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> This left El SatÃ¡nico to fight MÃ¡scara MÃ¡gica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit.
