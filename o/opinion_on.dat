40|$|Instead of {{studying}} {{the properties of}} social relationship from an objective view, in this paper, we focus on individuals' subjective and asymmetric <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> their interrelationships. Inspired by the theories from sociolinguistics, we investigate two individuals' <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> their interrelationship with their interactive language features. Eliminating the difference of personal language style, we clarify that the asymmetry of interactive language feature values can indicate individuals' asymmetric <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> their interrelationship. We also discuss how the degree of opinions' asymmetry {{is related to the}} individuals' personality traits. Furthermore, to measure the individuals' asymmetric <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> interrelationship concretely, we develop a novel model synthetizing interactive language and social network features. The experimental results with Enron email dataset provide multiple evidences of the asymmetric <b>opinions</b> <b>on</b> interrelationship, and also verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in measuring the degree of opinions' asymmetry...|$|R

5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal <b>opinion</b> <b>on</b> the border dispute.
