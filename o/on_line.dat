5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out-of-date rectifiers {{not being able to}} handle the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 1, on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. <b>On</b> <b>Line</b> 9, that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E
5|$|The first {{services}} started <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 1 on 18 January 1900, {{the other}} services starting on 10 May that year, but, facing {{competition from the}} CTR, the tramway from Petit-Quevilly was curtailed, its terminus becoming Rue Léon-Malétra.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{modernisation}} {{in recent}} years has centred around the Underground's rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular <b>on</b> <b>Lines</b> A and H. Along with this came the construction of new underground workshops and storage areas <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities <b>on</b> <b>Lines</b> B and D.|$|R
5|$|The park is {{accessible}} via the Märkisches Museum U-Bahn station <b>on</b> <b>line</b> U2 and bus number 147. It is also {{close to the}} promenade which has been created along {{the bank of the}} Spree south of the Jannowitzbrücke.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> A and two <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations {{in that part}} of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E
5|$|Electric Company. The group ran {{lines to}} bars and {{businesses}} on Washington Avenue and supplied {{them from the}} first hydroelectric central power plant in the U.S., thirteen years before the Niagara Falls plant went <b>on</b> <b>line</b> in 1894. In 1883 with Washburn, Martin, H. T. Welles, Thomas Lowry, George R. Newell, Anthony Kelly, Clinton Morrison, J. K. Sidle, W. W. Eastman, William D. Hale, Charles A. Pillsbury and Charles J. Martin, Loring incorporated the Minneapolis Sault Ste. Marie & Atlantic Railway Company known as the Soo Line Railroad.|$|E
50|$|Waiblingen {{station is}} served by S-Bahn trains <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> S2 and S3 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn and Regional-Express trains <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> R2 and R3. Long-distance {{services}} generally do not stop in Waiblingen.|$|R
5|$|Other works {{being carried}} out during this period include the {{improvement}} of disabled access in older stations, new ventilation systems <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> B, C and D, improvements in electrification (such as replacing overhead <b>lines</b> and substations) <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> A, B, C and D and the replacement of 14km of track <b>on</b> <b>Lines</b> C and E. The total investment in this period for these new projects has been set at US$1.34 billion.|$|R
50|$|In some implementations, {{a comment}} may begin {{anywhere}} <b>on</b> a <b>line,</b> including <b>on</b> the same <b>line</b> after properties or section declarations. In others, including the WinAPI function , comments must occur <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> by themselves.|$|R
5|$|In this period, {{there has}} also been {{widespread}} cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Line 5 {{operates}} the entire ring with a 15-minute headway. From east to west, trains <b>on</b> <b>line</b> 5 enter the common tunnel from the Grorud Line {{then make a}} full clockwise circle around the Ring Line, including a second pass of the common tunnel, before proceeding {{to the end of}} the Sognsvann Line.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article <b>on</b> <b>line</b> breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E

At the level above (-2), trains <b>on</b> the other <b>lines</b> head into the city, in the {{direction}} of Kröpcke.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{is served}} by two railway stations, <b>on</b> different <b>lines</b> of the Zurich S-Bahn. Schlieren railway station is in the geographic centre of the municipality and a stop <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> S3 and S12. Although Urdorf railway station {{takes its name from}} the adjoining municipality of Urdorf, it is actually located just within the boundaries of Schlieren, and is a stop <b>on</b> <b>lines</b> S9 and S15.|$|R

5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 1 of the T-bane, {{and replaced}} the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they could operate on the Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily. The T2000 were taken out of service in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{network has}} over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from {{historic}} murals to modern art. Styles also vary, from mosaic to fileteado, sculpture and installation pieces. Many stations {{are decorated with}} intricate ceramic tile work, some of which date back to 1913 when the Underground first opened its doors. Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Raúl Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> H.|$|E
5|$|Along Line 2, {{the station}} is located between the Jinke Road station and the Tangzhen station. It takes {{approximately}} 60 minutes to ride the train to the East Xujing station, {{the west end of}} the line, and 34 minutes to the Pudong Airport station, the eastern terminus. The train operates from 5:30 to 22:45 westbound and from 6:30 to 21:00 eastbound. On weekdays, trains leave the station approximately every 3 minutes and 30 seconds during peak hours and every four to ten minutes during non-peak hours. Peak hours are defined as from 7:30 to 9:30 and 17:00 to 19:00 on Monday through Thursday, as well as 7:00 to 9:00 and 12:50 to 20:30 on Friday. On weekends, trains leave the stations every 4 minutes and 5 seconds from 8:00 to 20:30, and every five to ten minutes during other times. The station is a transfer station for passengers traveling to or from points east <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 2. From Guanglan Road to the east, Line 2 uses 4-carriage trains; to the west Line 2 uses 8-carriage trains.|$|E

5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back <b>on</b> <b>line,</b> and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E
5|$|As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came <b>on</b> <b>line,</b> they flanked the 19th Indiana {{and drove}} the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest {{regiment}} in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By {{the end of the}} three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. William Dorsey Pender's division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the Lutheran Seminary and Gettysburg streets.|$|E
5|$|As on 31 March 2015, the Company has a {{total of}} 1306 coaches (220 trains). Apart from {{extensions}} on various existing lines, two new lines viz. Line 7 & 8 are proposed in Phase III. 486 coaches (81 six-car trains) being procured for these two new lines will have advance feature of Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Additional 258 Broad gauge (BG) coaches for Line 1 to 4 and 138 Standard Gauge (SG) coaches for Line 5 & 6 are proposed to be procured for augmentation/extensions to cater to the increased traffic. Resultantly, {{at the end of}} Phase III, there would be 2188 coaches (333 trains). Barring a few 4-car trains <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> 5, 93% of the trains would operate either in 6 car or 8 car configuration at the end of Phase III.|$|E

5|$|By December 1941, the M2A1, M2A2 and M2A3 {{were used}} for {{training}} only. The majority of M2A4s, which went to the US Army, were also used only for training between 1940 and 1942. The U.S. Marine Corps ordered M3 Stuart tanks to outfit its armored units in 1940, but as the new tank was not yet in production, it received 36 M2A4s, after which point production of the M3 had come <b>on</b> <b>line.</b> Many of these tanks were deployed during the Battle of Guadalcanal while assigned to A Company, 1st Tank Battalion, where they and M3 Stuarts were typically spread out among infantry units. Their use was generally limited to providing mobile fire support to the Marines, either in disabling Japanese bunkers or using canister shot against Japanese attacks. In defensive engagements, the M2A4s and Stuarts would deploy in pairs, so they could cover each other with machine gun fire against Japanese soldiers armed with satchel charges.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 70s, {{efforts were}} {{primarily}} concentrated <b>on</b> <b>Line</b> E, which was re-routed from its terminus at Constitución to {{the centre of}} the city at the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to boost passenger figures, something which proved to be successful. The segment was opened by president Arturo Illia in 1966 and Spain offered CAF-General Eléctrica Española trains in order to cancel part of the debt it had accrued with Argentina; trains which continue to serve on the line today. The line was extended westward to José María Moreno in 1973, in what would be the only expansion of the decade.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully <b>on</b> <b>line,</b> Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E
