40|$|This report {{concentrates}} on <b>other</b> <b>personal</b> <b>services</b> {{and activities of}} households as employer of domestic personnel. Part I analyses recent relevant sector developments and trends and depicts {{the current state of}} play in the sector, with an emphasis on innovation, skills and jobs. The findings of Part I of the report combine original data analysis using Eurostat structural business statistics and labour force survey data with results from an extensive literature review of relevant already existing studies. The findings of Part I are based on the present and the recent past. The second part of the report is future-oriented and looks at sectoral developments and more specifically developments in skills and jobs in and towards 2020. The core of part II consists of plausible future scenarios and their implications for jobs, skills and knowledge. These implications have been analysed for various job functions. In a final part III, a range of main strategic options (‘choices’) to meet the future skills and knowledge needs is reviewed, including implications for education and training. The study concludes with a number of recommendations for the sector (individual firms, sector organizations, sectoral partners), education and training institutes and intermediary organisations, and last but not least, policy-makers at various levels, ranging from the EU to the local level...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to Thrun and <b>others,</b> <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> robots need {{increasingly}} more autonomy {{in order to}} function in the highly unpredictable company of humans. At the same time, the cognitive processes in artifacts will become increasingly alien to us. This has several reasons: 1. Maturana’s concept of structural determinism questions conventional forms of interaction. 2. Considerably different ways of embodiment result in incompatible referential frameworks (worldviews). 3. Engineers focus on the output of artifacts, whereas autonomous cognitive systems seek to control their input state. As a result, instructional interaction – the basic ingredient of conventional man–machine relationships – with genuine autonomous systems will become impossible. Therefore the increase of autonomy will eventually lead to a paradox. Today {{we are still in}} a position to anthropomorphically trivialize the behavioral pattern of current robots (von Foerster). Eventually, however, when self-organizing systems will have reached the high levels of autonomy we wished for interacting with them may become impossible since their goals will be completely independent of ours...|$|R

50|$|A <b>personal</b> radio <b>service</b> is {{any system}} that allows {{individual}} to operate radio transmitters and receivers for personal purposes with minimal or no special license or individual authorization. <b>Personal</b> radio <b>services</b> exist {{around the world and}} typically use light-weight walkie talkie portable radios. The power output, antenna size, and technical characteristics of the equipment are set by regulations in each country. Many regions (for example, the European Union) have standardized <b>personal</b> radio <b>service</b> rules to allow travelers from one country to use their equipment in another country. Examples of standardized services include PMR446 and FM Citizens Band Radio (CB) in the EU and several other countries/regions. 26-27 MHz CB radio is the oldest <b>personal</b> radio <b>service</b> and is used in nearly every country worldwide, with many countries and regions copying the United States 40-channel frequency plan. In many countries, CB radio is less popular due to the availability of <b>other</b> <b>personal</b> radio <b>services</b> that offer shorter antennas, better protection from noise and interference.|$|R

5000|$|Citizens band radio (also {{known as}} CB radio) is, in many countries, {{a system of}} short-distance radio {{communications}} between individuals typically on a selection of 40 channels within the 27 MHz (11 m) band. Citizens band is distinct from <b>other</b> <b>personal</b> radio <b>service</b> allocations such as FRS, GMRS, MURS, UHF CB and the Amateur Radio Service ("ham" [...] radio). In many countries, CB operation {{does not require a}} license, and (unlike amateur radio) it may be used for business or personal communications. Like many other two-way radio services, citizens band channels are shared by many users. Only one station may transmit at a time; other stations must listen and wait for the shared channel to be available. It is customary for stations waiting to use a shared channel to broadcast the single word [...] "Break" [...] during a lull in the conversation. [...] This informs people using the channel that others are waiting.|$|R
