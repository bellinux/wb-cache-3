5|$|Although the NSR had joint {{ownership}} of the MB with the MS the NSR did not have running powers <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the MS and was content to let the MS handle all traffic north of Middlewood. Finally with both the NSR and the Great Western Railway (GWR) expanding into Shropshire running rights were agreed for NSR trains to run to Hodnet and Wellington and in return GWR goods trains could run to Stoke.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, Ptolemy {{retreated to}} Egypt, and Menelaus {{was forced to}} {{surrender}} Salamis and its garrison, further increasing Demetrius' strength. Demetrius then moved to take <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Cyprus, taking over the garrisons, some 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, into his own army as well. Menelaus and other relatives and friends of Ptolemy, however, who had been captured, were soon sent back to Egypt with their personal possessions.|$|E

5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} {{again just}} after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the group. He used the whole width {{of the road and}} coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the 20th century many {{recreation}} {{facilities were}} incorporated into the park. Parkland was levelled for football pitches in 1947. A second bowling green in the Recreation Grounds was laid out by the City Council in 1962 to join the green in the Museum Gardens laid in 1922. In 1972 the two fish ponds were reshaped and deepened to leave one pool (Beacon Pool) we see today. The golf course was laid out and opened in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The Hunger Games is a 2008 dystopian {{novel by}} the American writer Suzanne Collins. It {{is written in}} the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly {{advanced}} metropolis, exercises political control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> respiration rate (and other variables) was assessed in perfused rat skeletal muscle. The {{results indicate that}} the general pattern of control in resting muscle is similar to that seen in isolated rat liver cells (Brown et al. (1990) Biochem. J. 192, 355 – 362). Control over resting mitochondrial oxygen consumption was distributed between reactions involved in substrate oxidation (flux control coefficient = 0. 44 ± 0. 28) and those involved in ATP turnover (0. 21 ± 0. 09). The mitochondrial proton leak also had an important share of the control (0. 38 ± 0. 21). Since proton leak also has significant control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> respiration rate of isolated liver cells and liver and skeletal muscle account for around 60 % of the standard metabolic rate of a rat, then these results indicate the potential importance of proton leak as a mechanism of regulating metabolic rate...|$|R

Subsequently, a {{mountain}} is presented, following which the singer is portrayed with a husky dog {{in front of}} a snowy landscape, sporting a white hoodie. Following this, footage with two horses running free is shown, with her tossing her hair in a similar way to the animals' shakes. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the music video, Stan further performs to the song, while band Havana make a cameo appearance and are seen in several scenes interspersed through the clip.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E
5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of England {{south of the}} Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control {{the use of a}} river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E

5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1929 season, Pennock saw his {{pitching}} {{time and}} pitching quality diminish. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his career, he never posted more than 189 innings pitched {{in a season}} and his ERA rose to over 4.00. He suffered from bouts of neuritis in 1929 and 1930. Pennock won his 200th career game during the 1929 season, becoming the third left-handed pitcher to reach that mark. He led the AL in walks per nine innings pitched in 1930 (1.151) and 1931 (1.426). Pennock pitched four innings of relief against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series, recording two saves. The New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America named him their player of the year.|$|E
5|$|Johnny Cecotto Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the feature race by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, but lost the lead to teammate Evans heading into the first corner. Cecotto then understeered into the barrier while holding off Fabio Leimer and Jolyon Palmer spun in avoidance causing the turn to be blocked and the race was stopped because fifteen cars were stranded. Evans led the restarted race but lost the place to Bird after the pit stop phase. Bird opened up a healthy advantage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the field to win the race. Quaife-Hobbs started from pole position in the sprint race and kept the lead until Coletti passed him on the third lap. Although his lead diminished because of tyre wear Coletti led the remaining laps of the event to secure the victory.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a comfortable lead <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the field. When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreations premiere {{was seen}} in 6.77 million households. Media outlets {{described}} this as a solid result, comparable to the average Nielsen ratings for 30 Rock, another Thursday-night show on NBC. However, viewership declined almost every week <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the season, culminating in a season low of 4.25 million households for the final episode. The average first season viewership was 5.45 million households per episode. The Office experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. However, the low viewership presented a greater challenge for Parks and Recreation because NBC now trailed CBS, ABC and Fox in the ratings, and the move of comedian Jay Leno from The Tonight Show to a variety show in NBC's 10 p.m. weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule.|$|E

The black road before the buggy turned to a faint lavender, then was blotted to uncertain grayness.

5|$|The most {{successful}} {{example of the}} country’s economic evolution is the international financial services industry based in London. Within this sector aviation services are seen as critically important for both businesses and their clients, even {{in the era of}} video-conferencing. London’s air transport services are widely regarded within the London business community surveyed by the OEF to provide a competitive advantage <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Europe, and expansion of airport capacity in the South East has significant support. Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served.|$|E
5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti broke away from the pack and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described in this era, and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E
