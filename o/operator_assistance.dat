25|$|Direct {{distance}} dialing, {{which allowed}} callers to reach other users outside their local calling area without <b>operator</b> <b>assistance,</b> {{was introduced to}} the public in Englewood. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California. As of that date, customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial some exchanges in the New York City area, were able to dial 11 cities across the United States by dialing the three-digit area code preceding the local number.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{automatic}} exchanges, an <b>operator's</b> <b>assistance</b> was required for anything other than calling telephones across a shared party line. Callers spoke to an operator at a Central Office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. Being in complete control of the call, the operator {{was in a position}} to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or Dial systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1990s, {{as in most}} countries, to help law {{enforcement}} and the FBI more effectively carry out wiretap operations, especially {{in view of the}} emerging digital voice and wireless networks at the time, the U.S. Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994. This act provides the Federal statutory framework for network <b>operator</b> <b>assistance</b> to LEAs in providing evidence and tactical information.

Cognitive {{properties of}} supervisory control are summarized before describing their implications on the development of planning that is not an end in itself, but one of the possible means to keep the situation under control. Before reviewing the empirical results from the point of view of planning (abstraction and anticipation), the situations under study are briefly described from the planning point of view.

Mobile phones in most areas not yet served by HICOM require an <b>operator's</b> <b>assistance</b> for both local and long distance calls.
