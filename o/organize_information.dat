5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to <b>organize</b> <b>information.</b> However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
25|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} (and in {{particular}} the right hemisphere) is also involved {{in the formation of}} new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal recognition of an object they had seen in the past, but fail to recollect when or where it had been viewed. Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps <b>organize</b> <b>information</b> for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in executive function. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies semantic strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking about the meaning of the study material or rehearsing it in working memory.|$|E
2500|$|From 1917 forward, Hasse would {{struggle}} {{because of}} her German ancestry, support of the women's suffrage movement and equal pay and working conditions, desire to aggressively market library services, and lack of a husband. Anderson began keeping a file on Hasse, documenting every questionable move she made, even misconstruing legitimate inquiries to suit his needs. He reported her to the United States Secret Service in 1917 for [...] "suspicious activity," [...] which was largely {{due in part to}} her seeking other employment with President Wilson's Inquiry group. The Inquiry was formed by President Woodrow Wilson to [...] "collect and <b>organize</b> <b>information</b> for the eventual peace conference" [...] that would occur at the conclusion of World War I. Hasse inquired about work with the group only to find that Lydenberg and Anderson were already heading it up {{in the basement of the}} NYPL. Anderson claimed that since she had been born to German parents (her parents were Americans of German heritage) and was at a conference in Germany when the war began, she could not possibly have any other motive for working with The Inquiry other than that as a German spy.|$|E

Learning to <b>organize</b> digital <b>information.</b> Poster {{presented}} at 14 th Biennial Conference for Research on Learning and Instruction of EARLI, Exeter, England. In today's information society {{people have to}} manage an overload of information adequately. Being able to search, find, evaluate, select, process, <b>organize</b> and present <b>information</b> in order to acquire new knowledge is an important skill. This skill is defined as information-problem solving (IPS). However, research shows that many students {{are not able to}} solve information-based problems successfully, and that they have especially problems with the ability to <b>organize</b> found <b>information.</b> <b>Organizing</b> <b>information</b> in a proper way is not easy. Because people are used a hierarchical system, it seems natural to categorize information in classes and subclasses. Although hierarchical classification systems are a good way of bringing order in a collection of physical objects, with the use of virtual information objects it becomes possible to <b>organize</b> the <b>information</b> with labels or 'tags'. Consequently, information can be attributed to different classes. However, <b>organizing</b> <b>information</b> in a proper way is not a skill which is learned easily. Guidance and/or instruction is therefore needed. The poster presents a theoretical overview...|$|R
