5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the <b>overinflated</b> policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|The World Bank {{considered}} the cyclone {{as having a}} significant effect on Andhra Pradesh's economy. Andhra Pradesh's chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu estimated that the state would take as long as 30years to recover from the storm. The government provided RS$1,500 (US$420) to every family whose hut collapsed during the storm, and RS$100,000 (US$2,857) to the family of every person killed by the storm. However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment. The federal government provided about US$12million to the state, as well as tax deductions for monetary donations. Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined that the state government <b>overinflated</b> the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries. The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms. The storm also demonstrated the region's outdated infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to view it as a sign of weakness. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., <b>overinflated).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Barris built two {{fiberglass}} {{copies of}} the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit and a third for exhibition drag racing. Eventually, the three copies (and the screen-used metal Futura Batmobile) were covered with a black velvet [...] "fuzz" [...] paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies. [...] Later, all three were restored to their gloss black paint job. The three replicas are all based on a 1965–1966 Ford Galaxie. The #1 Barris-built Batmobile sold at Barrett-Jackson Auctions on January 19, 2013 for $4,620,000,. The three Barris copies all reside in private collections, including the exhibition drag racing version driven by wheelstanding driver Wild Bill Shrewsberry. This car was built with a dual-quad Holman Moody Ford 427 V8 engine, Art Carr-prepared Ford C6 automatic transmission and 5.14 gears in the rear end. Quarter-mile times were in the mid-12 second range, primarily because Shrewsberry would launch the car in second gear and smoke the <b>overinflated</b> rear tires for show down most of the strip. The [...] "rocket exhaust" [...] was made functional via a tank filled with either gasoline or kerosene which was pumped out the exhaust port and ignited electrically.|$|E

30|$|The Nihon Kohden linear inflationary {{non-invasive}} {{blood pressure}} (iNIBP®) measurement technology is an oscillometric device {{used to measure}} blood pressure by detecting oscillations during inflation. We can read systolic blood pressures without the need to <b>overinflate</b> the cuff higher than the true systolic pressure. Thus, the total time taken for inflation and deflation is shorter than that taken by conventional deflationary devices.|$|R
50|$|These {{suits are}} {{typically}} constructed of several layers and, being airtight, include a release valve so the suit does not <b>overinflate</b> from air exhaled by the SCBA. The release valve does retain some air {{to keep some}} positive pressure ("overpressure") inside the suit. As noted, such suits are usually limited to just 15-20 minutes of use by their mobile air supply.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: In supine {{patients}} with ARDS, the lung usually partitions into dorsal atelectasis and ventral aeration. Conventional positive-pressure ventilation directs tidal volume (VT) preferentially to ventral aerated areas. Attempts to 'recruit' atelectasis with positive pressure often <b>overinflate</b> aerated regions. This occurs {{due to a}} large vertical gradient of pleural pressure (Ppl) in ARDS. Prone positioning is the only effective means to lessen this Ppl gradient.|$|R

50|$|Tires: Problems with a vehicle's tires {{may result}} in the {{unexpected}} loss of control of a vehicle, due to such problems as reduced traction or a sudden loss of tire pressure during operation of the vehicle. Defects in the design or manufacture of a tire {{may result in}} tire tread separation of sidewall failure, even during normal use. Incorrect maintenance information provided by a manufacturer may cause a vehicle owner to <b>overinflate</b> or underinflate tires, reducing safety.|$|R
30|$|The Nihon Kohden linear inflationary {{non-invasive}} {{blood pressure}} (iNIBP) monitoring technology is an oscillometric device that measures blood pressure by detecting oscillations during inflation. Systolic blood pressure can be recorded without <b>overinflating</b> the cuff {{higher than the}} true systolic pressure. Thus, total time taken for inflation and deflation is shorter than that by the conventional deflation devices. In this study, the ability of iNIBP to detect maternal hypotension during cesarean section faster than deflationary non-invasive blood pressure (dNIBP) monitoring devices under clinical settings was evaluated prospectively.|$|R
50|$|Electrically-operated pumps {{intended}} to inflate car tires (as available in most service stations) can in principle {{be used to}} inflate a bicycle tire if the right type of connection is available. Some such pumps are designed to cut off before a suitable pressure (much higher for a bicycle than a car tire), and will much underinflate the tire. Others may not cut off, but deliver {{a high rate of}} flow to fill the larger car tire, with a risk of <b>overinflating</b> and bursting a bicycle tire unless it is stopped with split-second timing.|$|R

50|$|The size of each bubble {{depended}} {{on the amount of}} plastic used. Roughly the consistency of bubblegum, the bubbles formed were much more durable than simple soap bubbles, and could be gently manipulated to make different shapes, and stacked to make simple figures such as snowmen. However, they were not as durable as regular balloons, and could pop easily if <b>overinflated,</b> handled with too much force, or squeezed.|$|E
50|$|One major {{causative factor}} is the over {{stretching}} of the airways and alveoli (volutrauma). During mechanical ventilation, the flow of gas into the lung will take {{the path of least}} resistance. Areas of the lung that are collapsed (atelectasis) or filled with secretions will be underinflated, while those areas that are relatively normal will be <b>overinflated.</b> These areas will become over distended and injured. This may be reduced by using smaller tidal volumes.|$|E
25|$|Membership {{data on a}} {{relatively}} new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the Bahá'í population is spread out {{and not in a}} majority anywhere. Populations are not assigned a Bahá'í religious adherence by birth, {{as is the case with}} other major religions such as Islam and Christianity. Few religious surveys include the Bahá'í Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Bahá'í Faith are known to underestimate or <b>overinflate</b> many proportionally small groups. Additionally, Bahá'í membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.|$|R
40|$|Follow {{a decade}} of cinema {{relatively}} silent on virginity loss, films from the 2000 s onward both reflect and help constitute American culture’s anxious preoccupation with subject. In Abstinence Cinema, Casey Ryan Kelly examines the rhetorical and political weight of films about virginity from the Twilight film series to The 40 -Year-Old Virgin. This book connects the emergence of more conservative and fearful representations of sexuality {{with the success of}} the contemporary abstinence-until-marriage movement. Kelly shows how many contemporary films <b>overinflate</b> the personal and social value of remaining chaste, imploring audiences to think more carefully about the potentially dangerous repercussions of sexual activity. This book shows how pro-abstinence discourse in film and society stifle national conversations about sexuality and cultivate nostalgia for a world before feminism and sexual liberation...|$|R
5000|$|Gerald Nately {{is a young}} {{writer who}} writes a short story about his friend's wife, Mrs. Leighton (no first names for the couple are given). Mrs. Leighton is an {{enormously}} obese woman, so Gerald calls his short story [...] "The Hog." [...] Mrs. Leighton finds the story and mocks it, saying that she was too big for him to write about her, so he shoves the nozzle of an air compressor into her mouth and <b>overinflates</b> her, causing her to explode. Her remains are buried under the tool shed, and Gerald flees to the Near East after retitling his story [...] "the Blue Air Compressor." [...] Gerald's crime is never discovered, and eventually he cuts off his own head with a guillotine (after writing several dark and misunderstood novels, essays, short stories and poems).|$|R

The Gemini 9 astronauts wore suits inflated to 14 pounds per square inch, that being normal pressure on earth. NASA cut the level to 4 PSI, reducing the feeling of working inside an <b>overinflated</b> balloon. Furthermore, a new training was developed for moving about in space: practice sessions underwater since moving in a liquid resembles the effects of weightlessness.|$|E

500|$|People with [...] {{signs of}} {{inadequate}} respiration or oxygenation {{may need to}} be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Mechanical ventilation aims to reduce pulmonary edema and increase oxygenation. Ventilation can reopen collapsed alveoli, but it is harmful for them to be repeatedly opened, and positive pressure ventilation can also damage the lung by <b>overinflating</b> it. [...] Intubation is normally reserved for when respiratory problems occur, but most significant contusions do require intubation, and it may be done early in anticipation of this need. People with pulmonary contusion who are especially likely to need ventilation include those with prior severe lung disease or kidney problems; the elderly; those with a lowered level of consciousness; those with low blood oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels; and those who will undergo operations with anesthesia. [...] Larger contusions have been correlated with a need for ventilation for longer periods of time.|$|R
30|$|The {{choice of}} {{anaesthetic}} technique for laparoscopic surgery is predominantly general anaesthesia. However, {{penetration of the}} stomach may occur when the stomach is distended during the induction of anaesthesia. Some reports have implicated {{the use of a}} laryngeal mask as a cause for gastric distension, particularly if it is unknowingly malpositioned, and therefore an independent risk factor for gastric injury [7]. A laryngeal mask was used in our patient, and we believe that this may have been responsible for the hyperinflation of the stomach causing it to descend to a level below the umbilicus and {{in the path of the}} Veress needle and trocar. Care needs to be taken to avoid <b>overinflating</b> the stomach during ventilation. Where this is suspected to have occurred, due to upper abdominal distension or increased tympanism, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to evacuate the stomach prior to the creation of pneumoperitoneum in order to prevent injuries to the anterior surface of the stomach [4]. Should a complication occur, early recognition is essential.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{lines that}} where constructed, such as Lines 1, 2, and 8, used high {{capacity}} 6 car A-type trains in anticipation to heavy ridership. This choice later proved invaluable in the densely populated Guangzhou {{with all three}} aforementioned lines today having a peak ridership of over 1 million passengers each. However, {{in the early days}} of operation, ridership of these lines was low. Ridership for line 1 plateaued at - in the late 1990s and early 2000s even though it was projected to reach [...] in 1998. The under utilization of these lines at the time allowed experts to insist in lower capacity trains on newer lines and even led to the Guangzhou government being criticized for <b>overinflating</b> ridership predictions to approve metro projects. Preference was given small-capacity trains and low-headway operation in the planning of Lines 3, 5 and 6. Line 3 was to be built using smaller, lower capacity B-type rolling stock and Lines 5 and 6 was planned to use even lower capacity light metro four car L-type trains.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the more}} recent {{developments}} in studio craft {{seems to be the}} emergence of a solidified do-it-yourself (DIY) movement. Since the mid-century turn towards the conceptualization of the craft object significant academic and institutional structures have emerged to support studio craft.

500|$|Analysis of the MIS {{failures}} of Great Southern Group and Timbercorp focused on several factors. First, critics argued that some MIS investments resembled Ponzi schemes, where securing financial returns for existing investors relied on attracting new investors {{rather than on}} successful economic activity. Second, Great Southern Group's rapid expansion had been underpinned by high levels of debt, and in difficult economic circumstances in which new investment was diminishing and new borrowings were hard to obtain, that debt could not successfully be serviced. Third, some experts and Great Southern Group itself expressed concern that investor uncertainty caused by ATO rulings, and fueled by reporting of taxation policy issues, had scared investors away from their MIS. This was a view that the Australian Taxation Office rejected, arguing that the administrators of both Timbercorp and Great Southern had not identified taxation uncertainty as an issue. Finally, a range of commentators considered that the MIS tax concessions were encouraging unsustainable business models, with companies focusing on selling the tax benefits of investments rather than focussing on profitable commodity production. This, it was argued, led them to underestimate business risks, <b>overinflate</b> land prices, and sell products at lower-than-optimal prices. The failure of MIS schemes for these reasons was predicted in 2008 by Ajani, who argued that [...] "we know that investment driven by the demand for tax minimisation, and not market realities, is associated with collapse".|$|R
5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from <b>overinflating</b> by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|R
