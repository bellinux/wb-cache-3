The city's industrial base, established during the Soviet period, largely collapsed after the break-up of the Soviet Union and has recently only started to revive.

Daily flights from Osh Airport link Osh - and hence the southern part of Kyrgyzstan - to Bishkek and some international destinations, mainly in Russia.

The recent upgrading of the long and arduous road through the mountains to Bishkek has greatly improved communications.|$|E

To explore this idea, the paper uses a method called Flexible Least Squares.

Hence, some key provisions of the 1997 version that bring the IPPC in line with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) of World Trade Organization (WTO) are lacking. Overall, the Law is not an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> in plants and plant products in itself, but the lack of details in such important matters as pest risk analysis (PRA) suggest that barriers could arise in the interpretation of the Law or in its application through (secondary) normative acts...|$|E

The South African government has recognised the importance of developing national manufacturing capacity as a means of increasing employment and reducing poverty. To this end, the government provides substantial support to both the manufacturing and exporting sectors. The government also negotiated the Southern African Development Community (SADC) agreement which leverages competitive advantages for South African manufacturers exporting into the region. However, since the ratification of the SADC agreement in 2008, there has been no perceptible increase in export activity to the region when compared to other markets. This research study was conducted to determine why this is the case and what factors are influencing the process. A structured literature review was undertaken to encapsulate export barriers, the role of the South African government in the export process, and the SADC agreement.

40|$|Concerns about {{foodborne}} salmonellosis {{have led}} many countries to introduce microbiological criteria for certain food products. If such criteria are not well-grounded in science, {{they could be}} an unjustified <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade.</b> Raw poultry products {{are an important part}} of the global food market. Import and export ambiguities and regulatory confusion resulting from different Salmonella requirements were the impetus for convening an international group of scientific experts from 16 countries to discuss the scientific and technical issues that affect the setting of a microbiological criterion for Salmonella contamination of raw chicken. A particular concern for the group was the use of criteria implying a zero tolerance for Salmonella and suggesting complete absence of the pathogen. The notion can be interpreted differently by various stakeholders and was considered inappropriate because there is neither an effective means of eliminating Salmonella from raw poultry nor any practical method for verifying its absence. Therefore, it may be more useful at present to set food safety metrics that involve reductions in hazard levels. Such terms as "zero tolerance" or "absence of a microbe" in relation to raw poultry should be avoided unless defined and explained by international agreement. Risk assessment provides a more meaningful approach than a zero tolerance philosophy, and new metrics, such as performance objectives that are linked to human health outcomes, should be utilized throughout the food chain to help define risk and identify ways to reduce adverse effects on public healt...|$|E

In addition, the book describes the procedures and practices of dispute resolution. The international focus {{of the book is}} largely on the GATT, with the bulk of the book devoted to a discussion of a number of important substantive topics pertaining to the GATT. As the book points out, while a primary purpose of that international agreement was to lower tariffs, which has largely been achieved, high tariffs are not the only <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> between nations. 5 The GATT also imposes a number of other obligations, the more important of which are discussed in the book, including the most favored nation principle, the obligation of nondiscriminatory or national treatment for imports, the permitting of actions against unfair trading (primarily dumping and subsidies), and the regulation of non-tariff barriers to trade. Also discussed are a number of policies that compete 2 ̆ 2 with those of comparative advantage and liberal trade, 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 including concerns with national security, protection of health and welfare, and protection of the environment.

On some areas, harmonisation ought to be chosen above the principle of mutual recognition, but in other cases an increased administrative collaboration, mandatory training for the national authorities or information campaigns intended mainly for undertakings could be the answer. The possibility to help undertakings to sue member states for damages should also be investigated.
