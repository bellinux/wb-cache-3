5|$|After the Democratic Party's {{takeover}} of Congress, Bush allegedly delegated {{the responsibility for}} finding a new strategy almost solely to National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and deputy National Security Adviser Meghan L. O’Sullivan. Against {{the advice of the}} vast majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> and other administration officials, Bush finally decided on the 'surge' strategy devised by retired General Jack Keane and General David H. Petraeus. The book describes deep in fighting within the administration.|$|E
5|$|Brunner {{returned}} {{to the mouth of}} the Buller River in March 1861 but this time aboard a ship. Working in much greater comfort than on his last visit to the area in 1848, with other members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> he surveyed and laid out sections for what would become the town of Westport. Later that month he did the same for Greymouth. The work was soon completed and the party {{returned to}} Nelson in April 1861.|$|E
5|$|His unmailed {{letter was}} found by one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> and {{circulated}} among workers at the Anemia Commission. When Rhoads learned of this, he quickly made a public apology {{at a meeting of}} all staff and doctors. A while later, he was dismayed to hear that the letter was going to be discussed {{at a meeting of the}} Puerto Rico Medical Association. With relations having deteriorated locally, he returned to New York in December 1931.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} next show, against the advice <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seltzer {{defended the}} Cleveland Press {{and his own}} {{personal}} involvement in the case in his 1956 memoir The Years Were Good. Seltzer argued that he was convinced the Sheppard family {{was involved in a}} conspiracy to get away with murder and that he personally wrote the editorials, instead of passing them off to one of his employees, out of concern for the safety <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining {{in that position}} until 1981. During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently made fun of his conservative approach to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.|$|E
50|$|The Sufyani is a {{man whose}} trial {{involves}} his person, his power, his speed and <b>his</b> fighting. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wonders consists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staffs,</b> which kill anyone he strikes with them. The hadith about the Sufyani confirms {{that he is a}} tyrant who will spread corruption and crime in the Earth immediately before the appearance of the Mahdi.|$|R

50|$|Sennett {{terminated}} most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff's</b> {{contracts in}} 1928, {{and closed the}} studio to retool for the new talking pictures. Turpin was signed by the low-budget Weiss Brothers-Artclass company, perhaps the most ambitious coup that Artclass ever attempted. Turpin made two-reel comedies there for one year. Artclass usually traded on his peculiar vision with titles like Idle Eyes and The Eyes Have It.|$|R
5|$|Although Marshall had {{recommended}} that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch officers to senior positions as possible, most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> {{was made up}} of US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, which he did not wish to exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{and some}} members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM {{headquarters}} arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte {{soon after they}} were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and {{it was decided to}} abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed to move his headquarters.|$|E
50|$|McCarthy kept four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessor's <b>staff</b> {{members on}} <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> {{when he took}} over as {{majority}} leader, including deputy chief of staff Neil Bradley, who now has served in that role for three majority leaders.|$|R

5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was made}} {{commander}} of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while {{it was on the}} front line. His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, just two weeks after taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. The barrage, using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff.</b> Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Étaples. After recovering his sight, which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E

50|$|Like Mr Carter, Mr Wheeler's {{first name}} is never revealed. Mr Wheeler is {{headmaster}} of the school, {{where he is}} equally despised by staff and pupils. Mr Wheeler is a pedantic jobsworth, with little idea {{what is really going}} on amongst staff and pupils. Mr Wheeler is a conservative character who has a defined idea how people should live, and shows no restraint in questioning the morality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff's</b> private lives.|$|R

5|$|In July 2011, Rowling parted {{company with}} her agent, Christopher Little, {{moving to a}} new agency founded by one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff,</b> Neil Blair. On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, {{announced}} on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{announced}} the composition <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff,</b> known as General Headquarters (GHQ) on 19 April. Major General Richard K.

5|$|On 23 October, Maruyama's forces {{struggled}} {{through the jungle}} to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi, on his own initiative, began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel Toshinari Shoji, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that {{the left and right}} wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.|$|E

5|$|Penney {{and some}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> {{returned}} by air on 9 October. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire on 23 October 1952 {{for his role}} in Operation Hurricane. Torlesse was supposed to accompany him, but in view of the degree of radioactive contamination, he felt he could not leave his command. He sent Captain D. P. Willan, the skipper of Narvik in his stead. The Royal Navy ships departed the Monte Bello Islands on 31 October. Most of the scientific staff were dropped off at Fremantle, and returned to Britain on RAF Transport Command aircraft. The rest returned on Campania, which arrived in the United Kingdom on 15 December. Hawkesbury continued to patrol the area until 15 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and caving in dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among the officers were transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E
5|$|Since Mayor Senkichi Awaya {{had been}} killed while eating breakfast with his son and granddaughter at the mayoral residence, Field Marshal Hata, who was only {{slightly}} wounded, took over {{the administration of the}} city, and coordinated relief efforts. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> {{had been killed}} or fatally wounded, including a Korean prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Wu, who was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army. Hata's senior surviving staff officer was the wounded Colonel Kumao Imoto, who acted as his chief of staff. Soldiers from the undamaged Hiroshima Ujina Harbor used suicide boats, intended to repel the American invasion, to collect the wounded and take them down the rivers to the military hospital at Ujina. Trucks and trains brought in relief supplies and evacuated survivors from the city.|$|E
