5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found {{no statistically significant difference}} in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind.</b> He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, the eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have {{only one or two}} seconds, depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project was funded by the National Federation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind.</b>|$|E

Military saints were depicted on the south wall, while the north wall mostly features monks. All of the preserved frescoes were done in the 14th century and are an example of Palaiologan art. All captions to the frescoes are in Medieval Greek.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Blaine {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was only eighteen years old and younger than many of his students, Blaine adapted well to his new profession. Blaine grew to enjoy life in his adopted state and became an admirer of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. He also made the acquaintance of Harriet Stanwood, a teacher at the nearby Millersburg Female College and native of Maine. On June 30, 1850, the two were married. Blaine once again considered taking up the study of law, but instead took his new bride to visit his family in Pennsylvania. They next lived with Harriet Blaine’s family in Augusta, Maine for several months, where their first child, Stanwood Blaine, was born in 1851. The young family soon moved again, this time to Philadelphia where Blaine took a job at the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind</b> (now Overbrook School for the Blind) in 1852, teaching science and literature.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{was first}} {{performed}} on 13 June 1997 at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall during the 50th Aldeburgh Festival. Sally Burgess {{was accompanied by}} the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by Nicholas Kok. The companion piece was the chamber opera The Country <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind</b> which Turnage had composed relatively quickly {{in order to make}} up a full programme after Twice had turned out much shorter than originally intended. To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with a staging at its main home in the London Coliseum. This production was premiered on 20 October 1997 with Susan Bickley as the soloist and with Kok again conducting. In this context it was a companion piece for From the House of the Dead, an opera set in a Siberian prison camp.|$|E

5|$|Unsuccessful wars {{with the}} Republic of Venice, the Byzantine Empire and other {{neighboring}} states characterized {{the reign of}} Coloman's son, Stephen II, who succeeded his father in 1116. The earliest mention of the Székelys is {{in connection with the}} young king's first war against the Duchy of Bohemia. The Hungarian-speaking Székelys lived in scattered communities along the borders, but their groups were moved to the easternmost regions of Transylvania in the 12th century. StephenII died childless in 1131. During the reign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> Béla II, the kingdom was administered by his wife, Helena of Rascia, who ordered the massacre of the lords who had opposed her husband's rule. Boris Kalamanos, an alleged son of King Coloman, who attempted to seize the throne from BélaII, received no internal support.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blind,</b> the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E
5|$|Harihara's nephew and protégé, the {{dramatic}} poet Raghavanka of Hampi, whose style {{is compared to}} that of 10th-century poet Ranna, was the first to establish the shatpadi metre in Kannada literature in the epic Harishchandra Kavya (1200). According to L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is believed that in no other language has the story of King Harishchandra been interpreted in this way. The writing is an original in tradition and inspiration that fully develops the potential of the shatpadi metre. The narration has many noteworthy elegiac verses such as the mourning of Chandramati over the death of her young son Lohitashva from snake bite. The very writing that made Raghavanka famous was rejected by his guru, Harihara. His other well-known writings, adhering to strict Shaiva principles and written to appease his guru, are the Siddharama charitra (or Siddharama Purana), a larger than life stylistic eulogy of the compassionate 12th-century Veerashaiva saint, Siddharama of Sonnalige; the Somanatha charitra, a propagandist work that describes the life of saint Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar), his humiliation by a Jain girl and his revenge; the Viresvara charita, a dramatic story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> wrath of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the Hariharamahatva, an account of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and Sarabha charitra. The last two classics are considered lost.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} solving <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> wasted energy within {{buildings}} and homes, because currently the lights turned on inside building do not utilize natural, ambient {{light from the}} sun. Rather than having unnecessary light from a light source, the automated light sensing smart <b>blinds</b> can sense <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> light outside <b>the</b> window and in the room, and then adjust <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blinds</b> to save energy by utilizing the available outdoor light. This way, the light source will not be running at maximum power output while there is excess light coming through the window. This project aims to design and construct <b>the</b> light sensing <b>blinds</b> to achieve <b>the</b> aforementioned goals. Hardware test results from this project demonstrate <b>the</b> capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smart <b>blind</b> system to measure ambient light inside the room and outside the window, to adjust <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blinds</b> on <b>the</b> window, and to change <b>the</b> desired brightness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room...|$|R
