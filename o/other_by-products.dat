Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half.

2500|$|Starting in the 1819, {{there was}} heavy {{traffic on the}} Singapore River due to rapid {{urbanization}} and expanding trade. At the same time, it brought in water pollution caused by the disposal of garbage, sewage and <b>other</b> <b>by-products</b> of industries located along the river's banks. The sources of water pollution into the Singapore River and Kallang Basin included pig wastes from pig and duck farms, unsewered premises, street hawkers and vegetable wholesaling. Riverine activities such as transport, boat building and repairs were also found along the Singapore River. Some 750 lighters [...] along the Singapore River and Kallang Basin in 1977. Waste, oil spills and wastewater from these boats and lighters added to the pollution of the rivers. In 1977, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew called for a clean up of Singapore's rivers, which included Singapore River and Kallang River. The clean up costed the government $300 million. The clean up involved a massive relocation of about 4,000 squatters, along with hawkers and vegetable sellers, whose daily waste flowed into the river. Public housing was found for the squatters, while street hawkers were persuaded to move to hawker centres. The government then dredged foul-smelling mud from the banks and {{the bottom of the}} river, and debris and other rubbish cleared.|$|E
