40|$|Abstract — Energy {{is one of}} the {{important}} crucial input factor in the thermal industries require new combustion concepts for effective utilization of the fuel with controlled emissions. Due to the depletion of fossil fuels at alarming rate and increasing of pollution levels from the various combustion processes such as I. C. Engines, boilers and furnaces, the need arises for the evolution of the new combustion techniques in contrast with the existing combustion techniques. The increased consumption rate and crude oil price leads to the usage of alternate fuels or newer technological development. Furnaces operating below optimum efficiency and emission levels can be improved by new technological approaches by retrofitting in new systems. Oscillating combustion is relatively a simple process. It is accomplished by introducing an oscillating valve on the path of the fuel line. The oscillations are introduced by the valve which operates at different amplitudes and oscillating frequency. The effect of these oscillations is increased heat transfer to the load which results in low fuel consumption, increased production rate and boosts furnace efficiency. Oscillating combustion methodology for overall improvement performance of an aluminium foundry furnace was taken up. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of an <b>oil</b> <b>fired</b> <b>furnace</b> which is a metric for total productive maintenance initiative has been calculated. The results of these experiments led to significant savings in fuel consumption, enormous reduction in NOx emissions and highly cost effective which results in revenue savings...|$|R

As an extension of the success experienced with the furnace program, a new program has been developed simulating a crude oil distillation unit. The Distillation Column Operator training program is designed to facilitate an understanding of distillation principles and the effect on energy efficiency for the various product quality and yields achieved.
