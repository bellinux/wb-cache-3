As evident from the graphs in Fig. 1, the rate of denaturation is dependent on temperature and humidity. The com-bined effect of 35 °C and high humidity for 3 days caused a 70 % decrease in all enzyme activities. In all situations, BIO {{appears to be the}} least denatured of the 3 enzymes. Exposure of actual samples in transit to high heat and humidity continuously for 3 days is unlikely, but in most areas of the United States, samples awaiting pickup from an <b>outside</b> <b>mail</b> deposit box could well be exposed to high heat and humidity conditions for several hours on a July afternoon, and perhaps for 2 afternoons over a weekend. Obviously, different climates will produce varying but predictable effects because of local seasonal weather vari-ations. Awareness that all of the enzymes are denatured to some extent led us to establish cutoffs for each enzyme below which heat denaturation might be a factor: For BIO, we used the cutoff of 28 ERU; for UT, 125 mol/L, and for G 6 PD, 100 mol/L. Thus, if a sample has a BIO value of 13 ERU (reference interval, 28 – 90 ERU), a UT value of 104 mol/L (reference interval, 155 – 389 mol/L), and...|$|E

Some, accustomed to the appearance of metropolitan villas, will think of brick buildings, with infinite appurtenances of black nicked chimney-pots, and plastered fronts, agreeably varied with graceful cracks, and undulatory shades of pink, brown, and green, communicated to the cement by smoky showers. Others will imagine large, square, many-windowed masses of white, set with careful choice of situation exactly where they will spoil the landscape to such a conspicuous degree, as to compel the gentlemen traveling on the <b>outside</b> of the <b>mail</b> to inquire of the guard, with great eagerness, [...] "whose place that is;" [...] and to enable the guard to reply with great distinctness, that it belongs to Squire ----, to the infinite gratification of Squire ----, and the still more infinite edification of the gentlemen on the <b>outside</b> of the <b>mail.</b> Others will remember masses of very red brick, quoined with stone; with columnar porticoes, about one-third of the height of the building, and two niches, with remarkable looking heads and bag-wigs in them, on each side; and two teapots, with a pocket-handkerchief hanging over each (described to the astonished spectator as [...] "Grecian urns") located upon the roof, just under the chimneys. Others will go back to the range of Elizabethan gables; but none will have any idea of a fixed character, stamped on a class of national edifices. This is very melancholy, and very discouraging; the more so, as it is not without cause.|$|R

[...] Although the foreign letter-carriers had been abolished by 1835, with their duties {{carried out by the}} other two services, the (by then renamed) General Post and London District letter-carriers remained separate until 1855, with separate chief inspectors.

Senior BNP figures nevertheless believed that these tabloids' hostile coverage of immigration and Islam helped to legitimise and normalise the party and its views among much of the British public, a view echoed by some academic observers.

The building {{also served as a}} residence, and it had the first telephone between Bowman and Branchville. The postal system of those early years in Bowman's history involved horse and buggy deliveries about twice a week from Orangeburg, and patrons from both town and surrounding areas had to pick up their mail from the post office until rural routes and carriers were organized to deliver <b>mail</b> <b>outside</b> the town limits in the early 1900s. Three rural routes were operational by 1907. The earliest carriers of record were W. H. Dukes, W. L. Bishop, O. P. Evans and Andrew Stroman, Sr. A fourth route was later added to serve the surrounding area, since reduced to three, and finally to the current two routes.|$|R

Vagulagiri hill is situated at the northeastern side of Ka of Karungulam village The people of this village are staunch devotees of Lord Venkatachalapathy, the main deity on the hill temple. This Lord has come from Thiruppathy. The enshrined god in this temple {{is in the form of}} two sticks (THARKALS) Which are used to drive the car in the temple car festival. These sticks are made up of sandalwood and placed close to each other and consecrated in the Sanctum Sanctorum The devotees of this Lord are working in various fields and get employed not only in India but world over. All are well off. They think that they have attained their present status by the Anugragam or grace of Lord Venkatachalapathy. Many devotees come to Karungulam for the Chithira festival of this temple and offer their prayers to lord Venkatachalapathy and take part in the activities of the 10th day Chithirai festival Except a very few festivals the other festivals are financed by the devotees. The residents of this village contact the other <b>outside</b> devotees by <b>mails,</b> letters festival invitations to inform them what is happening at the temples of this village every now and then. Apart from the chithirai festival, Puratasi Sani Garuda Sevai is celebrated in all the Saturdays of Puratasi month. Pavithrothsavam Festival is celebrated for three days in the month of July. A com mittee called Pavithrothsava Committee conducts this festival every year. Vishnu Sahasranama Laksharchana is celebrated every year and concludes with a grand Pushpanchali on the day of Masi Magam. Marthanthandeswarar Temple at the foot of the hill is also a famous temple and it can be seen in separate headings; Festivals of Vagulagiri and Foot hill temple.|$|R
5000|$|The {{priest who}} has {{charge of the}} spiritual {{interests}} of the Ruthenian settlers, commonly called Galicians, Rev. Nestor Dmytrow, has returned from {{a visit to the}} settlers in Alberta. They are located fifty miles northeast of Edmonton in the vicinity of Limestone and Beaver lakes, Edna being their post office centre. They number 120 families. Rev. Mr. Dmytrow states that some of them have been working in that district four years, others three years, and some two years, besides the twenty-five families who arrived last spring. Those who have been the longest in the country he finds to be very well off, having as many as twenty-five head of cattle, forty acres under cultivation, good farm buildings and everything in splendid order. One man is erecting a large storage house worth $2000. The settlers who are now in the second year of their residence, now being some twenty families, who came out through the efforts of Prof. Oleskow, have this year reaped their first crop; they are also doing very well. Rev. Mr. Dmytrow does not, however, report so favorably of the condition of those who came last spring from Bukowina. They were not provided with means; and he hopes that the government will come to their assistance to enable them to get through their first winter in the country; indeed he says it is absolutely necessary that this should be done. They number over twenty-five families. The people are seriously hampered by their distance from market and lack means of communication with the <b>outside</b> world. The <b>mail</b> is carried to Edna only once in two weeks; and the rev. gentleman urges very strongly that at least a weekly service be granted. He thinks {{it would be a great}} advantage to the settlers if - he could, as was done in the case of Dauphin, induce one of their fellow countrymen able to speak English, to come from Pennsylvania and open a grocery store in the colony. But for the drawbacks indicated he thinks that the colony in question would be the best of all the Ruthenian colonies; taking things as they are, however, he earnestly advises that no more destitute families be sent to that part. The remoteness of the locality and the lack of means of communication render it impossible for poor people to find employment by which they can earn a little money. A priest is expected to come from Galicia this coming winter to take charge of the Alberta colony under the Roman Catholic bishop of St. Albert.|$|R
