5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda.</b> Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda,</b> stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but that the man was not active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official.|$|E
5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> can {{be traced}} to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden {{traveled}} to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen to resist the Soviets. Under the guidance of Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden became more radical. In 1996, bin Laden issued his first fatwā, calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 {{condemned}} the attacks, and expressed readiness {{to take all}} necessary steps to respond and combat all forms of terrorism {{in accordance with their}} Charter. Numerous countries introduced anti-terrorism legislation and froze bank accounts they suspected <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> ties. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies in a number of countries arrested alleged terrorists.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda,</b> beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation are worse than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise <b>of</b> <b>Al-Qaeda.</b>|$|E
50|$|Samir Hijazi, {{known as}} Abu Humam al-Shami, was the {{military}} chief <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda's</b> Syrian affiliate al-Nusra Front.|$|R

40|$|This working {{document}} offers {{an analysis of}} the sources of financing <b>of</b> the <b>Al-Qaeda</b> network including some of its affiliated groups. The development <b>of</b> <b>Al-Qaeda's</b> financing has been similar to the evolution of its operational structure. The organization is currently under significant financial pressure. However, the number and magnitude of terrorist attacks attributed to Al-Qaeda in a number of countries implies that the network continues to have access to substantial financial resources to support its activities. The international community has so far not succeeded in cutting off many <b>of</b> <b>Al-Qaeda's</b> sources <b>of</b> financing; the organisation continues to access funding from wealthy benefactors, legitimate business and criminal activities...|$|R
5|$|By midday, the U.S. National Security Agency and German {{intelligence}} agencies had intercepted communications pointing to Osama bin Laden. Two {{of the hijackers}} were known to have travelled with a bin Laden associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan. He and others {{were part of a}} terrorist cell in Hamburg. One {{of the members of the}} Hamburg cell was discovered to have been in communication with Khalid Sheik Mohammed who was identified as a member <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda,</b> is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{hijacking}} of Flight93 {{was led by}} Ziad Jarrah, {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda.</b> Jarrah was born in Lebanon to a wealthy family and had a secular upbringing. He intended to become a pilot and moved to Germany in 1996, enrolling at the University of Greifswald to study German. A year later, he moved to Hamburg and began studying aeronautical engineering at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. While living in Hamburg, Jarrah became a devout Muslim and associated with the radical Hamburg cell.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of people attempted to flee Afghanistan following the attacks, fearing a response by the United States. Pakistan, already home to many Afghan refugees from previous conflicts, closed its border with Afghanistan on September 17, 2001. Approximately one month after the attacks, the United States led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the Taliban regime from Afghanistan for their harboring <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda.</b> Though Pakistani authorities were initially reluctant to align themselves with the United States against the Taliban, they permitted the coalition access to their military bases, and arrested and handed over to the U.S. over 600 suspected al-Qaeda members.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that it}} was sending a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron to participate in the campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan designated Operation Slipper. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals. The SASR's main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> and Taliban positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations. After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with US Marines from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around Kandahar and into the Helmand Valley near the Iranian-border. On 16 February 2002 Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a land mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident. Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> {{as part of}} the September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E

Distant targets include Israel, Europe (and the United Kingdom), Australia, and the United States.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>al-Qaeda's</b> connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings in 2005, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said: [...] "Al-Qaeda is not an organization.
