5|$|After the Japanese {{captured}} the Malayan Peninsula, both ships moved to Singapore harbour. On 8 February, the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting, many ships began evacuating from the harbour. By 11 February Gnat and Grasshopper were the largest vessels left. The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21:00 on 13 February, having taken <b>on</b> <b>other</b> personnel to evacuate them. Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes, {{formerly of the}} battleship , which had been sunk by the Japanese just over two months earlier. By the following morning {{they could hear the}} attacks by Japanese aircraft <b>on</b> <b>other</b> vessels in the distance. As they were sailing south, they were attacked by Japanese bombers. During the initial pass, Grasshopper was hit by a single bomb. When the planes returned, Dragonfly was hit three times and sank quickly. Grasshopper was hit twice and was set on fire. The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store.|$|E

5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, <b>on</b> <b>other</b> spiders, and <b>on</b> <b>other</b> arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety {{line to the}} surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

40|$|This {{current study}} {{examines}} {{a comparison between}} African-American men (N 25) and women (N= 25) who were diagnosed with a mental disorder and assessed their level of dependency <b>on</b> <b>others.</b> This study suggests that some people with specific mental health disorders have strong emotional and psychosocial attachment to dependency which limits their ability to think and do for themselves. Level of dependency includes emotional reliance <b>on</b> <b>others,</b> low self-confidence, and lack of autonomy. Findings revealed that men were more dependent <b>on</b> <b>others</b> than women. Also, those diagnosed with Schizophrenia were more dependent <b>on</b> <b>others</b> than those diagnosed with Anxiety, Bipolar or Depression. As {{the findings of this}} study revealed that men with mental disorders were more dependent <b>on</b> <b>others</b> than women, as practitioners it might be beneficial to find gender specific activities, resources and services tailored to men that will help enhance them to become more independent. For the findings by mental disorder, practitioners should create and implement disorder specific interventions that include activities, resources, and services that will improve the day to day social functioning and activeness of clients...|$|R
