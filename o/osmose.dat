6000|$|For instance, “while soluble crystalloids {{are always}} highly sapid, soluble colloids are {{singularly}} insipid,” {{as might be}} expected; for, as the sentient extremities of the nerves of the palate “are probably protected by a colloidal membrane,” impermeable to other colloids, a colloid, when tasted, probably never reaches those nerves. Again, “it has been observed that vegetable gum is not digested in the stomach; the coats of that organ dialyse the soluble food, absorbing crystalloids, and rejecting all colloids.” One of the mysterious processes accompanying digestion, the secretion of free muriatic acid by the coats of the stomach, obtains a probable hypothetical explanation through the same law. Finally, much light is thrown upon the observed phenomena of <b>osmose</b> (the passage of fluids outward and inward through animal membranes) {{by the fact that}} the membranes are colloidal. In consequence, the water and saline solutions contained in the animal body pass easily and rapidly through the membranes, while the substances directly applicable to nutrition, which are mostly colloidal, are detained by them.(154) ...|$|E
40|$|Osmotic {{dehydration}} can partially {{reduce the}} moisture content of most fruits and vegetables. This method {{was applied to}} New Zealand chestnuts and Philippine cassava. The effect of osmotic dehydration on mass transfer kinetics (water loss, solids gain and normalized moisture content) and quality of <b>osmosed</b> products were investigated. Shelled (i. e. shell removed) and unshelled (i. e. shell intact) chestnuts in bulk conditions (1 kg samples) were immersed in sodium chloride, sucrose, glucose and calcium chloride solutions of 15, 22; 50, 60; 56. 5 and 50 % (w/w), respectively for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 up to 24 hours. Cassava slices with 15 mm thickness in bulk condition (1 kg samples) were immersed in sodium chloride and sucrose solutions of 22 and 25; 60 % (w/w), respectively for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210 minutes. The solution to product ratio was kept above 10 to minimise the concentration change of the osmotic solutions during the dehydration experiments. Experiments were conducted at ambient conditions. For chestnuts, using glucose (56. 5 % w/w) and calcium chloride (50 % w/w) solutions produced unfavourable results. The normalised moisture content for both shelled and unshelled chestnuts using 22 % (w/w) sodium chloride and 60 % (w/w) sucrose solutions was reduced to about 75 and 80 %, respectively after 8 hours at 20. 5 °C. Thus, the chestnut shell {{was not a significant}} barrier during osmotic dehydration with these solutions. Water loss rates were higher compared to solids’ gain values both for shelled and unshelled chestnuts. The optimum osmotic dehydration time for shelled and unshelled chestnuts was 6 - 8 hours. Furthermore, using sodium chloride (22 % w/w), the recovery of wholenuts after mechanical shelling (i. e. shell removal) showed a statistically significant improvement from 28. 5 ± 0. 04 % (unosmosed) to around 45. 3 ± 0. 04 % (<b>osmosed).</b> In addition, with a different batch of chestnuts, using sucrose (60 % w/w) solution, an improvement of almost 16. 5 ±. 08 % (<b>osmosed)</b> from the control (unosmosed) on wholenuts shelling recovery achieved. Chestnuts <b>osmosed</b> with 22 % (w/w) sodium chloride were darker compared to the control samples while chestnuts <b>osmosed</b> with 60 % (w/w) sucrose was no colour difference to unosmosed chestnuts. However, chestnuts <b>osmosed</b> with sucrose were more brittle than unosmosed chestnuts. For chipped cassava the optimum osmotic dehydration time was found to be 210 minutes for 25 % (w/w) sodium chloride and 180 minutes for 60 % (w/w) sucrose. The sodium chloride (25 % w/w) solution achieved a slightly higher moisture loss compared to that of sucrose (60 % w/w) solution at 24. 5 °C. After osmotic dehydration, air drying was done for final drying (to a moisture content of 0. 13, wet basis) of the chipped cassava. The optimum drying temperature was 70 °C at 1. 8 m/s air velocity. Drying rate was not affected significantly by osmotic solutions and <b>osmosed</b> cassava was not affected by a 10 °C increase in the drying temperature. <b>Osmosed</b> products with 25 % (w/w) sodium chloride or 60 % (w/w) sucrose showed no gelatinization after air drying to 70 °C. Cassava <b>osmosed</b> with 60 % (w/w) sucrose was darker compared to samples <b>osmosed</b> with 25 % (w/w) sodium chloride and to unosmosed, air dried chipped cassava. If a chestnut processor’s aim is to get higher wholenuts recovery after mechanical shelling, a 6 hour osmotic dehydration period using 22 % (w/w) NaCl is recommended. Otherwise, if the processor prefers good shelling recovery and considers the broken nuts to be used for second stage by-products processing (e. g. crumb, chestnut flour), 8 -hour osmotic dehydration time before mechanical shelling is more advantageous. Osmotic dehydration for chipped cassava using 25 % (w/w) sodium chloride and 60 % (w/w) sucrose is only effective up to 210 and 180 minutes, respectively. The optimum air drying temperature for <b>osmosed</b> cassava chips with no gelatinization effect was 70 °...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the influence of osmotic solutions and their concentration on mass transfer and observe any effect on lycopene content, color and melting temperature (T m) of tomatoes. The tomato pieces were <b>osmosed</b> in maltose (35, 50 %), sucrose (35, 60 %) and sorbitol (35, 60 %), solutions for 2 and 6 h. Sucrose and sorbitol were highly effective in reducing water content in tomatoes, compared to maltose. Highest solid gain was found by using sorbitol. The 60 % of sucrose and sorbitol caused the reduction of lycopene content and alternation of color. The evaluation of T m was depended on osmotic agents and could be related with the solid mass fraction. The 50 % was recommended for the frozen tomatoes, compared to sucrose and sorbitol...|$|R
40|$|Plums (Najbolia and Stanley) {{and apples}} (Idared) were {{subjected}} to osmotic dehydration in 50 % solutions of fructose, sucrose and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) at 22, 40 and 60 °C for 24 hours. The content of fructooligosaccharides, sucrose and monosaccharides in dried material was determined. Plums <b>osmosed</b> in fructose contained from 22. 3 % w/w to 29. 6 %w/w of this saccharide depending on the process temperature. The content of sucrose in plums and apples varied from 18. 6 % w/w to 30. 4 % w/w after using sucrose as osmotic agent. Material processed at 40 °C was characterised by the highest content of FOS: 22. 6 24. 7 % w/w in plums (nystose as osmotic agent) and 13. 7 % w/w in apples (FOS preparation as osmotic agent).

5000|$|Davies {{created an}} {{immersive}} virtual environment in <b>Osmose</b> (1995), integrating 3D visual elements and spatially localized sound with interaction based on breath and balance. It was first exhibited in Montreal in 1995 at the Sixth International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA). <b>Osmose</b> challenged an immersant's (Davies' preferred term for viewer) notions {{of space and}} explored the [...] "porous borders between lived experience and virtual experience." [...] <b>Osmose</b> had a Cartesian 3D grid that the immersant {{would be able to}} travel through and [...] "visit" [...] twelve different world-spaces based on [...] "metaphorical aspects of nature." [...] An immersant entered the world of <b>Osmose</b> by wearing a Division head-mounted display and breath was measured though Polhemus motion sensors. The world is generated by an SGI Supercomputer. Breathing itself became the [...] "motor" [...] for the immersant to move through the virtual environment. Breathing out causes the immersant to feel as if they are sinking and breathing in causes them to have the sensation of floating up. Leaning one way or another gently causes the immersant to change direction. This biofeedback method of navigating <b>Osmose</b> was developed because Davies wanted to [...] "reaffirm the priority of 'being in the world' compared with 'doing' things in it or to it." [...] Davies spent many years researching light and space before creating <b>Osmose.</b> Davies had some help to realize her vision for <b>Osmose,</b> John Harrison to create the VR subsystem and Georges Mauro to create the models and textures for the virtual objects. Mauro worked from references provided by Davies' art. Overall, Davies emphasized that the [...] "creative process was exploitative, improvisational, and intuitive." ...|$|E
