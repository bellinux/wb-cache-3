5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with <b>oak</b> <b>chips</b> or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E

Both fungi selectively degraded lignin in wood chips. After 4 weeks of treatment, no significant changes in chemical composition were detected. In contrast to L. edodes, C. subvermispora produced alkylitaconic acids during fungal treatment, which paralleled the degradation and modification of lignin indicating the importance of these compounds in delignification. Light microscopy visualized a dense structure of wood chips which was difficult to penetrate by the fungi, explaining the relative lower lignin degradation compared to wheat straw measured by chemical analysis.

25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sorption of selected volatile substances from oak wood-chip samples (Quercus pyrenaica Willd. and Quercus petraea L.) subjected to different toasting levels, namely, without toasting, with medium toasting, and with strong toasting, through the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The main volatile compounds identified as a function of the toasting level and botanical species were furfural, hexanal, α-pinene, d-limonene, decanal, vitispirane, ethyl hexanoate, cis- 3 -methyl-γ-octalactone (“oak lactone” or “whisky lactone”), α-terpineol, p-xylene, and nonanal. Considering the data obtained from the toasted woods (medium and strong intensity) in comparison with those of nontoasted woods, it can be pointed out that the average peak area and the number of compounds identified in the gas chromatogram decreased during the toasting process. In general, regarding the compounds analyzed, quantitative differences were found between the two oak wood species under study. High values of volatile compounds were found in Quercus pyrenaica <b>oak</b> wood <b>chips.</b> In addition, for the number of compounds identified in oak wood extracts and directly extracted from solid <b>oak</b> wood <b>chips</b> by SPME, it is concluded that the best extraction process for volatile compounds from oak wood is the use of oak wood-chip liquid extracts.|$|R

2500|$|Like many grape varieties, Chardonnay {{first came}} to Australia in the {{collection}} of James Busby in 1832, but it only really took off in the 1950s. It is most significant in South Australia, New South Wales — especially the Hunter Region - and Victoria. One of the first commercially successful Chardonnays was produced by Murray Tyrrell in the Hunter Valley in 1971. Tyrell's vineyard was planted with Chardonnay cuttings that he [...] "borrowed" [...] from Penfolds' experimental plantings by hopping over their barb-wire fence one night and pruning their vines. The export driven Australian wine industry was well situated for the Chardonnay boom of the 1980s and 1990s and Australia responded with a unique style of wine that was characterized by big fruit flavors and easy approachability. To compensate for the very warm climate, richness was enhanced by the use of <b>oak</b> <b>chips</b> and acid was added during fermentation. During this period the number of Chardonnay plants increased fivefold and by 1990 it was the most widely planted white wine grape in Australia and third most planted overall behind Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early in the 21st century, demand outpaced supply and there was a shortage of Chardonnay grapes which prompted Australian winemakers to introduce new blending partners like Sémillon (known as [...] "SemChard") and Colombard.|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{algorithm}} (GA) combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression was applied {{in order to}} reduce the considerable number of variables of electrochemical signals recorded by a voltammetric electronic tongue. The algorithm was specifically designed for improving the analysis of data matrices with high collinearity, providing good solutions in terms of both predictive ability and interpretability and, at the same time, minimising the risk of overfitting. The variable reduction was carried out within a wine characterisation performed with an electronic tongue based on voltammetric sensors. In more detail, the aim was the evaluation of differences among wines aged by means of two different processes: the traditional ageing process in oak wood barrels and an alternative method based on the use of stainless steel tanks and <b>oak</b> wood <b>chips</b> or staves. The results show that the variables selected are at least as good as the full signals to separate the two different classes, even though the number of parameters has been reduced from 1980 to 280 variables; furthermore, the models obtained are simpler and more easily interpretable.

RESULTS: The HPS (high levels of polysaccharides) yeast strain released higher amounts of polysaccharides (429 g L− 1) than EC 1118 (390 g L− 1) during alcoholic fermentation, but the concentration equalized during the aging period (424 and 417 g L− 1 respectively). All aging techniques increased the polysaccharide concentration, but the increase was dependent on the technique applied. A higher liberation of polysaccharides reduced the concentration {{of most of the}} phenolic families analyzed. Moreover, no clear effect of the different aging techniques used in this study on color stabilization was found. The HPS wines were better valued than the EC 1118 wines by the panel of tasters after alcoholic fermentation. CONCLUSION: In general, the HPS wines showed better physicochemical and sensorial characteristics than the EC 1118 wines. According to the results obtained during the aging period, all aging techniques contributed to improve wine quality, but it was difficult to establish the technique that allowed the best wine to be obtained, because it depended on the aging technique used and the period of aging.

40|$|Background and Aims : During ageing in oak barrels, wine {{undergoes}} changes {{because of}} the release of polyphenols and other molecules from wood. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of some oak wood-derived volatile compounds, ellagic acid and oak wood extracts on the levels of (+) -catechin, procyanidin B 1 and malvidin- 3 -glucoside. Methods and Results : Phenolics and the oak wood derived volatile compounds studied were quantified by HPLC and by GC, respectively. Additionally, the new compounds formed in the solutions were characterised by their spectral properties. Ellagic acid and/or oak wood extracts slowed the decline in the levels of (+) -catechin and procyanidin B 1. In contrast, the decrease in malvidin- 3 -glucoside was more pronounced in the presence of ellagic acid and <b>oak</b> wood <b>chip</b> extracts. Furfural slowed (+) -catechin degradation, while breakdown of malvidin- 3 -glucoside was slightly more pronounced in the presence of guaiacol, furfural, vanillin and eugenol. (+) -Catechin, procyanidin B 1 and malvidin- 3 -glucoside did not significantly affect the rate of the degradation of ellagitannins during the storage time studied. Finally, new HPLC peaks were detected in the solutions containing (+) -catechin and ellagic acid, as well as with malvidin- 3 -glucoside with ellagic acid and oak wood extract. Conclusions : Malvidin 3 -glucoside and (+) -catechin and procyanidin B 1 presented distinct behaviours during time in the presence of volatile and non-volatile compounds from oak wood.

5000|$|Oak wood has a {{density of}} about [...] {{creating}} great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack {{because of its}} high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and {{in the construction of}} fine furniture. Oak wood, from Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war, until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and for veneer production. Barrels in which wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more powerful wine bouquets. <b>Oak</b> wood <b>chips</b> are used for smoking fish, meat, cheeses, and other foods.|$|R
2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of <b>oak</b> barrels and <b>chips</b> or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|R

The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between [...] "ripe" [...] and [...] "unripe" [...] tannins present in the grape. This [...] "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that [...] "riper" [...] tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as [...] "softer" [...] and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.|$|R
