5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was {{reported}} that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8, which is below the replacement rate. Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut. The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. The survey also reported that a third of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> underweight, while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.|$|E
50|$|For children, {{data from}} the Health Survey for England (HSE) {{conducted}} in 2014 and examining patterns of overweight and obesity among children aged 2-15, showed that 17% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> obese and an additional 14% <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> overweight.|$|R
40|$|Name: The {{level of}} {{physical}} fitness and the detection of the motor skills level of primary school age children. Objectives: To find out the current level {{of physical fitness}} and basic motor skills of primary school age children. Methods: The main method of the research was an observation. The study included 54 children (8. 9 ± 0. 6 years old, 31 girls and 23 boys). For the evaluation of physical fitness, we used the Unifittest (6 - 60) and for the evaluation of motor skills was used the MABC- 2 motor test. The Student's test and the Cohen's d effect size coefficient, were used for the evaluation of group differences. Results: In the MABC- 2 motor skills test, 22 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> achieved the result in a zone above the 84 th percentile, 20 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> between 51 - 84 th percentile, 50 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> in the range between 17 - 50 th percentile, 4 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> between 6 - 15 th percentile and another 4 % <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> in the range of < 5 percentile.
