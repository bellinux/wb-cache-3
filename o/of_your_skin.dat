2500|$|Giving Beowulf {{three out}} of four stars, Roger Ebert argues that the film is a satire of the {{original}} poem. Time magazine critic Richard Corliss describes the film as one with [...] "power and depth" [...] and suggests that the [...] "effects scenes look realer , more integrated into the visual fabric, because they meet the traced-over live-action elements halfway. It all suggests that this kind of a moviemaking is more than a stunt. By imagining the distant past so vividly, Zemeckis and his team prove that character capture has a future." [...] Corliss later named it the 10th best film of 2007. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers argues that “The eighth-century Beowulf, goosed into twenty-first century life by a screenplay from sci-fi guru Neil Gaiman and Pulp Fictions Roger Avary, will have you jumping out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> and begging for more... I've never seen a 3-D movie pop with this kind of clarity and oomph. It's outrageously entertaining." ...|$|E

I intended to question him concerning you, on my return; for I had no idea that, after making such a long journey, he would start back at once, but I found that he had ridden straight off, directly the note was handed to him.

I'd, mind you, sipped of the deadly old Huguenot too. I'd listened to your innocent prattle about the child kicking his toes out on death's cupboard door; what more likely thing in the world, then, than that with that moon, in that packed air, I should have swallowed the bait whole, and seen Sabathier in every crevice <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>skin?</b> I don't say there wasn't any resemblance; {{it was for the}} moment extraordinary; it was even when you were here the other night distinctly arresting.

'I am your man, captain,' he says, in that wonderful voice of his, 'but I am sorry to confess I have practically no clothes to my back. I have had to sell all my wardrobe {{to get a little}} food from day to day.' What a voice that man has got. Talk about moving stones! But people seem to get used to it. I had never seen him before, and, upon my word, I felt suddenly tears rising to my eyes. Luckily it was dusk. He was sitting very quiet under a tree in a native compound as thin as a lath, and when I peered down at him all he had on was an old cotton singlet and a pair of ragged pyjamas. I bought him six white suits and two pairs of canvas shoes. Can't clear the ship without a mate. Must have somebody. I am going on shore presently to sign him on, and I shall take him with me as I go back on board to get under way. Now, I am a lunatic--am I not? Mad, of course. Come on! Lay it on thick. Let yourself go. I like to see you get excited." ...|$|E

Another question, more specific {{to the topic of}} the study by Mercer et al, is: Does oxidative DNA damage actively promote atherosclerosis (and/or metabolic syndrome), or is DNA damage a result of these abnormalities? Conceptually, the theory is attractive. DNA damage occurs often.
