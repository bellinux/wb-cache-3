40|$|An eye {{tracking}} experiment {{was conducted in}} order to investigate the role of verb information in resolving structural ambiguity during sentence comprehension. Reading time was measured on sentences containing temporarily ambiguous noun phrases (e. g., “The athlete revealed the problem”) that were continued as tensed sentence (<b>S)</b> <b>complements</b> or noun phrase (NP) complements. Ambiguous noun phrases were preceded either by verbs occurring most frequently with NP complements (NPbiased) or verbs occurring most frequentlywith <b>S</b> <b>complements</b> (S-biased). Reading time was also measured on sentences containing unambiguous <b>S</b> <b>complements</b> preceded by either NP-biased or S-biased verbs.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comDigit recurrence operations mainly use redundant representation, mostly in signed-digit format. These operations generate results one digit per iteration from left to right. Since the final result has to be converted into 2 <b>s</b> <b>complement</b> format, to eliminate the end of operation conversion delay, on-the-fly algorithms are employed. These algorithms, with no use of carry propagating adders, convert the result into the conventional format as the signed-digits are generated. Some applications like rounding non-normalized results, positive or negative offsetting, coding and cryptography require not only the original result in 2 <b>s</b> <b>complement</b> format, but also to generate the original result summed with (n) ulp 1, where n is an integer, in the ordinary representation. This paper proposes a new algorithm applying to digit recurrence operations to generate that value on-the-fly. Hooman Nikmehr and Cheng-Chew Li...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} synthesis of a single-bit ternary fi nite impulse response fi lter with balanced ternary coeffi cients (ie. &ndash; 1, 0, + 1) implemented in VHDL on small commercial fi eld programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). A comparison is made between implementations based on 2 <b>s</b> <b>complement,</b> redundant binary signed digit (RBSD) and canonical signed digit (CSD) encoding techniques. Through simulation, the area and performance of an example fi lter are analysed using pipelined and non-pipelined modes for all three techniques. The simulation results show that, unlike in the equivalent multi-bit fi lters, CSD offers no advantages in single-bit sigma-delta modulated (ΣΔM) systems. Similarly, RBSD occupies twice the area and exhibits much poorer performance compared to a conventional 2 <b>s</b> <b>complement</b> representation due to the small symbol size in single-bit systems. These results demonstrate that simple, short word length ΣΔM fi lters will be useful in greatly {{reducing the number of}} general-purpose digital multipliers in general purpose digital signal processor applications using FPGA and especially ASIC...|$|R
