Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an <b>organometallic</b> <b>compound</b> called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other <b>organometallic</b> <b>compound.</b> Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E

25|$|The cobalt-containing Vitamin B12 (also {{known as}} cobalamin) catalyzes the {{transfer}} of methyl (−CH3) groups between two molecules, which involves the breaking of C−C bonds, {{a process that is}} energetically expensive in organic reactions. The metal ion lowers the activation energy for the process by forming a transient Co−CH3 bond. The structure of the coenzyme was famously determined by Dorothy Hodgkin and co-workers, for which she received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It consists of a cobalt(II) ion coordinated to four nitrogen atoms of a corrin ring and a fifth nitrogen atom from an imidazole group. In the resting state there is a Co−C sigma bond with the 5′ carbon atom of adenosine.

It is an <b>organometallic</b> <b>compound</b> {{as it has}} (haptic) covalent rhodium–carbon bonds.

500|$|Ferrocene is a redox-active <b>organometallic</b> <b>compound</b> {{which can}} be {{incorporated}} into various monomers and used to make polymers {{which can be}} tethered onto a surface. [...] Vinylferrocene (ferroceneylethene) can be prepared by a Wittig reaction and then polymerised to form polyvinylferrocene (PVFc), an analogue of polystyrene. [...] Another polymer which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. [...] Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups, as illustrated at right. [...] The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70 smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30, and the switching of wettability {{has been shown to be}} reversible. [...] In the PFcMA case, the effect of longer chains with more ferrocene groups (and also greater molar mass) has been investigated, and it was found that longer chains produce significantly larger contact angle reductions.|$|E
500|$|Applying {{valence bond}} theory to {{ferrocene}} by considering an Fe2+ centre and two cyclopentadienide anions (C5H5−), which {{are known to}} be aromatic according to Hückel's rule and hence highly stable, allowed correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule. Once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied and the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model proposed, the reasons for ferrocene's remarkable stability became clear. Ferrocene was not the first <b>organometallic</b> <b>compound</b> known [...] Zeise's salt, K·H2O was reported in 1831 and Mond's discovery of Ni(CO)4 occurred in 1888, but it was ferrocene's discovery that began organometallic chemistry as a separate area of chemistry. [...] It was so important that Wilkinson and Fischer shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry [...] "for their pioneering work, performed independently, on the chemistry of the organometallic, so called sandwich compounds". Ferrocene itself can be used as the backbone of a ligand, e.g. 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf). Ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the ferrocenium cation (Fc+); the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry.|$|E
