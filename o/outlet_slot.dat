Particle image velocimetry were performed with the objective to identify {{the dynamics of the}} large-scale circulations. In addition, we applied temperature measurements to determine the heat transport. Due to the unsteady nature of mixed convection in the present configuration, the velocity vector fields were subjected to a proper orthogonal decomposition in order to extract the predominant coherent structures. The analysis uncovers two structures consisting of three and four thermally induced large-scale circulations, which are arranged in longitudinal direction. Further, we found that the dynamics and the topology of the convection rolls strongly influences the heat transport between the container‘s inlet and outlet...|$|E

A lattice Boltzmann model for incompressible flow in porous media and Brinkman Forchheimer equation is used to simulate the problem.

40|$|The {{new concept}} of a {{rotating}} fluidized bed in a static geometry (RFB-SG) is presented. The rotating motion of the particle bed and the tangential fluidization of the solids are obtained by the tangential injection of the fluidization gas via multiple gas inlet slots in the outer cylindrical wall of the fluidization chamber. The solids experience a radially outwards centrifugal force. The gas, on the other hand, is forced to move radially inwards towards a chimney {{with one or more}} <b>outlet</b> <b>slots,</b> creating a radially inwards gas-solid drag force and fluidizing the solids radially. The new fluidization concept is experimentally investigated and proven using one and the same non-optimized fluidization chamber design with either large diameter, low density polymer particles or small diameter, higher density Alumina particles.

This thesis deals with an investigation of IRC influence on centrifugal compressor operational parameters. As a first, the various recirculation channel geometry was studied by using of CFD analysis on simplified computational models.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a new {{dispensing}} {{print head}} is introduced covering an operational width of 16 cm and therefore allowing for solar cell processing at industrial throughput rates. Like in previous ten nozzle versions, the interior paste flow {{was designed by}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using rheological parameters of applied Ag-pastes (commercially available pastes), including yield stress, shear thinning and wall slip behaviour. The novel print head features a homogeneous distribution of Ag-paste from an inlet supply with a diameter of Din = 2 mm to an <b>outlet</b> <b>slot</b> with a width of ws = 160 mm. A first printing test followed by geometrical characterization of the dispensed contacts revealed a distribution of the contact finger width of wf = 35 ± 1 μm across the whole wafer (156 x 156 mm 2) which demonstrates highest precision of the approach. The print head is directly integrated in an inline feasible dispensing platform, developed by ASYS GmbH. Respective nozzle plates can be customized to any desired front side grid regarding nozzle diameter, nozzle pitch and {{the total number of}} nozzles. In the actual version, the print head uses two strokes to print 100 contact fingers. Each of the 50 nozzles prints two adjacent contact fingers while moving up and down at a speed of up to vy = 700 mm/s. In a first solar cell test sequence with the new 6 ” print head, a maximum cell efficiency of η = 21. 2 % on industrially preprocessed Cz-PERC samples was reached which demonstrates a successful launching of the print head...|$|E
40|$|Task 1 {{involves}} {{fitting the}} conventional ElectroCore separator {{with a central}} electrode and evaluating the performance. The conventional ElectroCore, used in the field test at Plant Miller near Birmingham, Alabama, was shipped to the LSR laboratory where it was cleaned and inspected. The unit had been sitting unprotected outdoors and was badly rusted inside and out. After cleaning the unit {{to the best of}} our ability, the internal walls of the separator were still very rough compared to when the unit was new. Restoring the unit to its original condition was estimated to cost about $ 30, 000 and take about 16 weeks, so it was decided to modify the test procedures to be able to use the unit in its existing condition. Repairing the unit would put the project over budget and behind schedule. The rough walls would have little impact on the electrical characteristics or on the details of the flow geometry. It was believed that the rough walls would have a large impact on particle performance because the particles are expected to bounce along the wall before being extracted from the bleed flow <b>outlet</b> <b>slot.</b> The device is designed to prevent particles from adhering to the walls and it would be impossible to keep particles from adhering to the now roughened surface. The approach was to use the unit for evaluating the central electrode installation and to look at the gas flows within the unit but not to use it to measure particle separation efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{new concept}} of a {{rotating}} fluidized bed in a static geometry was numerically and experimentally studied. The particle bed can be both tangentially and radially fluidized by injecting the fluidization gas tangentially in the static fluidization chamber via multiple gas inlet slots located in its outer cylindrical wall. The tangential fluidization of the particles induces a rotating motion of the particle bed. As {{a result of the}} particle bed rotational motion, the solids experience a radially outwards centrifugal force. A radially inwards gas-solid drag force and radial fluidization of the particle bed can be introduced by forcing the fluidization gas to leave the fluidization chamber via a chimney with one or multiple gas <b>outlet</b> <b>slots,</b> positioned at the axis of the fluidization chamber. The solids can be continuously fed and removed {{in and out of the}} fluidization chamber via solids inlet and outlet holes in the front or back ends of the fluidization chamber. The fluidization patterns of low-density polymer particles with a large diameter and of high-density salt particles with a small diameter were experimentally studied in a 24 -cm diameter, 13. 5 -cm long non-optimized static fluidization chamber at different solids loadings. Scale-up to a 36 -cm diameter fluidization chamber was also studied. With both types of particles, a rotating fluidized bed and an acceptable gas-solid separation was obtained provided that the solids loading was sufficiently high. Slugging and channeling and a non-uniform distribution of the gas over the gas inlet slots to the fluidization chamber may occur at low solids loadings and can be detected via well-chosen pressure measurements. The fluidization patterns observed in the same fluidization chamber were completely different with the polymer particles and with the salt particles. The polymer particles tend to form a dense and uniform bed, its behavior being mainly characterized by tangential fluidization. The salt particles tend to form a less dense, bubbling fluidized bed that is both tangentially and radially fluidized. Computational fluid dynamics simulations give an improved insight in the gas and solid phase flow pattern...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} in biomass particulate solids {{has been increasing}} over the last decades for their wide use in thermochemical and biochemical processes to produce energy, biofuels and biochemicals. Solid biomass materials include {{a wide variety of}} materials of different natural source (forestry and agricultural wastes). Usually, biomass passes through a pre-processing step to obtain granular materials or powders. Industrial practice reports difficulties due to blockage in the discharge from storage units [1] and difficulties in predicting and controlling biomass flow rates in the feeding of the transformation units [2]. Solutions to these problems involving special ancillary equipment, that are proposed on empirical basis, increase the handling cost of low value materials so that the economic feasibility of the whole process becomes critical. These problems can be correctly addressed by the knowledge of the flow properties of solid biomass. However, standard characterization methods used for conventional granular solids are not always suitable for biomass materials. Moreover, it ought to be considered that current design procedures for hopper flow [3] were developed for particulates made of rigid and nonfibrous particles. The simple Mohr Coulomb approach followed in these procedures may be inadequate for lignocellulosic biomass, made of elastic irregularly shaped particles. The scope {{of this paper is to}} verify the standard design procedures on the flow condition of a plane silo discharging lignocellulosic granular biomass. Discharge experiments were carried out in a plane silo, of total volume of about 0. 3 m 3, formed by a parallelepiped bin and a wedge-shaped hopper in which it is possible to independently change both the hopper inclination angle and the width of the <b>outlet</b> <b>slot.</b> Two different woody biomass powders, a dry one (A) made of sawdust sieved below 4 mm, and a moist one (B) sieved below 2 mm were tested. The results of the design procedure by Jenike were compared with the experimental data obtained in the plane silo. The design procedure appeared sufficiently conservative to be used with confidence in the case of damp sawdust Wood Powder B. The same procedure turned out to predict critical outlet values very close to those experimentally found in the case of the dried sawdust Wood Powder B. Therefore, the application of the design procedure in this case requires the adoption of safety coefficients for a reliable hopper design for material flow. Several biomass particulates, such as those deriving from weeds, straws or canes, may present particle elongation ratio much larger than those of the tested materials and, therefore the characterization of the flow properties and the assessment of the silo design procedure for such materials deserve further studies.

40|$|Grid {{generation}} and Euler flow about fighter aircraft are described. A fighter aircraft geometry is specified by an area ruled fuselage with an internal duct, cranked delta wing or strake/wing combinations, canard and/or horizontal tail surfaces, and vertical tail surfaces. The initial step before grid {{generation and}} flow computation is {{the determination of}} a suitable grid topology. The external grid topology that has been applied is called a dual-block topology which is a patched C (exp 1) continuous multiple-block system where inner blocks cover the highly-swept part of a cranked wing or strake, rearward inner-part of the wing, and tail components. Outer-blocks cover {{the remainder of the}} fuselage, outer-part of the wing, canards and extend to the far field boundaries. The grid generation is based on transfinite interpolation with Lagrangian blending functions. This procedure has been applied to the Langley experimental fighter configuration and a modified F- 18 configuration. Supersonic flow between Mach 1. 3 and 2. 5 and angles of attack between 0 degrees and 10 degrees have been computed with associated Euler solvers based on the finite-volume approach. When coupling geometric details such as boundary layer diverter regions, duct regions with inlets and <b>outlets,</b> or <b>slots</b> with the general external grid, imposing C (exp 1) continuity can be extremely tedious. The approach taken here is to patch blocks together at common interfaces where there is no grid continuity, but enforce conservation in the finite-volume solution. The key to this technique is how to obtain the information required for a conservative interface. The Ramshaw technique which automates the computation of proportional areas of two overlapping grids on a planar surface and is suitable for coding was used. Researchers generated internal duct grids for the Langley experimental fighter configuration independent of the external grid topology, with a conservative interface at the inlet and outlet...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} the effects of a blowing ratio {{measured}} with narrowband liquid crystal in transonic experiments on the heat transfer characteristics of trailing edge cutback. The experimental results are compared and contrasted in terms of available data for traditional experiments with thermocouples. It is concluded that the blowing ratio exerts rather significant effects on film cooling effectiveness distribution of the rib center line. As the blowing ratio decreases, similar to the cooling effectiveness distribution curve of the slot center line, that of the rib center line makes a clockwise rotation about the end. When the blowing ratio increases, the regular film cooling effectiveness curve of the surface becomes rather smooth. On the whole measuring surface, the most intensive heat transfer occurs at the extended borderline of the slot and the rib, neither at the rib center line nor at the slot center line. The experimental results of cooling effectiveness measured with thermocouples are lower than those with liquid crystal. In addition, the transient experiments using narrowband liquid crystal can eliminate the higher errors of Nusselt numbers in measurements with thermocouples at the <b>slot</b> <b>outlet...</b>|$|R
40|$|Modern gas {{turbines}} always operate {{at a high}} level of inlet temperature. The current inlet temperature in the aircraft and heavy duty {{gas turbines}} is higher than the melting point of the guide vane material. Consequently, advanced cooling schemes must be developed to ensure the safe operation of gas turbines. In the current study, numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of the upstream slot geometry on the endwall cooling and phantom cooling of the vane suction side surface. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with the shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the simulations based on the validated turbulence model. The results indicate that the adiabatic cooling effectiveness in the upstream region of the stagnation is significantly increased by introducing the contoured upstream slot. However, the normal upstream slot obtains a relatively high adiabatic cooling effectiveness level in the downstream region of the stagnation. In the present research, the case with normalized amplitude A‾= 0. 75, initial phase angle φ= 45 ° achieves the largest overall adiabatic cooling effectiveness near the vane leading edge. In contrast, the case with A‾= 0. 75, φ= 30 ° attains the smallest overall adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall surface. Moreover, the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane suction side surface is relatively small relative to the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall. The case with the normal upstream slot achieves the largest phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane suction side surface compared with the contoured upstream slot. Overall, the contoured upstream slot significantly enhances the endwall cooling effectiveness by rearranging the distribution of the coolant mass flowrate at the <b>slot</b> <b>outlet...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the retch wire screen as a potential tool for collecting feces from water, by comparing its apparent digestibility estimates {{with that of the}} conventional stripping method. The retch wire screen is designed as a wire mesh for collecting or trapping feces that is removed from the tank along with the <b>outlet</b> water. The <b>slots</b> between the wire screens allow the passage of the outlet water while the trapped feces are collected from the wire screens for analysis. Three different diets with fishmeal, soybean meal and rapeseed meal were produced by extrusion. The diets were fed once a day to triplicate groups of rainbow trout with an average weight of 120 grams, reared in 14 oC freshwater. The experiment lasted for 22 days. Feces were obtained by careful stripping from the distal abdomen and collected from the wire screen 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes past feeding. Faecal dry matter, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) were analysed in diets and freeze dried feces samples, and apparent digestibilities (AD) were calculated. AD estimates of organic matter, nitrogen and sulphur obtained by collecting feces on the wire mesh collector were higher than AD estimates obtained by the stripping method, except for some values obtained for AD of carbon. This shows that leaching of nutrients from the feces was immediate. Compared to this initial leaching of nutrients, the leaching loss caused by prolonged collection times from 15 to 240 minutes was small. The percentage difference observed in AD estimate between stripping and feces collected with the retch wire screen were lower than values reported in previous methods of feces collection from water media. The relative ranking of the apparent digestibility among the 3 diets in the ANOVA analysis showed the same statistical ranking, and this may facilitate use of the tool, eventually by the employment of a correction factor. There were significant differences observed in the faecal dry matter among the diets for both methods of faecal collection. Soybean meal showed the lowest faecal dry matter among the diets. AD of nitrogen was significantly higher for the soybean meal diet than for the fishmeal diet when feces were obtained by stripping. Soybean meal also gave the highest estimates of nitrogen AD for feces collection at all the time intervals while rapeseed meal recorded the lowest Nitrogen AD. Rapeseed meal also showed the poorest digestibility in both methods of faecal collection for organic matter, carbon and sulphur. Sulphur AD obtained with the rapeseed meal diet by the stripping method was particularly low (54. 7 %), compared to the fishmeal and soybean meal diets that had 72. 4 and 70. 1 % respectively. The likely reason for this was attributed to low digestibility of sulphur containing amino acids in the rapeseed, possibly due to antinutrient factors...|$|R
40|$|Perth is {{a rapidly}} growing city {{and the demand for}} urban land has been {{steadily}} increasing over recent years (D. P. I., 2011) and the meeting of environmental legislations for storm-water management and floodplain strategic management is the kernel around which a variety of skills and deep speculation revolves. Technological advancement and multi-variable calculus have made possible the ability to predict how a given artefact will behave according to a defined series of variables in the environment within which the apparatus is expected to perform its duty. This is to introduce the key role that modelling resembles within the design process. In geological terms, it is known with deposition that Perth is accommodated over a rather variegated spectrum of soil types that ranges from sand, silt, clayey sand and clay. Due to this multi-faceted nature there are no standard design guidelines for subsoil drainage systems at date. A calibrated mathematical model can readily facilitate the design process and decision making thanks to its ability to provide groundwater mounding height values for environments with different physical and hydrogeological characteristics. Subsoil drainage is used throughout the world to control shallow groundwater levels to facilitate land use in both agricultural and urban development. The term subsoil implies that a buried pipe is used as opposed to an open drain, usually where land values are high. The primary mechanism by which subsoil drainage functions is the provision of an <b>outlet</b> from a <b>slotted</b> pipe system such that groundwater can flow by gravity, according to Darcy’s law, towards the pipe thus lowering groundwater levels. Subsoil drainage is usually constructed in parallel or sub-parallel lines, so that the water table mounds between the parallel drainage lines. Critical parameters determining whether a subsoil drainage system operates as intended are: the soil permeability, the volume of water to be drained in unit time and drain spacing. On the Swan Coastal Plain subsoil drainage has been used in urban developments where the water table has been shallow for decades, generally with success owing to the characteristically sandy soils and the relatively low rainfall in the South West of Western Australia. This paper describes a subsoil drainage experimental site in the City of Armadale, instrumented to monitor water table mounding between a set of parallel subsoil drains in imported sand fill in 2009 and 2010. The paper describes the data collected together with application of a suitable model to represent the relevant components of water flux, and an application of that model to design the subsoil drainage systems on the Swan Coastal Plain. It is the contention of this paper that a properly designed and calibrated model is to foresee the rise and decline of the perched water table under a given set of environmental conditions. Doing so, {{it will be possible to}} implement the Best Practice Technique (BPT) while addressing the need to avoid the oversizing of sand-fill requirements and consequent levitation of capital budget, maximise the security of assets and obviate the violation of buildings’ structural integrity. In terms of literature review, it has been deliberately decided to report references that are relevant to the Western Australia scenario solely: this is justified by the unique morpho-geological arrangement of the Swan Coastal Plain; in fact, overseas regulators for urban development may enforce building codes, approval schemes and land sub-divisional requirements that are not parallel to the Australian decisional criteria for such practices...|$|R
40|$|Gas-particle flows were modeled {{to account}} for {{coalescence}} and breakup of liquid metal oxide droplets dispersed within the gas phase. The one-way coupled population balance equation (PBE) describing the evolution of number concentration due to particle-particle interactions and aerodynamic forces was solved using the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) along with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS). The turbulent feature was assessed by Wilcox 2 ̆ 7 s k-ω equations. The fast Eulerian method {{was used to assess}} the slip velocity of the dispersed phase which holds a significant inertia. ^ Orthokinetic collision was considered under laminar and turbulent flow where the radial component of relative velocity between two colliding particles is a source of collision. Hydrodynamic and aerodynamic collision frequency functions for turbulent flow were obtained from prior studies and modified to take into account inertia of particles. For a general laminar movement of flow, hydrodynamic and aerodynamic collision frequency functions were derived for spherical particles. ^ The laminar hydrodynamic collision frequency kernel was derived for application to high speed (high Reynolds number) flows. The inclusion of influence of multidimensional and mean flow behavior permits application to flows in which shear layers are present and high Reynolds number flow which necessitates inclusion of compressibility effects. The new model agrees well with prior incompressible formulations. Results indicate that the compressible part of new shearing collision frequency has a significant effect on the collision kernel due to the contraction and dilatation effects of a fluid element. ^ The model was validated using historical data from particle collection experiments (and a correlation based on these data) in solid rocket motors. Considering the error bounds of correlation, the predicted mass mean diameter was in agreement with the measurements/correlation. Further validations performed to assess effects of chamber pressure, particle mass concentration, and nozzle scale showed a good agreement with empirical correlation and mass mean diameter variation trends were very similar to the behavior of the empirical correlation. ^ Parametric studies were performed on typical converging-diverging nozzles attached to rocket motors. The results of series of computations were presented to assess the effects of mean flow state (laminar vs turbulent), chamber pressure, inlet particle concentration and size, nozzle scale, contraction angle, divergence angle, and shock wave on resulting particle size evolution for nozzle simulations. The comparisons of laminar and turbulent effects on coalescence/breakup process showed that both effects are significant for these supersonic flows. As chamber pressure, inlet particle concentration, inlet particle size, and nozzle throat diameter increased, the resultant particle size also increased. The effect of nozzle geometries which is assessed based on contraction and divergence angle of nozzle wall showed that the particle size increases as the angles increases. Finally, it was found that there are periodic breakup-coalescence structures along the centerline as particles pass through compression/shock and expansion waves in the plume. ^ A series of numerical simulations were also performed to study the gas flow and particle agglomeration in a solid rocket motor with a radial slot. The D 43 distribution over the entire domain showed an increase along the axial direction and a thin band of large agglomerates were created downstream of the slot exit along the axial direction. Parametric studies were performed with respect to Mach number, mass flow ratio, step heights of downstream propellant, and inlet mass fraction of particle phase. Studies reveal that a stable recirculation zone (vena-contracta) is created at very high mass flow ratios when Mach number is small and at lower mass flow ratios when Mach number is relatively large. The investigation of the effects of Mach number and mass flow ratio on agglomeration showed that the maximum averaged D 43 is obtained at mid mass flow ratio with a constant Mach number at <b>slot</b> <b>outlet</b> and just after the vena contracta. All of above observations lead to conclude that the presence of large amount of metal oxide particles in rocket motors results in strong agglomeration of particles due to the shearing motion of flow and a significant inertia of particles and will have a significant influence on rocket performance. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the use of}} powder properties, determined from bench tests to predict powder flow behaviour in pneumatic conveying particularly in dense phase and super dense phase systems. The bench test powder properties examined included, particle size and distribution, bulk density and particle density, surface characteristics, fluidization and deaeration characteristics, powder cohesiveness, tensile strength and wall friction characteristics. The surface characteristics of various powders pneumatically conveyed were observed by an Electron Scanning Microscope. This information provides a good insight into flow characteristics. Differences in shape and surface explain vastly different conveying characteristics of supposedly similar powders. Particle size and distribution of various powders were measured by a Malvern Particle Sizer. It was found that particle size determines, to a large extent, powder cohesiveness, fluidization and deaeration characteristics. Furthermore, the effect of particle density, bulk density, permeability and compressibility on flow behaviour were examined. These properties were determined using a Beckman Pycnometer, a Jenike Compressibility Tester and a Jenike Permeability Tester. The observed fluidization characteristics not only revealed the powder classification with respect to Geldart 2 ̆ 7 s diagram, but also revealed the extent of powder cohesiveness and ease of segregation. An estimate of a powder 2 ̆ 7 s cohesion was conveniently evaluated by use of an Arch Tester. This tester consists of a perspex silo with a variable width <b>slotted</b> <b>outlet</b> opened by a chain drive mechanism. The powder remains undisturbed as the outlet is opened. Each powder bed examined was subject to a set deaeration time before opening the outlet. These results were compared with the cohesion measured in a direct shear tester. It was found that arch length and deaeration characteristics assists prediction of powder behaviour and cohesion. Tensile strengths were measured using an Ajax W. S. L. Tensile Tester under different extents of consolidation. This property was found to indicate cohesiveness and indirectly the air retention capacity of powders. The deaeration characteristics of powders were observed in a perspex cylinder suitably instrumented. In particular, pressure transducers were connected at the middle {{and bottom of the}} cylinder fitted with permeable and impermeable bases, respectively. For effective measurement of deaeration characteristics, {{it was found that the}} fill rate should be as fast as possible. These characteristics are important for assessing air retention characteristics of powders. Knowledge of the powder velocity is very important parameter in pneumatic conveying. For instance, if powders travel too slow, they drop out from the suspension and settle at the bottom of the pipe. This may lead to a blockage. Hence, it is necessary to convey powders above the critical settling velocity and they should not be conveyed with excessive velocity, which leads to powder degradation, pipeline wear and increased energy consumption. To effect velocity measurement, an optical fibre probe was developed on the cross-correlation principle using two sensing probes, a fixed distance apart. The probe consisted of eight fibres in total. Six projector fibres are connected to a light source, which emits light to the powder passing through a sight glass fitted in the conveying line. In this case, the conveying line formed part of an actual pilot scale pneumatic conveying rig. Reflected light from the travelling powder was transmitted by two receiver fibres and cross-correlated, using a HP 3721 A correlator, to determine the particle transit time between the two fibres and thus predict the powder velocity. Wall friction is another important factor contributing to the pressure drop in dense phase pneumatic conveying. The frictional properties of powders have an adverse effect in pneumatic conveying. These properties were evaluated under aerated conditions in a perspex tube by pushing powders upwards for different column lengths. Due to the importance of cohesion in governing a powder 2 ̆ 7 s dense phase flow characteristics or whether it can be transported by pneumatic conveying, the cohesion strengths predicted by the Arch Tester, Jenike Shear Tester and the Tensile Tester. Hence, cohesiveness ranking of the various powders tested was possible. A new phase diagram incorporating powder properties is proposed to predict a powder 2 ̆ 7 s an optimal pneumatic conveying mode. This thesis concludes by correlating the described bench measured powder properties with reported actual powder pneumatic conveying characteristics. The identified correlations provide useful information for future pneumatic conveying system designs...|$|R
