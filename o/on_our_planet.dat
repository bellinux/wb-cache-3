The model may facilitate explorations of task-layer diversity, go beyond GDP & body count in quantifying the impact of policy-changes & disasters, and help manage electronic idea-streams in ways that strengthen community networks. Empirical methods for acquiring task-layer multiplicity data are in their infancy, although experience-sampling via cell-phone button-clicks might be one place to start.

60|$|The very {{earliest}} existing fossils {{would lead}} us to believe what is otherwise quite probable, that life <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> began with very small forms--that it passed at first through a baby stage. The animals of the Cambrian period are almost all small mollusks, star-fishes, sponges, and other simple, primitive types of life. There were as yet no vertebrates of any sort, not even fishes, far less amphibians, reptiles, birds, or mammals. The veritable giants of the Cambrian world were the crustaceans, and especially the trilobites, which, nevertheless, hardly exceeded in size a good big modern lobster. The biggest trilobite is some two feet long; and though we cannot by any means {{say that this was}} really the largest form of animal life then existing, owing to the extremely broken nature of the geological record, we have at least no evidence that anything bigger as yet moved upon the face of the waters. The trilobites, which were a sort of triple-tailed crabs (to speak very popularly), began in the Cambrian Epoch, attained their culminating point in the Silurian, waned in the Devonian, and died out utterly in the Carboniferous seas.|$|E

But mark that Fourth individual of the Three Hundred and Fifty-four, who has a great deal. Fourth individual, called Comte de Saxe, {{who is now in}} that French Vanward a good way to east, was (must I again remind you!) the produce of the fair Aurora von Konigsmark, Sister of the Konigsmark who vanished instantaneously from the light of day at Hanover long since, and has never reappeared more. It was in search of him that Aurora, who was indeed a shining creature (terribly insolvent all her life, whose charms even Charles XII. durst not front), came to Dresden; and,--in this Comte de Saxe, men see the result. Tall enough, restless enough; most eupeptic, brisk, {{with a great deal of}} wild faculty,--running to waste, nearly all. There, with his black arched eyebrows, black swift physically smiling eyes, stands Monseigneur le Comte, one of the strongest-bodied and most dissolute-minded men now living <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>Planet.</b> He is now turned of forty: no man has been in such adventures, has swum through such seas of transcendent eupepticity determined to have its fill.

60|$|It is well, however, {{to bear in}} {{mind that}} the Lower Palæozoic rocks {{probably}} do not give us anything at all representative of the first beginnings of life <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>planet.</b> Unless a creature has bones {14} or other hard parts, unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough to make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is unlikely to leave any fossilized traces of its existence behind. To-day there are hundreds of thousands of species of small soft-bodied creatures in our world which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future geologists to discover. In the world's past, millions of millions of species of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished and passed away without a trace remaining. The waters of the warm and shallow lakes and seas of the so-called Azoic period may have teemed with an infinite variety {15} of lowly, jelly-like, shell-less and boneless creatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over the sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches. The Record of the Rocks is no more a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are a record of the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood. It is only when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a carapace or a lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the future, that it goes upon the Record. But in rocks of an age prior to those which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined carbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it may have been separated out from combination through the vital activities of unknown living things.|$|E

It explains how demographic shifts, economic growth, changing lifestyles, new technologies and geopolitical developments affect sustainable development. It discusses how the growing demand for energy contributes to the depletion of fossil fuels and climate change; how the growing demand for raw materials contributes to resource scarcity; and how current developments put increased pressure on the Earth’s biosphere and contribute to ecological degradation. Finally, it examines whether there are indications, such as the transformation of our normative framework, economic system and governance, that we are moving towards a more sustainable future...|$|R
