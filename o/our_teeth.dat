25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for <b>our</b> <b>teeth,</b> such as a chipped plate mixed in food, <b>our</b> <b>teeth</b> send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E
25|$|Michael Myerberg {{had just}} moved an {{experimental}} production from New Haven, Connecticut, to the Plymouth Theatre. Impressed by Scott's Sadie Thompson, he hired her as the understudy for Tallulah Bankhead, despite Bankhead's protests. Bankhead was the star of Thornton Wilder's new play, The Skin of <b>Our</b> <b>Teeth</b> (1942).|$|E
25|$|His play The Skin of <b>Our</b> <b>Teeth</b> {{opened in}} New York on November 18, 1942, {{featuring}} Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead. Again, the themes are familiar – the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the alternate history of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, {{that much of}} the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from James Joyce's last work.|$|E

Bankhead was the first white woman to be featured on the cover of Ebony magazine, {{and was one of the}} very few actresses and the only stage actress to have a cover on both Time and Life. In 1928, she was honored as one of the 10 most remarkable women in London. A resolution honoring her achievements was passed in the Alabama Legislature. Bankhead was (posthumously) one of the original members of the American Theater Hall of Fame inducted upon its establishment in 1972.|$|E

500|$|In 1948 Olivier led the Old Vic {{company on}} a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand. He played RichardIII, Sir Peter Teazle in Sheridan's The School for Scandal and Antrobus in Thornton Wilder's The Skin of <b>Our</b> <b>Teeth,</b> {{appearing}} alongside Leigh {{in the latter}} two plays. While Olivier was on the Australian tour and Richardson was in Hollywood, Esher terminated the contracts of the three directors, who {{were said to have}} [...] "resigned". Melvyn Bragg in a 1984 study of Olivier, and John Miller in the authorised biography of Richardson, both comment that Esher's action put back the establishment of a National Theatre for at least a decade. Looking back in 1971, Bernard Levin wrote that the Old Vic company of 1944 to 1948 [...] "was probably the most illustrious that has ever been assembled in this country". The Times said that the triumvirate's years were the greatest in the Old Vic's history; as The Guardian put it, [...] "the governors summarily sacked them in the interests of a more mediocre company spirit".|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the role}} of Westerners in the war between the Nguyễn and the Tây Sơn, and Pigneau's role in {{recruiting}} European assistance, Duyệt protected Vietnamese Catholic converts and Westerners from Minh Mạng's isolationalist and Confucian policies by disobeying the emperor's orders. In defense of the Christians, Duyệt wrote to Ming Mạng, [...] "We still have between <b>our</b> <b>teeth</b> the rice which the missionaries gave us when we were starving." [...] This came in response to an imperial edict that ordered missionaries to leave their areas of operation and move to the imperial city, ostensibly because the palace needed translators, but in reality to stop the Catholics from proselytizing. Whereas the government officials in central and northern Vietnam complied, Duyệt disobeyed the order and Minh Mạng was forced to bide his time. In the meantime, southern Christians were still publicly identifying themselves as such and praticising their beliefs without facing any obstacles from local officials. Choi said that [...] "From {{the point of view of}} Minh Mạng and his men, the land of Gia Định was thoroughly sheltered by Lê Văn Duyệt's prestige." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1948 Olivier was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in Richard III and also performed with Leigh in The School for Scandal and The Skin of <b>Our</b> <b>Teeth.</b> The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to [...] "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had [...] "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage". By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, [...] "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later, he would observe that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Tooth {{segmentation}} on {{dental model}} {{is an essential}} step of computer-aided-design systems for orthodontic virtual treatment planning. However, fast and accurate identifying cutting boundary to separate teeth from dental model still remains a challenge, due to various geometrical shapes of teeth, complex tooth arrangements, different dental model qualities, and varying degrees of crowding problems. Most segmentation approaches presented before {{are not able to}} achieve a balance between fine segmentation results and simple operating procedures with less time consumption. In this article, we present a novel, effective and efficient framework that achieves tooth segmentation based on a segmentation field, which is solved by a linear system defined by a discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. A set of contour lines are sampled from the smooth scalar field, and candidate cutting boundaries can be detected from concave regions with large variations of field data. The sensitivity to concave seams of the segmentation field facilitates effective tooth partition, as well as avoids obtaining appropriate curvature threshold value, which is unreliable in some case. <b>Our</b> <b>tooth</b> segmentation algorithm is robust to dental models with low quality, as well as is effective to dental models with different levels of crowding problems. The experiments, including segmentation tests of varying dental models with different complexity, experiments on dental meshes with different modeling resolutions and surface noises and comparison between our method and the morphologic skeleton segmentation method are conducted, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our method...|$|R

40|$|Classical tooth {{development}} {{theory suggests}} that dental papilla cells (DPCs) are the precursor cells of odontoblasts, which are responsible for dentin development. However, our previous {{studies have indicated that}} dental follicle cells (DFCs) can differentiate into odontoblasts. To further <b>our</b> understanding of <b>tooth</b> development, and the differences in dentinogenesis between DFCs and DPCs, the odontogenic differentiation of DFCs and DPCs was characterized in vitro and in vivo. DFCs and DPCs were individually combined with treated dentin matrix (TDM) before they were subcutaneously implanted into the dorsum of mice for 8 weeks. Results showed that 12 proteins were significantly differential, and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT 1), Isoform 2 of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -alpha (HIF 1 A) and Isoform 1 of annexin A 2 (ANXA 2), were the most significantly differential proteins. These proteins are related to regulation of bone balance, angiogenesis and cell survival in an anoxic environment. Both DFCs and DPCs express odontogenic, neurogenic and peridontogenic markers. Histological examination of the harvested grafts showed that both DFCs and DPCs form pulp-dentin/cementum-periodentium-like tissues in vivo. Hence, DFCs and DPCs have similar odontogenic differentiation potential in the presence of TDM.
