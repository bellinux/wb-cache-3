40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> high-resolution absorption spectroscopy for our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution and physical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaseous circumgalactic medium (CGM) that surrounds <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way.</b> Observational and theoretical studies indicate a high complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas kinematics and an extreme multi-phase nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CGM in low-redshift galaxies. High-precision absorption-line measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> gas environment thus are essential to explore fundamental parameters of circumgalactic gas in the local Universe, such as mass, chemical composition, and spatial distribution. We shortly review important characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> CGM and discuss recent results from our multi-wavelength observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magellanic Stream.

5|$|Actual proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way</b> {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope {{to study the}} Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E

5|$|The WHT {{has been}} used to make many {{significant}} new discoveries.

50|$|Alternatively, a {{hierarchical}} galaxy formation model is hypothesized under which a portion, possibly large, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> globular clusters would have originated in <b>the</b> accretion <b>of</b> other dwarf spheroidals like Sag DEG.

40|$|We derive new {{constraints}} on <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> dark matter halo, {{based on a}} set of halo stars from SDSS as kinematic tracers. Our sample comprises 2401 rigorously selected Blue Horizontal-Branch (BHB) halo stars drawn from SDSS DR- 6. To interpret these distributions, we compare them to matched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy formation simulations designed to resemble <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way,</b> which we presume to have an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. We then determine which value <b>of</b> V_cir(r) brings <b>the</b> observed distribution into agreement with the corresponding distributions from the simulations. This procedure results in an estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> circular velocity curve to ∼ 60 kpc, which is found to be slightly falling from <b>the</b> adopted value <b>of</b> 220 km s^- 1 at the Sun's location, and implies M(< 60 kpc) = 4. 0 ± 0. 7 × 10 ^ 11 M_. <b>The</b> radial dependence <b>of</b> V_cir(r), derived in statistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectations from an NFW dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components at its center. If we assume an NFW halo profile of characteristic concentration holds, we can use the observations to estimate <b>the</b> virial mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> dark matter halo, M_ vir= 1. 0 ^+ 0. 3 _- 0. 2 × 10 ^ 12 M_, which is lower than many previous estimates.

5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy.

5|$|As {{the more}} massive stars appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars.

5|$|Despite the {{prominence}} of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies in the Universe are dwarf galaxies.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{stringent}} {{constraints on the}} dark matter annihilation cross section are those derived from observations of dwarf galaxies by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. As current (e. g., Dark Energy Survey, DES) and future (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, LSST) optical imaging surveys discover more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> ultra-faint satellite galaxies, they may increase Fermi's sensitivity to dark matter annihilations. In this study, we use a semi-analytic model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> <b>Way's</b> satellite population to predict <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dwarfs likely to be discovered by DES and LSST, and project how these discoveries will impact Fermi's sensitivity to dark matter. While we find that modest improvements are likely, the dwarf galaxies discovered by DES and LSST are unlikely to increase Fermi's sensitivity {{by more than a}} factor of ~ 2 - 4. However, this outlook may be conservative, given that our model underpredicts <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> ultra-faint galaxies with large potential annihilation signals actually discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
