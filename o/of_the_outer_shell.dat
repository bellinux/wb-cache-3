5|$|The cysts of Azotobacter are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>shell</b> are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E

500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>shell,</b> called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanostructures}} are {{of considerable}} interest owing to their unique mechanical and electronic properties. Experimentally, {{a wide variety}} of different shapes are obtained, including both spherical and spheroidal carbon onions. A spheroid is an ellipsoid with two major axes equal and the term onion refers to a multi-layered composite structure. Assuming structures of either concentric spherical or ellipsoidal fullerenes comprising n layers, this paper examines the interaction energy between adjacent shells for both spherical and spheroidal carbon onions. The Lennard-Jones potential together with the continuum approximation is employed to determine the equilibrium spacing between two adjacent shells. We also determine analytical formulae for the potential energy which may be expressed either in terms of hypergeometric or Legendre functions. We find that the equilibrium spacing between shells decreases for shells further out from the inner core owing to <b>the</b> decreasing curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>shells</b> <b>of</b> a concentric structure.
