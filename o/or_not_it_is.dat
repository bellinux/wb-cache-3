5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Miralles {{and others}} {{reviewed}} the taxon maculata {{and concluded that}} the animal now known as Trachylepis maculata also belongs in the African clade, but they were unable to determine whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata. Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T.tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.|$|E

5|$|Whether {{the above}} details are {{accurate}} <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear that Svein, Olaf the Swede and Eirik had ample reason to oppose Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf had {{taken control of}} Viken in south Norway, an area long under Danish overlordship. Olaf and Svein had been in England together, but Olaf had made peace while Svein kept campaigning. Svein was on friendly terms with Olaf the Swede and connected to him by marriage, so the two were natural allies. Finally, Jarl Eirik had been driven from his patrimony by Olaf Tryggvason, as arguably had his father, Jarl Hakon, whom he may have wished to avenge.|$|E

Whether there are baptisms at this point <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> traditional for the congregation to renew the vows of their baptismal faith. This act is often sealed by the sprinkling of the congregation with holy water from the font. The Catholic sacrament of Confirmation is also celebrated at the Vigil.|$|E
25|$|Because tricolorability is {{a binary}} {{classification}} (a link is either tricolorable <b>or</b> <b>not),</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a relatively weak invariant.

In this case, the rule that at least two colors are used is relaxed and now every link has at least three 3-colorings (just color every arc the same color). In this case, a link is 3-colorable if it has more than three 3-colorings.|$|E

Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) is a mandatory Medicaid program for children {{that aims to}} focus on prevention, early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} medical conditions.

25|$|The {{ambiguous}} {{character of}} the axioms as originally formulated by Euclid {{makes it possible for}} different commentators to disagree about some of their other implications for the structure of space, such as whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> infinite (see below) and what its topology is. Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in elliptic geometry), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a torus for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).|$|E
