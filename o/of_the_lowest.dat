2500|$|By 12:00 pm, <b>the</b> {{deepening}} surface <b>low</b> {{was centered}} over south-central Missouri, the shortwave axis was moving easterly and oriented over eastern Oklahoma, and the dryline was rapidly advancing eastward directly south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> as <b>the</b> warm front slowly shifted northward situated due east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>low.</b> Morning clouds cleared by midday across much <b>of</b> where <b>the</b> Tri-State Tornado would track.

However, no research has tested realistic and more natural stooped work conditions with human subjects in <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biomechanical responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> back in prolonged stooping. The {{current study was}} aimed to explore various biomechanical responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> back in more realistic and work-related loading and posture conditions of prolonged stooping. Twenty two subjects performed stooped work tasks for 7 min with periodic micro-breaks in upright standing, and various measures for assessing biomechanical responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> back were obtained before, during and immediately after the stooped work period. Study results found significant increases (p < 0. 05) in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> lumbar flexion and myoelectric activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> back muscles after the stooped work period. During stooped work, <b>the</b> <b>low</b> back extensor muscles did not show flexion-relaxation.
