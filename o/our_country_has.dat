Phan appealed to Vietnamese nationalist sentiment, recalling his country's stubborn resistance to Chinese aggression. He cited defensive wars against the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, asking why a country [...] "a thousand times more powerful" [...] could not annex Vietnam. Phan concluded that it was [...] "because the destiny of <b>our</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> been willed by Heaven itself".|$|E
500|$|By now {{desperate for}} some {{profitable}} activity, Morrell made some money by displaying Dako and Monday to a fascinated public. The only maritime opportunity available {{was to take}} a cargo to Cádiz, which he was obliged to accept. [...] He left Manila on January 13, 1831, taking his captives with him. When Antarctic reached Cádiz five months later the port was under quarantine and closed. He was forced to discharge the cargo in Bordeaux, where Dako and Monday, rumored in the town to be cannibals, again attracted great curiosity. [...] Antarctic finally reached New York on August 27, 1831; [...] despite his lack of commercial success, Morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in the Pacific. [...] "I could, with only a modest share of patronage... open a new avenue of trade more lucrative than any that <b>our</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever yet enjoyed, and further, {{it would be in}} my power, and mine alone, to secure the monopoly for any term I pleased."

Immediately after the crisis, Sondhi furiously attacked the Democrat-led government over its {{management of the}} economic recovery. With the election of Thaksin Shinawatra as Prime Minister in 2001, several of Sondhi's associates became leaders in the new government. His banker, Viroj Nualkhair, became president of state-owned Krung Thai Bank and gave {{more than a billion}} baht in [...] "debt forgiveness" [...] to Sondhi, allowing him to emerge from bankruptcy.

[...] Mary Anne Sharkey, Webb's editor at The Plain Dealer, told writer Alicia Shepard in 1997 that Webb was known as 'the carpenter' [...] "because he had everything nailed down.

We look upon {{him as one}} of the few men of indisputable genius to whom <b>our</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> as yet given birth. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, [...] "Nathaniel Hawthorne's reputation as a writer is a very pleasing fact, because his writing is not good for anything, and this is a tribute to the man." [...] Henry James praised Hawthorne, saying, [...] "The fine thing in Hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychology, and that, in his way, he tried to become familiar with it." [...] Poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote that he admired the [...] "weird and subtle beauty" [...] in Hawthorne's tales.

In this long interval, too long to be measured by the standard of months, and falling more properly in the category of cycles, the drama of human society has moved with accelerated pace.
