60|$|Two {{days later}} (July 17) the Lords passed what Sir Roundell Palmer called “their ill-advised resolution.” On July 18 the cabinet met and {{resolved}} to recommend the cancelling {{of the old}} warrant regulating purchase, by a new warrant abolishing purchase. It has been said or implied that this proceeding was forced imperiously upon the Queen. I find no evidence of this. In the language of Lord Halifax, the minister in attendance, writing to Mr. Gladstone from Osborne (July 19, 1871), the Queen “made no sort of difficulty in signing the warrant” after the case had been explained. In {{the course of the}} day she sent to tell Lord Halifax, that as it was a strong exercise of her power in apparent opposition to the House of Lords, she should like to have some more formal expression of the advice of the cabinet than was contained in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>letter</b> from the prime minister, dealing with this among other matters. Ministers agreed that the Queen had a fair right to have their advice on such a point of executive action on her part, recorded in a formal and deliberate submission of their opinion. The advice was at once clothed in the definite form of a minute.|$|E

In proportion as international commerce developed and the Jewish interests increased, the income of the letter-carrier became correspondingly larger.

5000|$|Reluctant to antagonize {{potential}} {{freight customers}} by refusing letters, but {{not wishing to}} interrupt company operations for free mail carriage, the company's purser, C.H.

[...] (for Upper Columbia Company) and the denomination of 5 cents were printed. One thousand more [...] "labels" [...] with just the initials [...] "U.C" [...] were also printed. An <b>ordinary</b> <b>letter</b> in those days cost 3 cents to send, so the Upper Columbia Company's [...] "stamps" [...] were considerably more than regular postage. The idea {{seems to have been}} to discourage the use of the steamer for mail, and perhaps to make a little money on the side. The details of how stamps and labels were used are not clear, but clearly some did pass through the Canadian mails with additional official postage stamps also affixed.

A return of £9,000,000 was secured by stamp duties. So-called non-tax revenue largely increased, owing to {{the extension of the}} postal and telegraphic services. The real gain was not so great, as out of gross receipts of £22,000,000 over £17,500,000 is absorbed in expenses, while the carriage of <b>ordinary</b> <b>letters</b> seems to be the only profitable part of these services. Crown lands and rights (such as vintage charges) were of even less financial value.|$|R

40|$|Preface: In {{the year}} 189 —, I {{undertook}} {{an expedition to}} Queensland, in company with an old friend, ARTHUR SOMERS BRADFORD, who I deeply regret to say died shortly after his return to England. If my style of describing my travels and adventures should appear somewhat crude, I must ask my readers to extend their indulgence to one who is more accustomed to handle a gun than a pen, and to writing an <b>ordinary</b> <b>letter</b> than a manuscript for the publisher. However, I have been persuaded by friends who are better acquainted with the literary world than myself to write an account of my travels in a country so little known to the ordinary traveller as Northern Queensland. Most of the works hitherto published have been descriptions of Southern Australia, whereas my time was mostly spent in Northern Queensland and {{the borders of the}} York Peninsula, where the Australian aborigines are chiefly cannibals, and have scarcely emerged from the Stone Age in the history of their development. My intention is to lay before my readers a faithful account of my travels, camp life in the bush the manners and customs of the natives as I have observed them, well knowing that before long the aborigines will have disappeared {{from the face of the}} earth. In concluding these preliminary remarks, I wish to express my sincere thanks to those friends who have assisted me in my work, and to couple with them the name of my faithful friend and companion, ARTHUR BRADFORD, whose skill and ability as a medical man, and whose patience and assistance during many a trying time, will never be forgotten.

40|$|We all receive letters, ads, {{bills and}} invoices. While all this mail {{may seem to}} be increasing, it is in fact mainly the {{personalized}} advertisements sent by aspiring direc t marketers that we get more often, whereas many orders, bills and invoices have bee n routed electronically through redesigned business processes. By that, ordinary busines s mail have already been replaced by telefax and electronic data interchange (EDI), an d the same substitution effect will hit us customers as soon as companies switch to cal l centers and the Internet for electronic commerce. The objective of this thesis is to find out, first, the impact of the expansion of electronic communication on letter services and second, the most important criteria for selecting a communication mode. We focus on targeted communication, leaving out mass communication. More specifically, the communication modes studied are <b>ordinary</b> <b>letter,</b> hybrid letter, telephone, telefax, electronic mail (eMail), EDI and the Inter - net. The methods used are econometric modeling based on operator statistics and surveys based on user interviews. The results indicate that about 40 percent of 1 st and 2 nd class letter mail has already been replaced by electronic communication means in Finland, and the substitutio n process will continue at an increasing pace. The most important substitute so far has been telefax, but eMail is expected to take over soon. As a counter-argument against the substitution effect has presented that some electronic communication means, especially the telephone, actually has generated further demand for letters. Our result s show that this effect really has existed, but has tapered off during the last two-thre e decades. There is also competition between the electronic modes of communication. In particular, eMail has challenged telefax lately, indicating that the telefax machine i s reaching the peak of its life cycle. In the surveys users mentioned, the advantages of letter mail are still its data security, personal nature and legal capacity. In the case of electronic messages, there still i s some distrust as to whether they will reach the intended recipient and a fear that outsiders will gain access to them. A missing legal capacity, such as the lack of an electronic signature, seems to hinder the use of many electronic devices in targeted communication. A conclusion based on the results is that we live a transitional period before a radica l change in the field of targeted communication will take place. The hybrid network solutions and information services which make use of different digital networks simultaneously will be the prevailing trend. The postal service organizations can not slow down this development nor would it pay off Instead of relying on the survival of th e traditional letter mail services alone, the postal organizations should develop new hybrid communication services and through partnerships offer even purely electroni c communication service...|$|E
