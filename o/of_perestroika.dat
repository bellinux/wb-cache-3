At the election on 12 June 1991, he gained 13,395,335 votes, equal to 16.9% of the electorate. Boris Yeltsin beat him decisively with 57%. Ryzhkov's vice presidential candidate was Boris Gromov, a Soviet war veteran who led the Soviet military during {{the final stages of}} the war in Afghanistan. Most of Ryzhkov's votes came from the countryside, while he had hoped to win over voters who were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result <b>of</b> <b>perestroika</b> and Gorbachev's leadership, even though the latter supported his candidacy.|$|E

50|$|Perestroika allowed more {{independent}} actions from various ministries and introduced some market-like reforms. The goal <b>of</b> the <b>perestroika,</b> however, {{was not to}} end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better {{meet the needs of}} Soviet citizens. The process <b>of</b> implementing <b>perestroika</b> arguably exacerbated already existing political, social, and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and no doubt helped to further nationalism in the constituent republics. Perestroika and resistance to it are often cited as major catalysts leading to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|R

25|$|Under the {{pressure}} of the events that led to the Mineriads, his political stance has veered with time: from a proponent <b>of</b> <b>Perestroika,</b> Iliescu recast himself as a Western European social democrat. The main debate around the subject of his commitment to such ideals is linked to the special conditions in Romania, and especially to the strong nationalist and autarkic attitude visible within the Ceaușescu regime. Critics have pointed out that, unlike most communist-to-social democrat changes in the Eastern bloc, Romania's tended to retain various cornerstones.|$|E

25|$|Gorbachev {{calls for}} a kind <b>of</b> <b>perestroika</b> or {{restructuring}} of societies around the world, starting in particular {{with that of the}} United States, because he is of the view that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 shows that the Washington Consensus economic model is a failure that will sooner or later have to be replaced. According to Gorbachev, countries that have rejected the Washington Consensus and the International Monetary Fund approach to economic development, such as Brazil and China, have done far better economically on the whole and achieved far fairer results for the average citizen than countries that have accepted it.|$|E
