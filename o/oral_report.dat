25|$|The scene dissolves into Queens High School where Peter Parker is {{presenting}} an <b>oral</b> <b>report</b> on Arachne. His questions prompt {{the teacher to}} assign the entire class a ten-page report, which they must work on over the weekend. As revenge, Flash Thompson and the other bullies at the school begin to physically and verbally abuse Peter ("Bullying by Numbers"). He walks home beaten and alone, until he runs into his next door neighbor, crush, and Flash's girlfriend, Mary Jane. They each go into their separate homes and have arguments with their guardians: Mary Jane's father tries to beat her, while Peter feels his Uncle Ben is trying to replace his dead father. Both teenagers long for escape ("No More").|$|E
2500|$|Taboos {{are most}} urgent for {{avoiding}} harm and losses. Inner Commands of the Book of Changes, Ch'ih-sung tzu's Classic, and The Life-dealing Amulets of the Ho-t'u-chi are unanimous {{in saying that}} the gods of heaven and earth who {{are in charge of}} misdeeds make deductions from people's three-day reckonings according to the degree of their wrongdoing. As these reckonings decrease, a man becomes poorer and falls ill; frequently he suffers anxiety. When no more are left, he dies. Since there are hundreds of things that may give rise to deductions, I cannot give a complete account. It is also said that there are Three Corpses [...] in our bodies, which, though not corporeal, actually are of a type with our inner, ethereal breaths, the powers, the ghosts, and the gods [...] They want us to die prematurely. (After death they become a man's ghost and move about at will to where sacrifices and libations are being offered.) Therefore, every fifty-seventh day of the sixty-day cycle they mount to heaven and personally report our misdeeds to the Director of Fates. Further, during the night of {{the last day of the}} month the hearth god also ascends to heaven and makes an <b>oral</b> <b>report</b> of a man's wrongs. For the more important misdeeds [...] a whole period of three hundred days is deducted. For the minor ones they deduct one reckoning , a reckoning being three days. Personally, I have not yet been able to determine whether this is really so or not, but that is because the ways of heaven are obscure, and ghosts and gods are hard to understand. (6, tr. Ware 1966:115-6) ...|$|E

Before this person the party halted, and {{one of the}} men who had brought them made what seemed to be an <b>oral</b> <b>report.</b> Whether they were before a judge, a military officer, or a civil dignitary they could not know, but evidently he was a man of authority, for, after listening to whatever recital was being made to him the while he closely scrutinized the two captives, he made a single futile attempt to converse with them and then issued some curt orders to him who had made the report.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{failure to}} use records in sales reporting across about 12, 000 store owners {{participating in a}} retail measurement panel in a Southeast Asian country. Reported sales based on the storekeeper’s memory (<b>oral</b> <b>reports)</b> were lower than those from records, as expected. More surprisingly, <b>oral</b> <b>reports</b> acted {{as a supplement to}} record-based reports at the same store, such that stores that had <b>oral</b> <b>reports</b> had higher total sales than those with invoices. Although stores were expected to either have or not have a reliable record system, many stores used both. Findings varied over individual categories of products. Little research has examined the quality of reports of retail (consumer) sales from store owners in non-western countries. The paper suggests that improving data collection tools, rather than a single statistical adjustment approach, may be a more fruitful avenue for reducing measurement error in sales reports...|$|R
40|$|Extension and {{creative}} homework {{are discussed in}} this paper. Extension homework is assigned in order to transfer an idea or skill to a new or different situation. This form of homework {{is one way to}} develop reasoning and critical thinking skills. Examples of this type of homework are book and article reports. Creative homework requires students to compile skills and concepts in new and different ways. Examples of creative homework are surveys and <b>oral</b> <b>reports.</b> Students at any grade level can do surveys involving problem-solving in social situations. A creative homework assignment may be one in which students learn about some local, state, national, or international problem by interviewing their parents, neighbors, or city officials. Another way to encourage creativity is to have students work together in research projects that culminate in <b>oral</b> <b>reports.</b> Creative homework often involves the process of analysis. Forms for book, article, and <b>oral</b> <b>reports,</b> and surveys are provided. (SM) * Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made * * from the original document. ...|$|R
60|$|It is usual {{to explain}} the raps by a theory that the 'medium' {{produces}} them through cracking his, or her, knee-joints. It may thus be argued that Sister Anthoinette discovered this trick, or was taught the trick, and that the tradition of her performance, being widely circulated in Montalembert's quarto, and by <b>oral</b> <b>report,</b> inspired later rappers, such as Miss Kate Fox, Miss 'C.' Davis, Miss Hetty Wesley, the gentlewoman at Mr. Paschal's, Mr. Mompesson's 'modest little girls,' Daniel Home, and Miss Margaret Wilson of Galashiels. Miss Wilson's uncle came one day to Mr. Wilkie, the minister, and told him the devil was at his house, for, said he, 'there is an odd knocking about the bed where my niece lies'. Whereupon the minister went with him, and found it so. 'She, rising from her bed, sat down to supper, and from below {{there was such a}} knocking up as bred fear to all that were present. This knocking was just under her chair, where it was not possible for any mortal to knock up.' When Miss Wilson went to bed, and was in a deep sleep, 'her body was so lifted up that many strong men were not able to keep it down'. {114a} The explanation about cracking the knee- joints hardly covers the levitations, or accounts for the tremendous noise which surrounded Sister Anthoinette at matins, or for the bright light, a common spiritualistic phenomenon. Margaret Wilson was about twelve years of age. If it be alleged that little girls have a traditional method of imposture, even that is a curious and interesting fact in human nature.|$|E
