50|$|The {{original}} POWER microprocessor, one of {{the first}} superscalar RISC implementations, was a high performance, multi-chip design. IBM soon realized that a single-chip microprocessor was needed in order to scale its RS/6000 line from lower-end to high-end machines. Work on a <b>one-chip</b> POWER microprocessor, designated the RSC (RISC Single Chip) began. In early 1991, IBM realized its design could potentially become a high-volume microprocessor used across the industry.|$|E
50|$|The TMS9900 was {{designed}} as a single chip version of the TI 990 minicomputer series, much like the Intersil 6100 was a single chip PDP-8 (12 bit), and the Fairchild 9440 and Data General mN601 were both <b>one-chip</b> versions of Data General's Nova. Unlike other 16-bit microprocessors such as the National Semiconductor IMP-16 or DEC LSI-11, some of which predated the TMS9900, the latter was a single-chip, self-contained 16-bit microprocessor.|$|E
50|$|However, the 88000 {{was already}} in production; Data General was {{shipping}} 88000 machines and Apple already had 88000 prototype machines running. The 88000 had also achieved a number of embedded design wins in telecom applications. If the new POWER <b>one-chip</b> version could be made bus-compatible at a hardware level with the 88000, that would allow both Apple and Motorola to bring machines to market far faster since {{they would not have}} to redesign their board architecture.|$|E
50|$|Since the Kenbak-1 {{was invented}} {{before the first}} microprocessor, the machine didn't have a <b>one-chip</b> CPU but instead was based purely on {{small-scale}} integration TTL chips. The 8-bit machine offered 256 bytes of memory, implemented on Intel's type 1404 silicon gate MOS shift registers. The instruction cycle time was 1 microsecond (equivalent to an instruction clock speed of 1 MHz), but actual execution speed averaged below 1000 instructions per second due to architectural constraints such as slow access to serial memory.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Texas Instruments {{introduced}} the first single-chip LPC speech synthesizer. In 1976 TI began a feasibility study memory intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed.

This was used in several TI commercial products beginning with Speak & Spell which was introduced at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1978.

5000|$|According to DLP.com, the three-chip {{projectors}} used {{in movie}} theaters can produce 35 trillion colors [...] The human eye is suggested {{to be able}} to detect around 16 million colors , which is theoretically possible with the single chip solution. However, this high color precision does not mean that three-chip DLP projectors are capable of displaying the entire gamut of colors we can distinguish (this is fundamentally impossible with any system composing colors by adding three constant base colors). In contrast, it is the <b>one-chip</b> DLP projectors that have the advantage of allowing any number of primary colors in a sufficiently fast color filter wheel, and so the possibility of improved color gamuts is available.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{chipsets}} produced by SiS was the late 486-age chipset 496/497 which supported PCI bus among older ISA- and VLB-buses. Mainboards using this chipset and equipped with CPUs such as the Intel 80486DX4, AMD 5x86 or Cyrix Cx5x86 processors had performance and compatibility comparable with early Intel Pentium systems in addition to a lower price.After this late success, SiS continued positioning itself as a budget chipset producer. The company emphasized high integration to minimize the cost to implement their solutions. As such, SiS <b>one-chip</b> mainboard chipsets that included integrated video, such as the Socket 7-based SiS 5596, SiS 5598, and SiS 530 along with the Slot 1-based SiS 620.
