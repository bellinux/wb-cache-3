Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E

25|$|Further acclaim {{greeted the}} {{director}} in 1996 with Les voleurs (Thieves) (1996), an ambitious and complex crime drama. The film jumps through time and switches narrative perspectives in a Rashomon-style exploring family and amorous ties.

This film earned Téchiné nominations for the César and Golden Palme at Cannes, {{as well as a}} host of other honors.|$|E
25|$|Fairies are {{generally}} described as human in appearance and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> {{have been recorded}} for centuries, but occur alongside the human-sized beings; these have been depicted as {{ranging in size from}} very tiny up {{to the size of a}} human child. Even with these small fairies, however, their small size may be magically assumed rather than constant. Some fairies though normally quite small were able to dilate their figures to imitate humans. On Orkney they were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey, and sometimes seen in armour.|$|E
50|$|As {{in some of}} {{his other}} early novels, Gilbert {{does not seem to have}} made up his mind about what kind of a {{narrative}} style to use. It is a third-person narrative, told by an omniscient narrator, but it veers between straightforward description, somewhat chatty semi-humorousness or facetiousness, and occasional hard-boiled grimness. It might in fact, be an early prototype of what later came to be called a caper novel. However, befitting Gilbert's status as a practicing solicitor, there are also numerous scenes set in <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> of court <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> and a number of other scenes revolving around finance and financial institutions, all of them done with his customary expertise.|$|R

40|$|Classical {{rationality}} as {{accepted by}} game theory assumes {{that a human}} chooser in a given moment has consistent preferences and beliefs and that actions result consistently from those preferences and beliefs, and moreover that these preferences, beliefs, and actions remain the same across equal choice moments. Since, as is widely found in prior experiments, subjects do not follow the predictions of classical rationality, behavioral game theorists have assumed consistent deviations from classical rationality by assigning to subjects certain dispositions— risk preference, cognitive abilities, social norms, etc. All of these theories are fundamentally cognitive theories, making claims about how individual human minds work when choosing.

[...] It was over a pseudonymous accusation of effeminacy that Andrade broke with Oswald de Andrade in 1929. [...] Macunaíma prefers women, but his constant state of belonging and not belonging is associated with sex.

30|$|Marble waste or sludge is an {{unavoidable}} material resulting from marble processing industries, where nearly every industry generates <b>one</b> of a <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> A waste <b>or</b> sludge {{can be defined}} as the substance by-products after fabrication and has no further value, especially with affluent developed economies [1]. The increasing amounts of waste and diminishing waste disposal sites, as well as the problems associated with the contamination from dangerous and toxic materials, are challenging to us and should be resolved successfully [2]. Storage and collection of waste are some of the more visible signs of successful or unsuccessful solid waste management systems. It is a serious matter as waste materials produce tangible effects on the soil and environmental system of most areas in the city of Karachi [3, 4]. If waste is not discarded properly on land, besides affecting plant, animal, and human health, trace elements contained in solid waste may be leached from the soil and enter either the ground or the water surface and contaminate it dangerously. Among the multitude of environmental problems faced by Pakistan, solid wastes have {{become one of the most}} prominent issues in the recent years, not only because of the increase in the amount, but mainly because of the lack of an efficient management system and monitoring associated with it.|$|R
60|$|There were a {{great many}} things which seem to us at the present day of very little consequence, which were then the {{subjects}} of endless disputes and of the most bitter animosity. For instance, one point was whether {{the place where the}} communion was to be administered should be called the communion table or the altar; and in what part of the church it should stand; and whether the person officiating should be called a priest or a clergyman; and whether he should wear <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> of dress <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> Great importance was attached to these things; but it was not on their own account, but on account of their bearing on the question whether the Lord's Supper was to be considered only a ceremony commemorative of Christ's death, or whether it was, whenever celebrated by a regularly authorized priest, a real renewal of the sacrifice of Christ, as the Catholics maintained. Calling the communion table an altar, and the officiating minister a priest, and clothing him in a sacerdotal garb, countenanced the idea of a renewal of the sacrifice of Christ. Laud and his co-adjutors urged the adoption of all these and similar usages. The Puritans detested them, because they detested and abhorred the doctrine which they seemed to imply.|$|R
30|$|Each {{person has}} varied {{opportunities}} she values, and mobility {{is required to}} reach them. In fact, the land use features define “the amount, quality and spatial distribution opportunities supplied at each destination (jobs, shops, health, social and recreational facilities, etc.), the demand for these opportunities at origin locations (e.g. where inhabitants live), and the confrontation of supply of and demand for opportunities, which may result in competition for activities with restricted capacity such as job and school vacancies and hospital beds” (Dijst et al. 2013, pp. 209 – 210). Each person has different capacities to freely move, depending on personal features {{as well as on}} the “possible mobilities according to place, time and other contextual constraints” (Kaufmann et al. 2004, p. 750). Transport systems—and the TransMilenio here discussed—contribute to these possible mobilities. Depending on a personal choice, each person can decide to put into practice such capacity to move, and accessibility to valued opportunities lies amongst its possible uses. Opportunities include a range of resources and activities necessary for the freedom that each individual has to lead <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> of life <b>or</b> <b>another</b> (Nussbaum and Sen 1993) and for the participation to social life. Identifying development with the possibility for everyone to flourish according to what she has reason to value (Nussbaum 2000), individual freedom becomes a social commitment (Sen 1999).|$|R

40|$|This thesis revisits {{the divide}} between {{information}} focus and contrastive focus in Spanish. This divide is said to manifest itself not only in meaning differences, but in surface structure as well, resulting in different syntactic and phonological realizations depending on the intended pragmatic function of a focused sentence. According to previous accounts, an utterance in which focus is expressed by dislocating the relevant element {{to the end of}} the sentence is assumed to signify information focus, while a strategy utilizing a specific prosody change on the focused element is said to express contrast. This work argues, in opposition to previous assumptions from the literature, that there is not a strict divide between the realization of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> of focus <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> and in fact, that these preconceived meaning divides are not themselves straightforward to characterize. Further, this work argues for the possibility that the choice of focus construction is highly influenced by speakers' communicative intentions and constraints. The conclusions reached in this thesis are the product of a combination of empirical and theoretical work. Empirical evidence is drawn from two sources: 1) data from an original elicitation experiment involving native speakers of Spanish producing focused constructions under different pragmatic situations; and 2) findings from the literature on on-line sentence processing studying focused constructions specifically. The first source of data points at the conclusion that the strict information-as-syntactic vs. contrast-as-phonological divide has no base in Spanish. The second source argues for the need for a more functionally-informed approach to focus constructions. A formal analysis of the data using the QUD framework also demonstrates that different kinds of focus can be represented under a single unified semantic approach...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1840s the Russian Slavophile {{movement}} {{divided into two}} branches. The old school followers led by the brothers Aksakov, Ivan Kireyevsky and Aleksey Khomyakov, grouped first around Moskovsky Sbornik, then Russkaya Beseda. Mikhail Pogodin's Moskvityanin {{became the center of}} the younger Slavophiles who were later labeled potchvenniky ('the soil-bound'), Apollon Grigoriev, Boris Almazov, and Alexander Ostrovsky among them. In 1850 Moskvityanin invited Pisemsky to join in and the latter promptly sent Ostrovsky his second novel The Simpleton he'd been working on throughout 1848. In November of that year {{the story of a young}} idealist who dies after his illusions have been destroyed, was published in Moskvityanin, to a critical and public acclaim. A year later Marriage of Passion (Брак по страсти) appeared in the same magazine, again praised by the reviewers. Now raised to the ranks of [...] "the best writers of our times", Pisemsky found his works compared to those of Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Alexander Ostrovsky. Pavel Annenkov remembered: I recall the impression Pisemsky's first two novels made upon me... How hilarious they seemed, what an abundance of comic situations there were and how the author made these characters funny without trying to impose any moral judgement upon them. The Russian provincial philistine community was shown at its most self-celebrational, it was brought under the light and made to look almost proud of its own wildness, its unique outrageousness. The comical nature of these sketches had nothing to do with the author's juxtaposing them with <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> of doctrine <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> The effect was achieved by showing the complacency with which all those ridiculous characters were leading their lives full of absurdity and moral looseness. The laughter that Pisemsky's stories provoked was different from that of Gogol, although, as it follows from our author's autobiography, his initial efforts reflected much of Gogol and his work. Pisemsky's laughter stripped its subject down to the vulgar core, and to expect anything like [...] "hidden tears" [...] in it would be impossible. His was the joviality of, as it were, physiological nature, which is extremely rare with modern writers and more typical to the ancient Roman comedy, Middle Age farce or our common man's re-telling of some low-brow joke." ...|$|R
