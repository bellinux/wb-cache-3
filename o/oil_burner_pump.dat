The building also contained three secondary concrete fuel oil storage tanks with a capacity of [...] that were connected to the main [...] storage tank. Structures 16 and 43 were for fuel oil storage. Fuel oil would be unloaded at the fuel oil transfer house, building 43, a ×, {{reinforced concrete}} building, from railroad tank cars.

The steam was used for both heating and hot water heating.|$|R
5000|$|The factory {{was built}} on a 70 acre plot of land. The company {{originally}} was a manufacturer of agricultural implements. Its rapid growth was spurred by Bettendorf’s design of a one-piece railroad truck frame that eliminated bolts, which would work loose as the train was moving and cause delays or derailments. [...] The new frame was cast from {{a single piece of}} steel and revolutionized the railroad industry. [...] By 1909 the building had grown to three times its original size. It contained two regenerative open-hearth basic steel furnaces, with a capacity of 25 tons of heat. They were able to output about one hundred tons of finished steel castings daily that were used {{in the construction of the}} railroad boxcars. A complete railroad car was built from raw materials in the east end of the plant to the finished product on the west end. [...] The company expanded in the early 20th century to manufacture <b>oil</b> <b>burners,</b> toys, water <b>pumps,</b> ice crushers and other products. The company also built the Meteor automobile. [...] Between 1903 and 1910 the workforce grew from 300 to 800 employees.|$|R

50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> is {{a heating}} device which burns #1, #2 and #6 heating oils, diesel fuel or other similar fuels. The fuel is {{atomized}} into a fine spray usually by forcing it under pressure through a nozzle {{which gives the}} resulting flame a specific flow rate, angle of spray and pattern (variations of a cone shape). This spray is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through around {{it at the end}} of a blast tube, by a fan driven by the <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> motor. The fuel pump is typically driven via a coupling connecting its shaft to that of the motor's. <b>Oil</b> <b>burners</b> also include combustion-proving devices to prevent out-of-control combustion - Primary Control; Safety Control; Cad Cell Control; Master Control; Fire-Eye Control are all common names for the 'combustion safety control'.|$|R

40|$|The BIOFLAM project {{intends to}} provide {{solutions}} to the problem of environmental impact of combustion of liquid fuels for heating purposes. <b>Oil</b> <b>burners</b> show up to date a very poor power modulation especially at low power outputs, as usually needed in domestic appliances. Liquid biofuels like FAME are also not compatible with conventional <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> technologies. Furthermore, the integration of <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> in wall-hung systems requires further burner size reductions. Within the EC-funded BIOFLAM project new liquid fuel fired condensing boilers are being developed showing such major features as a power modulation of at least 10 : 1, ultra low CO and NOx emissions over the entire power modulation range, significantly more compactness than conventional liquid fuel fired boilers and compatibility with renewable liquid fuels like FAME. In order to reach these goals new ceramic premixed liquid fuel burners were developed based on the combination of the innovative cool flame vaporization process and the novel porous medium burner concept. High temperature ceramics, condensing boiler technology with condense water neutralization and innovative burner controls with a power modulation were utilized, in order to realize all the principal advantages of the employed technologies...|$|R
