40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prognosis}} {{of recurrent}} or progressive medulloblastoma (MB) is still poor. This {{study was designed}} to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of combination therapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and oral etoposide (VP- 16) in children with progressive or relapsed MB. Given the oral administration of both drugs the regimen was administered outpatient. METHODS: A phase I trial was conducted to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TMZ and oral VP- 16. This orally administered combination was investigated by classical 3 + 3 design. Cohorts of patients were enrolled at four different levels: (1) TMZ 120 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 5 and VP- 16 50 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 8; (2) TMZ 150 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 5 and VP- 16 50 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 8; (3) TMZ 150 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 5 and VP- 16 50 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 10; (4) TMZ 150 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 5 and VP- 16 50 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 12. Therapy was administered in 28 -d courses. A total of 66 courses were administered to 14 patients with a median age of 5. 7 years. RESULTS: None of the 3 patients at dose levels 1 and 2 had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Of the 6 patients at dose level 3, 1 patient had DLT. At dose level 4, grade 4 thrombocytopaenia and neutropaenia were observed in the first 2 patients enrolled. Therefore, the MTD was established at dose level 3. CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose in children is TMZ 150 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 5 and VP- 16 50 mg/m(2) <b>on</b> <b>days</b> 1 - 10 every 28 d.
