5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on nuclear weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> design.|$|E
5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state. A search of his cabin {{revealed}} a cache <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb, ready for mailing. They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future. By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E

50|$|Issues {{with the}} {{originally}} released figures were raised following an appraisal <b>of</b> large scale <b>bombing</b> raids during the Second World War. A {{comparison of the}} Guernica figures with the figures of dead resulting from air attacks on major European cities during the Second World War exposed an anomaly. James Corum uses the figure of forty tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped on Guernica, and calculates that if the figure of 1654 dead is accepted as accurate then the raid caused 41 fatalities per ton <b>of</b> <b>bombs.</b> By way <b>of</b> comparison the Dresden air raid during February 1945 which saw 3,431 tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped on the city caused fewer deaths per ton of bombs: 7.2-10.2 fatalities per ton <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped. Corum, who ascribes {{the discrepancy between the}} high death toll reported at Guernica and in other cases such as Rotterdam to propaganda, {{goes on to say that}} for Guernica:...a realistic estimate on the high side <b>of</b> <b>bombing</b> effectiveness (7-12 fatalities per ton <b>of</b> <b>bombs)</b> would yield a figure of perhaps 300-400 fatalities in Guernica. This is certainly a bloody enough event, but reporting that a small town was bombed with a few hundred killed would not have had the same effect as reporting that a city was bombed with almost 1,700 dead".|$|R
5|$|On March 25, 2005, the Pacers {{played at}} The Palace {{for the first}} time since the brawl. The game was delayed 90 minutes after a series <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> threats were aimed at the Pacers locker room, but the game {{eventually}} started after no explosives were found. Two of the key figures in the original incident missed the game, as Artest was still suspended and O'Neal had an injured shoulder. In the game, the Pacers stopped the Pistons' twelve-game winning streak with a 94–81 win.|$|E
5|$|The 509th Composite Group had an {{authorized}} strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, {{almost all of}} whom eventually deployed to Tinian. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s. These aircraft were specially adapted to carry nuclear weapons, and were equipped with fuel-injected engines, Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> bay doors and other improvements.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo {{studied for}} the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After {{returning}} to India {{he took up}} various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and began increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested {{in the aftermath of}} a number <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.|$|E

50|$|Closing out {{the month}} of May, the 330th BG contributed 38 {{aircraft}} to a daylight raid against the Yokohama urban area. They dropped 203 tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> on the target {{out of a total}} of 621 tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped by the 131 aircraft on the raid.|$|R
50|$|The heavy {{footprint}} of US operations {{can also}} be seen in its bombing campaign. More than twice the tonnage <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped during the entire World War II Pacific War was deposited on the South by the US. Over 7,000,000 total tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> were delivered by the Americans. Some 60% of this burden fell within the territory of its ally, South Vietnam. Another 1.5 million tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> were unloaded on Laos and Cambodia. America's main enemy North Vietnam received approximately one million tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs,</b> or between 10-15% of the total. The bombs left over 25 million craters on {{an area the size of}} New Mexico (121,666 square miles), and heavily damaged over half the forests of South Vietnam and 60% of its hamlets. Overall, approximately three times the amount <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped in World War II were dropped on Vietnam as a whole, making it the most bombed country in history. Along with bombs some 400,000 tons of napalm were dropped and some 19.1 million gallons of herbicides were applied. Most of this amount, like that <b>of</b> air-delivered <b>bombs,</b> also fell on the territory of America's ally, South Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|Benbow {{returned}} to active naval service in September 1693, joining Thomas Phillips, the second engineer of the ordnance, in jointly commanding a flotilla <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> vessels to attack Saint-Malo. Benbow went aboard the 48-gun HMS Norwich {{and began the}} bombardment on 16 November. It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour. An {{attempt was made to}} bring her alongside the town walls, but she ran aground, was set on fire, and exploded. Despite the failure of the initial plan, considerable damage was done, and Benbow's forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disabled it, carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey. Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court-martial against Captain Henry Tourville, accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship in closer. There was no conviction though, as the mortars were proved to be defective.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{virtually}} all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in {{use for the}} storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By {{the end of the}} war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by {{the success}} of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion {{refurbishment}} a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby. Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at Harrods'.|$|E

2500|$|Five nights later, Birmingham {{was hit by}} 369 bombers from KG 54, KG26, and KG55. By the end of November, 1,100 bombers were {{available}} for night raids. [...] An average of 200 were able to strike per night. This weight of attack went on for two months, with the Luftwaffe dropping [...] <b>of</b> <b>bombs.</b> In November 1940, 6,000 sorties and 23 major attacks (more than 100 tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> dropped) were flown. Two heavy ( [...] <b>of</b> <b>bombs)</b> attacks were also flown. In December, only 11 major and five heavy attacks were made.|$|R
50|$|In 11 days <b>of</b> {{concentrated}} <b>bombing,</b> B-52s {{had completed}} 729 sorties and dropped 13,640 tonnes (15,000 tons) <b>of</b> <b>bombs.</b> The North Vietnamese claimed that almost 1,400 civilians were killed.|$|R
5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|The final wartime Silverplates {{incorporated}} all technical {{improvements to}} B-29 aircraft, {{as well as}} the final series of Silverplate modifications that included Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, and pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> bay doors. The British F-type bomb release and G-type attachment were installed, along with dual electrical and mechanical bomb release mechanisms. Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine problems, and the early Silverplate bombers were no exception. One was written off after being badly damaged {{as a result of an}} engine fire in February 1945. The fuel-injected Wright R-3350-41 engines in the later model bombers delivered in July and August 1945 were greatly improved and far more reliable. This was an important factor in the success of the 509th Composite Group's operations.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{was largely}} {{turned over to}} the {{production}} of war materiel during the Second World War, such as the Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mosquito and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey Bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.|$|E

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E
5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> design, known as implosion, had begun earlier {{under the direction}} of the physicist Seth Neddermeyer. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material. He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
5|$|By late June and {{throughout}} July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat. Nonetheless, the increasing {{intensity of the}} conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation <b>of</b> <b>bomb</b> shelters in Zadar by city officials. Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) authorities called up three Territorial Defence units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July, one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area, while the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks {{by the end of the}} month. In late July, a paramilitary group, led by Miro Barešić and formally subordinated to the Croatian Ministry of Defence, conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo near Obrovac. Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence and police forces, marking the first such engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. On 26 August, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly attacked Kijevo, expelling all Croats from the village. Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. On 1113 September, an attack in the area of Skradin cut water and power supply to Šibenik.|$|E
