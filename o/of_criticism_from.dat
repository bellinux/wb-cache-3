5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in midterm elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up {{transcendental}} meditation {{and turned his}} attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> fellow scientists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties {{and his government}} duties made him the target <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied {{with the results of}} the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 2015, {{following}} years <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> the fans over {{the design of}} the 1997 badge, the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design. After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed {{in the style of the}} older, circular variants. A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December. The new design was officially unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|The band {{first became}} {{involved}} with Sarajevo in 1993 on their Zoo TV Tour; approached by aid worker Bill Carter about bringing attention to the Siege of Sarajevo, the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with Bosnians during their shows. These link-ups were the subject <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy. Although the war made it impractical for U2 to visit Sarajevo at the time, they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city. After the conflict ended in November 1995, they made arrangements to visit Sarajevo, and with help from United Nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops, they scheduled and played the concert in 1997.|$|E
5|$|There was a storm <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> scientists, {{particularly}} {{those at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Leó Szilárd and Harold Urey were particularly notable critics. The bill created a powerful administrator and deputy administrator, and specifically stated {{that they might be}} members of the armed forces. It was feared that they would dominate the part-time commissioners. The fact that the bill emphasized that the administrator had to keep the deputy fully informed further aroused suspicion that the administrator would be an Army officer and the deputy a Navy officer. The secrecy provisions also frightened many scientists; it contained severe penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 in fines for security breaches. The Chicago Sun headline accused the War Department of attempting to railroad the legislation through Congress.|$|E
5|$|Van Buren {{soon became}} a major target <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> the Whigs {{following}} the Panic of 1837. Seeking to run a non-controversial and less ideological war hero who could defeat Van Buren based on popularity, a unified Whig Party nominated Harrison over party founder Henry Clay and fellow general Winfield Scott. John Tyler of Virginia was selected as his running mate, and Harrison and Tyler defeated Van Buren in the 1840 election. At the time, he was the oldest president ever elected. However, Harrison died of pneumonia in April 1841, a month after taking office. Tyler then assumed the presidency, setting a major precedent.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Batavia in the {{aftermath}} of the engagement, Linois was the subject <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> the Dutch governors for his failure to defeat the China convoy. They also refused his requests to make use of the Dutch squadron stationed in port for future operations. Rejoined by Atalante, Linois sold two captured country ships and resupplied his squadron, before sailing for Isle de France, Marengo arriving on 2 April. During the return journey, Linois had detached his frigates and they captured a number of valuable merchant ships sailing independently before joining the admiral at Port Louis, which Decaen had renamed Port Napoleon. On his arrival, Linois was questioned by Decaen about the engagement with the China Fleet and when Decaen found his answers unsatisfactory the governor wrote a scathing letter to Napoleon, which he despatched to France on Berceau. Linois remained at Isle de France for the next two and a half months, eventually departing with Marengo, Atalante and Sémillante in late June, while Belle Poule was detached to cruise independently.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo {{as an example of}} video games as an art form. Limbo received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> <b>from</b> reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length. The title was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. The title won several awards from industry groups after its release, and was named {{as one of the top}} games for 2010 by several publications. Playdead's next title, Inside, was released in 2016, and revisited many of the same themes presented in Limbo.|$|E
