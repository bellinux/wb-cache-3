40|$|AbstractSolar {{resource}} in northern Chile {{is among the}} highest in the world, and economy pivots around mining industries [1], which have an intensive consumption of heat, electricity and water. Electricity supply is strongly based on coal and the common source for heat is diesel [2]. While PV can provide electricity at a near competitive price in most markets, CSP is seen as more suitable for utility-scale projects, so both technologies are considered for electricity supply. A base case has been defined for each technology, with investment, operation, fiscal and financial costs as close as possible to the reality of the solar sector in Chile. Five different taxes have been detected to apply to Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (ERNC) projects, such as Customs Duty, Value-Added Tax (VAT), Corporate Tax, Municipal Tax and Additional Tax for Expatriated Revenues. The effect of these taxes on the final price of electricity required to make the project economically feasible has been determined. Sensitivity to exemptions and incentives, both existing and proposed, has been studied, and the efficiency of such measures, in terms of price reduction vs. taxes not collected, has been estimated. The Chilean state and/or Multilateral Development Banks can channel aids from Clean Technology Funds or <b>Official</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Assistances</b> to incentive solar projects through different products such as Soft Loans and Partial Credit Guaranties. The effect of these aids on the final price of electricity required to make the project economically feasible has been determined, and sensitivities have been studied...|$|R

40|$|This Policy Contribution {{provides}} up-to-date {{evidence of}} the strong heterogeneity in {{the relationships between the}} five biggest EU economies with the Southern Mediterranean Countries (SMCs). Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia are still strongly tied to France, Italy and Spain, in terms of investments, financial flows and migration. This pattern is in line with the pattern of sizable French and Spanish <b>official</b> bilateral <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. However, the economic connection of Germany, the UK and the US to the western SMCs is negligible. German and US bilateral <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> is focused in Egypt, while the four other SMCs appear not to be priorities for non-Mediterranean EU countries. These differences cannot be explained by geographical distance alone. The unbalanced economic relationship of the SMCs with a small number of European countries risks exposing the SMCs to shocks in partner countries. Stronger economic ties also results in a higher degree of mutual political attention, as exemplified by bilateral <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> that flows more strongly between countries with strong economic links. EU external policy is still largely driven by member states' interests. Hence building economic ties between the SMCs and non-traditional EU partners could both improve the SMCs' external economic relationships, and make the SMCs' political relationship with the EU more resilient...|$|R

40|$|Due to the Reform and Open Door Policies {{initiated}} in 1978, China recorded a fast {{sustainable economic growth}} with an estimated average GDP growth rate of 9. 7 % {{in the period of}} 1980 - 2008, turning China [...] in 2009 - into the world's second largest economy, just after USA. With an export oriented economic model, highly supported by FDI, mostly from developed countries, China is, since 2002, the most attractive developing country for FDI flows, both at short and long terms, becoming not only the world's factory, but also its number one exporter, after surpassing Germany in 2009. With the biggest current account surplus balance, China has been able to achieve a foreign exchange reserve of US$ 2. 2 trillion [...] the world's largest reserve currency. Around 50 % of this huge reserve is being applied in American bonds, while the remaining supports Chinese health and social security systems, Chinese banks' solvability, internationalization of the Chinese economy, investment in geostrategic positioning to guarantee energy independence and making foreign aid available to other developing countries. During 2008 's global crisis, China was able to resist better than the major world economies even benefitting from this downturn to implement policies to reduce its economic imbalances. One of these imbalances is the gap between Chinese FDI and OFDI which is now progressively narrowing. In fact, in the near future, OFDI is expected even be larger than FDI. Mostly two types of Chinese OFDI can be distinguished: trade-oriented investment and resource-seeking investment. Governmental backing, including <b>official</b> <b>developments</b> <b>assistance</b> (ODA) has been crucial for the resource-seeking investment. Although the Chinese investment is nowadays more oriented to mature economies, its bulk is mainly directed to the other developing countries mainly to Latin American countries and now also to African countries. Following the Beijing Consensus, Chinese planners are pushing partnerships with African countries and within those, the Chinese government identified one strategic group worth to cooperate and invest, the Portuguese Speaking African Countries which are linked through a network of language and culture between themselves and also to other geostrategic economic spaces; to Europe via Portugal, to Latin America via Brazil and to Asia via Macau.

CONCLUSION: The allocation of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health on a global scale seems to be related far more to child mortality rather than adult mortality. Countries of CEE-CIS have a high burden of adult morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases, which does not appear to attract proportionate <b>development</b> <b>assistance.</b> Levels of <b>development</b> <b>assistance</b> for health should be determined in consideration of the region's particular burden of disease...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a neo-Gramscian {{examination}} of the causes and processes underlying social restructuring in Bolivia between 1985 and 2005. Restructuring is understood as a worldwide political struggle by an expanding transnational historic bloc of elite social forces to reconfigure the capital-labour relation in order to sustain global capital accumulation. The transnational bloc expanded following the debt crisis of the early 1980 s by incorporating transnationalised businessmen and technocrats beyond its transatlantic heartland. It also generated qualitative changes in the strategic approach of multilateral development institutions, which began to emphasise fiscal and monetary stability, the privatisation of accumulation, public-private partnerships, business class formation in the periphery, state-building and multilateralism. Meanwhile, Bolivia’s hyperinflationary crisis (1985) offered an opportunity for transnationalised elements of banking, mining and commercial fractions of Bolivian capital, to change the balance of forces within the three dominant political parties and vie {{for control of the}} state. This small elite nucleus, integrated into the transnational bloc primarily through <b>official</b> channels of <b>development</b> <b>assistance,</b> struggled against domestically-oriented elite forces and organised labour to restructure economic, ideological and institutional relations in the Bolivian space. These struggles involved the privatisation of accumulation, the attempt to build capital hegemony (i. e. to generate a consensual capitalist order) and the liberalisation of the state.
