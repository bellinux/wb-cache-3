25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, {{nor do we}} prove it a priori. But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from {{the things that have}} been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is part comedy, Cody {{initially}} intended {{for it to be}} a [...] "very dark, very brooding" [...] traditional slasher film. Close to [...] "a third of the way into the process" [...] she felt that she was incapable of doing so because [...] "the humor just kept sneaking in". She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Every {{aspect of}} the film was {{constantly}} analyzed, with storylines, jokes, and characters regularly being rewritten. Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions, The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, {{two months before the}} film was released. James L. Brooks noted, [...] "70 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> —based on where we were eight weeks ago—are no longer in the movie." [...] Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut. Various new characters were created, and then cut because they did not contribute enough. Originally Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church. The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa. The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered. One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized [...] "the audience was not as familiar with [...] long-standing crush on [...] as [...] thought". A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with [...] "more emotional and realistic" [...] scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{explained}} in the novel as follows: [...] "To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief {{in the existence of}} the world around you and the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy – to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon {{the most important thing you}} possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god takes care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the cosmos {{or that he}} does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, {{there would be no}} {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the cosmos.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{philosophers}} divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, {{which is}} experience itself, and access consciousness, {{which is the}} processing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> experience. Phenomenal consciousness {{is the state of}} being conscious, such as when they say [...] "I am conscious." [...] Access consciousness is being conscious of something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says [...] "I am conscious of these words." [...] Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, stream of consciousness, Husserl's phenomenology, and intentionality. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of qualia. Social psychology links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through animal cognition, ethology, evolutionary psychology, and comparative psychology as well. Human ecology is an academic discipline that investigates how humans and human societies interact with both their natural environment and the human social environment.|$|E
