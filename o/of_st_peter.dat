5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Peter</b> was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000.

5|$|Due to its location, the Church <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Peter</b> {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar.

5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Peter</b> Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E
5|$|Between the 13th {{century and}} the {{dissolution}} five monks were sent from Muchelney to the University of Oxford studying at either Canterbury College or Gloucester College.

5|$|In the {{following}} year Yaropolk returned and reportedly came to an agreement with Vladimir Monomakh, but nothing specific is known of the terms other than Yaropolk being reinstated. In 1087, Yaropolk was murdered. The circumstances of his murder are not clear, but the Primary Chronicle suggested the complicity of Riurik Rostislavich, Prince of Peremyshl, and his brother Vasilko Rostislavich, Prince of Terebovl. His murderer was a man called Neradets, who put a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl; the date given is November 22, 1087. His body was taken to Kiev and buried in the church <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Peter,</b> the church which Yaropolk himself had endowed.|$|E
