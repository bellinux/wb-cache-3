40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{document}} the abundant resources {{available for the}} photographic reconstruction of glacier terminus positions in the Canadian High Arctic, with particular reference to Axel Heiberg Island. Early terrestrial photographs may yet be discovered in the archives of explorers, but systematic photography of the High Arctic began with aerial coverage by the U. S. Air Force’s Operation Polaris in the early 1940 s. This oblique (trimetrogon) coverage was completed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the early 1950 s, and the coverage of vertical photography was completed in the late 1950 s. Thereafter the resources become intermittent, but Axel Heiberg Island glaciers have been imaged quite frequently from the air. Visible-band satellite imagery is available from as early as 1962, {{but the number of}} useful archived images is limited by persistent, extensive cloud cover and, for some satellites, by distance of the region from ground receiving stations. Radar imagery, which is free of the cloud constraint, has recently become available both from the air and from space. We illustrate the potential of the photographic record by extending back to 1948 an earlier analysis of the terminus fluctuations of White and Thompson Glaciers. Analysis of an <b>oblique</b> <b>photograph</b> demonstrates a significantly more rapid retreat of White Glacier during 1948 – 60 than during 1960 – 95, while the advance of Thompson Glacier between 1948 and 1960, at 58 m a- 1, was almost three times faster than thereafter.

50|$|The two {{dimensions}} of a radar image are range and cross-range. Radar images of limited patches of terrain can resemble <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs,</b> but not ones {{taken from the}} location of the radar. This is because the range coordinate in a radar image is perpendicular to the vertical-angle coordinate of an oblique photo. The apparent entrance-pupil position (or camera center) for viewing such an image is therefore not as if at the radar, but as if at a point from which the viewer's line of sight is perpendicular to the slant-range direction connecting radar and target, with slant-range increasing from top to bottom of the image.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Distinct {{water level}} rise above tidal level {{has already been}} {{reported}} at several river mouths {{during the period of}} high waves. At Shiribetsu River mouth located in Hokkaido, Japan, a lot of cases of wave set-up are observed every year during the period from October to March, and it is found that the magnitude of water level rise increased with the development of sand spit at the river mouth. In order to find a relationship between wave set-up height and sand spit length at the river entrance, <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs</b> at the Shiribetsu River mouth, taken from a small mountain every two weeks for these twenty years, are effectively utilized in this study...|$|R

The sand spit length is obtained from <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs</b> after interpolation to utilize as one of the input data for artificial neural network. Results indicate that morphology data is useful to predict precise superelevation of the water level in the river mouth. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{two methods}} based on {{computer}} vision {{are presented in}} order to produce dense point clouds and high resolution DEMs (digital elevation models) of the Corral del Veleta rock glacier in Sierra Nevada (Spain). The first one is a semi-automatic 3 D photo-reconstruction method (SA- 3 D-PR) based on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform algorithm and the epipolar geometry theory that uses <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs</b> and camera calibration parameters as input. The second method is fully automatic (FA- 3 D-PR) and is based on the recently released software 123 D-Catch that uses the Structure from Motion and MultiView Stereo algorithms and needs as input <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs</b> and some measurements in order to scale and geo-reference the resulting model. The accuracy of the models was tested using as benchmark a 3 D model registered by means of a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The results indicate that both methods can be applied to micro-scale study of rock glacier morphologies and processes with average distances to the TLS point cloud of 0. 28 m and 0. 21 m, for the SA- 3 D-PR and the FA- 3 D-PR methods, respectively. The performance of the models was also tested by means of the dimensionless relative precision ratio parameter resulting in figures of 1 : 1071 and 1 : 1429 for the SA- 3 D-PR and the FA- 3 D-PR methods, respectively. Finally, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the study area were produced and compared with the TLS-derived DEM. The results showed average absolute differences with the TLS-derived DEM of 0. 52 m and 0. 51 m for the SA- 3 D-PR and the FA- 3 D-PR methods, respectively...|$|R

30|$|An {{additional}} finding {{from this}} study is that <b>oblique</b> <b>photographs</b> of fire behaviour taken from the air could be effectively used for estimating spread rates. Other photographic records are currently being examined for their potential in fire behaviour analyses, and much work could be done to improve the interpretation process. For managers also contemplating the use of such photographs for research purposes, we have noted that near-nadir views produce the greatest positional accuracy, but side profiles of the flaming front (flames visible underneath the smoke column) are superior for identifying fire type and fire behaviour details. Photos should be from a wide angle perspective so that landscape features are visible as much as possible. Higher resolution will permit zooming in to identify landscape features, vegetation, and fire behaviour details. Finally, ensuring proper time settings on digital cameras will help reduce confusion in spread rate calculations.|$|R
