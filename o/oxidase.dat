For example, in E. coli, {{there are two different}} types of ubiquinol <b>oxidase</b> using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an <b>oxidase</b> with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an <b>oxidase</b> that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde <b>oxidase,</b> sulfite <b>oxidase</b> and xanthine <b>oxidase.</b> In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine <b>oxidase,</b> a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine <b>oxidase</b> is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} sequence {{information on}} oxygen reductases of the haem–copper superfamily, {{together with the}} available three-dimensional structures, allows a clear identification of their common, functionally important features. Taking into consideration both the overall amino acid sequences of the core subunits and key residues involved in proton transfer, a novel hypothesis for the molecular evolution of these enzymes is proposed. Three main families of oxygen reductases are identified {{on the basis of}} common features of the core subunits, constituting three lines of evolution: (i) type A (mitochondrial-like <b>oxidases),</b> (ii) type B (ba 3 -like <b>oxidases)</b> and (iii) type C (cbb 3 -type <b>oxidases).</b> The first group can be further divided into two subfamilies, according to the helix VI residues at the hydrophobic end of one of the proton pathways (the so-called D-channel) : (i) type A 1, comprising the enzymes with a glutamate residue in the motif –XGHPEV–, and (ii) type A 2, enzymes having instead a tyrosine and a serine in the alternative motif –YSHPXV–. This second subfamily of <b>oxidases</b> is shown to be ancestor to the one containing the glutamate residue, which in the Bacteria domain is only present in <b>oxidases</b> from Gram-positive or purple bacteria. It is further proposed that the Archaea domain acquired terminal <b>oxidases</b> by gene transfer from the Gram-positive bacteria, implying that these enzymes were not present in the last common ancestor before the divergence between Archaea and Bacteria. In fact, most <b>oxidases</b> from archaea have a higher amino acid sequence identity and similarity with those from bacteria, mainly from the Gram-positive group, than with <b>oxidases</b> from other archaea. Finally, a possible relation between the dihaemic subunit (FixP) of the cbb 3 <b>oxidases</b> and subunit II of caa 3 <b>oxidases</b> is discussed. As the families of haem–copper <b>oxidases</b> can also be identified by their subunit II, a parallel evolution of subunits I and II is suggested...|$|R

Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, is thought {{to play an important role}} in dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) <b>oxidases</b> are multi-subunit enzymatic complexes that generate reactive oxygen species as their primary function. Increased immunoreactivities for the NADPH <b>oxidases</b> catalytic subunits Nox 1, Nox 2 and Nox 4 have been reported in the brain of PD patients.

40|$|Amine <b>oxidases,</b> {{the major}} enzymes of {{biogenic}} amines metabolism, {{are considered to}} be biological regulators, especially for cell growth and differentiation. A primary involvement of amine <b>oxidases</b> in cancer growth inhibition and progression, especially by means of aldehydes, H 2 O 2 and other reactive oxygen species, the amine oxidase-mediated products of biogenic amines oxidation, has been demonstrated. Amine <b>oxidases</b> are involved in cancer growth inhibition because of the higher content in tumour cells of biogenic amines in comparison to normal cells. The cytotoxic effect can be explained by a damage to cell membranes and/or nuclei or, indirectly, through modulation of membrane permeability transition and therefore apoptosis. The oxidation products of biogenic amines appears to be also carcinogenic, while acrolein, produced from the oxidation of spermine and spermidine, should be a key compound both carcinogenic and cytotoxic. The cancer inhibition/promotion effect of amine <b>oxidases</b> could be explained by taking into consideration the full pattern of the enzyme content of the cell. The balance of amine <b>oxidases</b> and antioxidant enzymes appear to be a crucial point for cancer inhibition or progression. A long lasting imbalance of these enzymes appears to be carcinogenic, while, for a short time, amine <b>oxidases</b> are cytotoxic for cancer cells. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Larvae of {{the common}} green {{lacewing}} (GLW), Chrysopa carnea Stephens, have been reported tolerant to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides including permethrin (C/T) (3 -phenoxybenzyl- 3 -(2, 2 -dichlorovinyl) - 2, 2 -dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate), the trans isomer being more toxic than cis. An investigation was performed to determine the possible role of metabolism in this tolerance. Following topical application, GLW metabolized 80 % of cis and 71 % of trans within two hrs. About 95 % of both cis and trans were metabolized by 50 hrs. Metabolism of C/T in vitro was compared to a susceptible insect, the tobacco budworm (TBW), Heliothis virescens (F.). GLW degraded cis 1. 7 -fold faster than trans, while TBW metabolized trans at a slightly higher rate than cis. When esterases and <b>oxidases</b> were active together or alone, cis and trans were metabolized faster by GLW than TBW. Metabolism of C/T by GLW was primarily oxidative with hydrolysis as a secondary mechanism. Trans is more toxic to GLW apparently because of this isomer's lower rate of detoxication. Several metabolites of C/T, cis-, and trans-permethrin were identified in studies with GLW in vivo and in vitro. It appeared that cis was metabolized more intensively than trans in vivo. The roles of esterases and <b>oxidases</b> in metabolizing C/T, cis-, and trans-isomers were studied in vitro and the following number of metabolites were identified: with C/T [...] five with esterases plus <b>oxidases,</b> six with esterases, and seven with <b>oxidases</b> alone.
