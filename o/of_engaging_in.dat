Angel confiscates the stash in the police department's evidence room.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to}} have sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|Romano and Senior {{argue that}} Antara's {{relationship}} with the government puts the agency at risk <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> self-censorship in recent years. Internal reforms immediately after 1998 did not completely eliminate the culture of cronyism {{that had come to}} characterize the relationship {{between the government and the}} press. The two note, however, that Antara journalists were given greater rights to affiliate and organize into unions than their peers in other news organizations.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|In 1578, Elizabeth I {{granted a}} patent to Humphrey Gilbert for {{discovery}} and overseas exploration. That year, Gilbert sailed for the Caribbean {{with the intention}} <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic. In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of Newfoundland whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the Roanoke Colony {{on the coast of}} present-day North Carolina, but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky, accepting the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return to Kentucky was also {{motivated by a}} growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia about the wisdom <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage and her own wavering on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.|$|E
5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless {{they were willing to}} go without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of the}} family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the reputation of the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Haakon also {{attempted}} to strengthen his {{ties with the}} papacy by issuing a vow of crusade. In 1241 he however converted this into a vow <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianized—something that would please the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer down. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E

25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} {{subjective}} experience, {{and the meaning}} created from it, is not an individual event.

Additionally, creating subjective truth and meaning, along with engaging in dialogue, requires two mental faculties: memory and imagination.|$|E
