Tore would be quite pissed <b>off</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just stopped doing anything.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2003, she {{released}} her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: [...] "new-age, pop and trip hop chamber music". Written during her late teenage years, Enchant {{revolved around the}} supernatural realm {{and its effect on}} the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as [...] "fantasy rock", which dealt with [...] "dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite your head <b>off</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> dare to touch them". The faery-themed [...] "Enchant Puzzle" [...] appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. Her bandmates consisted of cellist Joey Harvey, drummer Heath Jansen, guitarist Ben Lehl, and bassist Jimmy Vanaria, who also worked on the electronics. At the same time of Enchants release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, [...] "a classical baroque ensemble" [...] that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks—a woman executed for witchcraft.|$|E

We come for you before, and woe betide you if we come back again. You come to this land alive, but you will leave it as body part." [...] Yasser Arafat's image accompanied the children on stage as they carried toy guns and wore uniforms. A woman's charity sponsored the ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Global Warming Unmasked: The Hidden Agenda", Voris {{claimed that}} [...] "Catholic leaders must {{recognize}} global warming {{for what it}} is. It is a government power grab via population reduction. It is a pseudoscience and hyper-sensationalism. These things {{are being used to}} promote the global warming agenda, just {{as they were in the}} early 20th century eugenics movement... In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] you can either be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have your energy supply limited or even cut <b>off.</b> ...<b>If</b> <b>you</b> think the government interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... think back to the tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps. If that had not happened, sterilization would just be a normal thing. It was so revolting that finally people said, 'this whole theory is wrong.' Government leaders were quite happy to just roll along exercising power without limit over their citizens." ...|$|E
