25|$|We {{know that}} <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> inhabits a {{physical}} body, {{similar to other}} physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E
25|$|Director Cosmatos {{stated that}} he's {{interested}} in social control mechanisms, our own personal, internal controls and how religion affects <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> and society. These philosophical ideas {{are present in}} Beyond the Black Rainbow, a film focused on issues of repression and control of emotions. Cosmatos partly picked up these themes by reading the science fiction works of Beat novelist William S. Burroughs, books by and large dealing with societal control.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} pains as special qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view {{of the self and}} consciousness. <b>Our</b> <b>consciousness,</b> of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.|$|E
50|$|In {{this sense}} {{consciousness}} always entails being self-aware (being for-itself). Since for Sartre consciousness also entails a <b>consciousness</b> of <b>our</b> {{separation from the}} world, and hence freedom, we are also always aware of this. But we can manipulate these two levels of <b>consciousness,</b> so that <b>our</b> reflective <b>consciousness</b> interprets the factual limits of our objective situation as insurmountable, whilst <b>our</b> pre-reflective <b>consciousness</b> remains aware of alternatives.|$|R

50|$|Each {{society has}} a human center {{where we find}} people, their consciousness, personalities, talents and needs. Each society also has an {{institutional}} boundary consisting of social institutions and their role structures. Just as <b>our</b> <b>consciousnesses,</b> needs and desires are shaped by the institutions we create to facilitate our social activities so are our institutions shaped by our cultural traditions. How we define our institutions and the roles we play in society has an important effect {{on what kind of}} people we become.|$|R
25|$|Following Husserl, Sartre views absurdity as {{a quality}} of all {{existing}} objects (and of the material world collectively), independent of any stance humans might take with respect to them. <b>Our</b> <b>consciousness</b> of an object does not inhere in the object itself. Thus in the early portions of the novel, Roquentin, who takes no attitude towards objects and has no stake in them, is totally estranged from the world he experiences. The objects themselves, in their brute existence, have only participation in a meaningless flow of events: they are superfluous. This alienation from objects casts doubt for him, in turn, on his own validity and even his own existence.|$|E
25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into <b>our</b> <b>consciousness,</b> but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in <b>our</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

5000|$|Religion, for Durkheim, is not [...] "imaginary", {{although}} he does deprive it of what many believers find essential. Religion is very real; it {{is an expression of}} society itself, and indeed, there is no society that does not have religion. We perceive as individuals a force greater than ourselves, which is our social life, and give that perception a supernatural face. We then express ourselves religiously in groups, which for Durkheim makes the symbolic power greater. Religion is an expression of <b>our</b> collective <b>consciousness,</b> which is the fusion of all of <b>our</b> individual <b>consciousnesses,</b> which then creates a reality of its own.|$|R

2500|$|The method Easwaran {{suggests}} is simple: pick a mantram of 'proven power' {{recommended by}} the great spiritual teachers of any religion that you follow. Easwaran makes no attempt to avoid references to religion and the aim of his technique is, in fact, to take one closer to God. Claims Easwaran: [...] "Constant repetition and practice {{is required for the}} mantram to take root in <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> and gradually transform it, just as constant repetition makes the advertiser's jingle stick in our minds."...

2500|$|Zen {{emphasizes}} zazen: meditation as {{the means}} to awakening. There are various methods of meditation. In Buddhism two main approaches are used, vipaśyanā (awareness training) and [...] śamatha (concentration of the mind). Zen Buddhism emphasizes samātha. The Japanese word Zen {{is derived from the}} Chinese word 禅, , which is derived from the Sanskrit dhyāna [...] "concentration". The Japanese word zazen means [...] "sitting meditation". However, Zen meditation ideally is not only concentration, but also awareness: being aware of the continuing changes in <b>our</b> <b>consciousness,</b> of all our sensations and our automatic reactions.|$|E

60|$|Most {{dreams are}} stimulated {{from the blood}} into the nerves and the nerve-centers. And the heart is the {{transmission}} station. For the blood has a unity and a consciousness of its own. It has a deeper, elemental consciousness of the mechanical or material world. In the blood we have the body of <b>our</b> most elemental <b>consciousness,</b> <b>our</b> almost material <b>consciousness.</b> And during sleep this material consciousness transfers itself into the nerves and to the brain. The transfer in wakefulness results in a feeling of pain or discomfort--as when we have indigestion, which is pure blood-discomfort. But in sleep the transfer is made through the dream-images which are mechanical phenomena like mirages.|$|R

[...] Hopper's paintings highlight the seemingly mundane and typical scenes in our everyday life and give them cause for epiphany. In this way Hopper's art takes the gritty American landscape and lonely gas stations and creates within them a sense of beautiful anticipation.|$|E
2500|$|Consciousness is {{sometimes}} {{defined as the}} quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been defined somewhat vaguely as: subjectivity, awareness, sentience, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind. Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers {{believe that there is}} a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is. Max Velmans and Susan Schneider wrote in The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness: [...] "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of <b>our</b> <b>consciousness,</b> making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives." ...|$|E

[...] I just don't think we're that stupid to continue {{in a way that}} continues to destroy.

2500|$|So serial {{thinking}} is something that's come into <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{and will be}} there forever: it's relativity and nothing else. It just says: Use all the components of any given number of elements, don't leave out individual elements, use them all with equal importance {{and try to find}} an equidistant scale so that certain steps are no larger than others. It's a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial way. Whenever you look at a certain star sign you find a limited number of elements with different intervals. If we more thoroughly studied the distances and proportions of the stars we'd probably find certain relationships of multiples based on some logarithmic scale or whatever the scale may be.|$|E
2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{other studies}} at the neuronal levels as providing [...] "a reassuring confirmation of previous studies that recorded neural populations" [...] {{such as the one}} just described. Note that these results were gathered using finger movements, and may not necessarily generalize to other actions such as thinking, or even other motor actions in different situations. Indeed, the human act of planning has implications for free will and so this ability must also be explained by any theories of unconscious decision making. Philosopher Alfred Mele also doubts the conclusions of these studies. He explains that simply because a movement may have been initiated before our [...] "conscious self" [...] has become aware of it does not mean <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> does not still get to approve, modify, and perhaps cancel (called vetoing) the action.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that <b>our</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{may not be}} what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it easy to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E
