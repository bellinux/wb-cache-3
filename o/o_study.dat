40|$|Fluconazole {{pharmacokinetics}} {{were evaluated}} for 10 volunteers with AIDS {{who had no}} clinical evidence of gastroenteritis. Single 100 -mg intravenous (i. v.) and oral (p. o.) doses were administered in a randomized, crossover design. i. v. doses were delivered by a constant-rate infusion over 30 min. Serum fluconazole concentrations were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. The i. v. and p. <b>o.</b> <b>studies</b> were modelled simultaneously by iterative two-stage analysis, which provided individual parameter estimates and a population pharmacokinetic model. Median areas under the concentration-time curves for i. v. and p. <b>o.</b> <b>studies</b> did not differ (90. 6 and 99. 3 micrograms/ml. h, respectively). Consistent with this finding, the median fractional bioavailability was 1. 1 (range, 0. 45 to 1. 3), comparable to those in healthy subjects. Serum pharmacokinetics in these AIDS patients were generally similar to published data for healthy volunteers. However, following p. o. dosing, we observed a slightly delayed and highly variable time to maximum concentration in serum (median, 2 h; range, 15 min to 8 h). Data were well described by a linear, two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and elimination. Repeated-measures analysis of variance found no significant differences among any of the pharmacokinetic parameters between i. v. and p. <b>o.</b> <b>studies.</b> On {{the basis of our}} findings, we suggest no change in dosage of p. o. fluconazole in patients with AIDS who show no clinical signs of enteropathy...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} f the base exchange capacity of small samples of clay minerals {{has been described}} by H. van Olphen (1950, 1951). The method is based on the exchange of the exchange-able cations against large organic cations; for the latter, cetyltri-methyl ammonium bromide (lissolamine) was used. The point of complete xchange can be detected by an emulsification test: at the point of equivalence the clay becomes an excellent emulsifier for oil-water systems; {{this is supposed to be}} due to its being at one and the same time oleophilic at the surface and hydrophilic at the edges of the particles.

40|$|The {{transfer}} function is used t <b>o</b> <b>study</b> solute transport in complex soil systems {{in a simple}} way by characterizing the output flux {{as a function of}} the input flux. The stochastic convective model of the {{transfer function}} assumes that solute travel time spreads out at a rate proportional to the square of the distance from the inlet end. Data from a laboratory experiment conducted through long soil columns are used to validate the intrinsic assumptions of the stochastic convective model. Analyses of the experimental data in the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil columns support the assumptions of the transfer function. It is shown that the mean of the probability density function of the travel t ime is a linear function of log of the travel distance, while the standard deviation is a constant. The stochastic convective model predicts reasonably accurate results of solute transport in the homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Because of the spatial variability of soils, using information obtained at a location closer t o the predicting place provides better predictions than using information at farther locations...|$|E
