40|$|Recently, a {{new group}} of {{nanostructures}} called "silicone nanofilaments (SNs) " were prepared via polymerization of <b>organosilanes</b> with small alkyl groups. <b>Organosilanes</b> with long alkyl groups tend to form self-assembled monolayers and cannot form SNs because. of their bulky steric hindrance. Here we report the one-step self-assembly of <b>organosilanes</b> with long alkyl groups into SN coatings at room temperature by using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) or tetrachlorosilane (TCS) as the molecular spacer. The SNs should grow according to a "limiting growth" mechanism via a "seeding-asymmetric growth-further growth" process. The growth of SNs could be controlled simply by the composition of the precursor and the water concentration (C-water) in toluene. All the precursors studied can form SNs successfully under proper conditions, indicating universality of this method. The wettability of the SN coatings ranges from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic and even to superamphiphobic. Moreover, these coatings are transparent and can be easily applied onto various substrates besides the glass slide. This facile fabrication of SNs using <b>organosilanes</b> with tong alkyl groups will shed light on their application in generating unique nanostructures besides self-assembled monolayers...|$|R

50|$|Hydrosilanes are not {{intrinsically}} nucleophilic; thus, {{they react}} only with highly electrophilic functional {{groups that have}} carbocationic character. However, many resonance-stabilized carbocations are insufficiently electrophilic to react with hydrosilanes. Upon the generation of a carbocation, rate-determining hydride transfer from the <b>organosilane</b> occurs to yield a reduced product and a neutral silane in which the counterion of the carbocation has replaced hydrogen.

First, {{the surface of}} MSNs was prehydrated with two monolayers worth of water, followed by treatment with one monolayer worth of <b>organosilanes</b> (based on the available surface area). The <b>organosilanes</b> (vinyl-trichlorsilan, propyl-trichlorsilan, isobutyl-trichlorsilan, and phenyl-trichlorsilan) then underwent hydrolysis and became covalently attached to the substrate and cross-linked to one another, generating SAM-MSNs with different organic groups (denoted Vi-SAM-MSNs, Pr-SAM-MSNs, Is-SAM-MSNs, and Ph-SAM-MSNs, respectively).|$|R
50|$|The Hiyama {{coupling}} {{is limited}} by the need for fluoride in order to activate the organosilicon reagent. Addition of fluoride cleaves any silicon protecting groups (e.g. silyl ethers), which are frequently employed in organic synthesis. The fluoride ion is also basic, so base sensitive protecting groups, acidic protons, and functional groups may be affected by the addition of this activator. Most of the active research concerning this reaction involves circumventing this problem. To overcome this issue, many groups have looked to the use of other basic additives for activation, or use of a different <b>organosilane</b> reagent all together, leading to the multiple variations of the original Hiyama coupling.|$|E

50|$|Examination of this reaction's {{mechanism}} {{suggests that}} {{the formation of the}} silonate is all that is needed to activate addition of the <b>organosilane</b> to the palladium center. The presence of a pentavalent silicon is not needed and kinetic analysis has shown that this reaction has first order dependence on silonate concentration. This is due to the key bond being formed, the Pd-O bond during the transmetalation step, that then allows for transfer of the carbon fragment onto the palladium center. Based on this observation, it seems that the rate limiting step in this catalytic cycle is the Pd-O bond formation, in which increased silonate concentrations increase the rate of this reaction (indicative of faster reactions).|$|E

Beyond the optimized ratio between the two <b>organosilanes,</b> we have discovered that the thickness rather than the pore size dictates the resulting superhydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed that silianization does not damage the cellulose microfibers; instead they are coated with uniform, particulate nanostructures, which should contribute to the observed surface properties.

50|$|Organosilanes are organic {{derivatives}} of silane containing {{at least}} one carbon to silane bond. Dehydrocoupling of <b>organosilane</b> is an efficient method to produce polysilanes. One {{of the most successful}} routes to polymerize phenylsilane is via through group 4 metallocene derivatives. However, they provide polymers with low molecular weight. Nevertheless, the catalytic route allows the possibility to control the polymer stereochemistry as well as introducing new functionality to the group. Polysilanes are an interesting class of radiation sensitive material. They absorb and illuminate under ultraviolet light. This is attributed to the low lying σ- σ * transitions from delocalized electronic states of conjugated silicone atoms of the polymer. The substituent and molecular weight of the polymer influences the electronic properties of polysilane.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other two}} {{synthesis}} methods used for these materials are post-synthetic grafting and co-condensation. [...] In {{the case of}} post-synthetic grafting, organic functional groups, typically organosilanes or alkoxyorganosilanes, are reacted with the assembled silicon mesostructure {{with or without the}} surfactant template present. If the template is still present, the grafting process will involve simultaneously removing the template and attaching the functional group. However, the pores of the material can be blocked during this process so a one-pot synthesis using the necessary components is more advantageous. This one-pot synthesis is known as co-condensation, in which the desired organosilyl functional groups are combined with the surfactant or other structure-directing agent. In this method, the material becomes structured and functionalized. Co-condensation gives rise to periodicity with the mesostructure, and it accommodates larger organic groups as well as larger pore sizes because of the one-step assembly process. Most PMOs have been made using the co-condensation method. The most recent method developed builds on co-condensation by combining multiple reactive organic precursors to form a new functional group, which is still combined with the framework molecule and copolymer. [...] Mesoporous organosilicate materials have been made using bridged organic precursors, in which an organic fragment is positioned between silicon-containing fragments. Single precursor syntheses are typically done with bridged <b>organosilane</b> groups. When only one bridged organic precursor is used, there is a homogeneous distribution of the molecule in the framework. This phenomenon is referred to as molecular-scale periodicity. Chiral precursors can also be introduced into the material framework, and using acidic conditions in the hydrolysis and condensation process proves better for chiral precursors because no racemization occurs. Co-condensation of multiple <b>organosilane</b> precursors can create multi-functional organosilica materials. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) is a common silicon precursor used in co-condensation reactions.|$|E
5000|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) are an {{extremely}} versatile approach {{that allows for}} precise control of surface characteristics.

Self-assembly of monolayers can be achieved using several systems. The basis for self-assembly is the formation of a covalent bond between the surface and the molecule forming the layer; and this requirement can be fulfilled using a variety of chemical groups such as organosilanes at hydroxylated materials (glass, silicon, aluminium oxide, mica) and organosulfur-based compounds species at noble metals [...] While the latter system has been well-characterized, much less is known about the behavior of <b>organosilane</b> layers on surfaces and the underlying mechanisms that control monolayer organization and structure.|$|E

30|$|Periodic {{mesoporous}} organosilicas (PMOs) {{have emerged}} as a diverse class of materials [1 – 4].

Additionally, <b>organosilanes</b> are rarely toxic and their reactions can be easily tracked by NMR spectroscopy (because of distinctive changes in the position of resonance of the methyl groups attached to silicon as addition occurs). Reactions of allylsilanes are similar in many respects to reactions of silyl enol ethers—in fact, allylsilanes can be used as masked enolate equivalents. After addition of the allylsilane, ozonolysis provides the corresponding carbonyl compound.(17) ...|$|R
50|$|Tertiary silanes {{may also}} be dehydrogenatively coupled to {{aromatic}} rings {{with the use of}} the catalyst TpMe2Pt(Me)2H (TpMe2 = hydrido tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate). For example, this platinum catalyst can be used to react triethyl silane with benzene to produce phenyltriethylsilane, with the elimination of hydrogen gas. This is a terrific catalyst because it eliminates the need for a hydrogen acceptor, something which is normally required for the silation of a C-H bond. This reaction {{may also be}} done intramolecularly to produce five- or six-membered silicon-containing rings fused to a phenyl ring. In addition, tributylsilane can be converted into the corresponding cyclic <b>organosilane</b> via the same process. A drawback to this catalyst, however, is that it requires rather harsh reaction conditions (typically 200 °C for 24 hours for the intermolecular reaction, 48 - 72 hours for the intramolecular ones). It is also not particularly regioselective, so starting materials containing substituted benzene would result in a mixture of products.|$|E
50|$|Nickel {{catalyst}} {{reactions are}} few {{to come around}} with, and often come along with limitations. However, nickel catalysts are {{a great source of}} interest due to the cheap cost of nickel compared to other rare transition metals. Recently, (dippe)Ni(µ-H)2 nickel catalyst was found to dehydrogenative couple silane. The rate and extent of the polymerization of silane decreases as it proceeds from primary to secondary silane. The steric hindrance of secondary silane cause the polymerization to require a higher activation energy for silicon coupling at the metal center as the chain length increases. The dehydogenative coupling of <b>organosilane</b> catalyzed by (dippe)Ni(µ-H)2 can proceed through either ơ-bond metathesis or H2 extrusion followed by oxidation reaction. In an attempt to distinguish both mechanisms, the reaction of triethylsilane-d1 and (dippe)Ni(µ-H)2 was observed. A dehydrogenative coupling reaction of triethylsilane would not be catalyzed by the nickel. It would theoretically produce either H2 or HD gas via extrusion to support one mechanism. However, of Et3SiD and nickel hydrides was found and provide proof to support ơ-bond metathesis, but lack of dehydrogenative product of the silane does not allow either mechanism to be ruled out.|$|E
5000|$|The Hiyama {{coupling}} {{was developed}} to combat the issues associated with other organometallic reagents. The initial reactivity of organosilicon was not actually first reported by Hiyama, as Kumada reported a coupling reaction using organofluorosilicates shown below. Organosilanes were then discovered, by Hiyama, to have reactivity when activated by a fluoride source. This reactivity, when combined with a palladium salt, creates a carbon-carbon bond with an electrophillic carbon, like an organic halide. Compared to the inherent issues of well-used organometalics reagents, such as organomagnesium (Grignard Reagents) and organocopper reagents, which are very reactive and {{are known to have}} low chemoselectivity, enough to destroy functional groups on both coupling partners, organosilicon compounds are inactive. Other organometallic reagents using metals such as zinc, tin, and boron, reduce the reactivity issue, but have other problems associated with each reagent. Organozinc reagents are moisture sensitive, organotin compounds are toxic, and organoboron reagents are not readily available, are expensive, and aren't often stable. Organosilanes are readily available compounds that, upon activation (much like organotin or organoboron compounds) from fluoride or a base, can react with organohalides to form C-C bonds in a chemo- and regioselective manner. The reaction first reported was used to couple easily made (and activated) organosilicon nucleophiles and organohalides (electrophiles) {{in the presence of a}} palladium catalyst. Since this discovery, work has been done by various groups to expand the scope of this reaction and to [...] "fix" [...] the issues with this first coupling, such as the need for fluoride activation of the <b>organosilane.</b>|$|E
