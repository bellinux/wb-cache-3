This study analyzes the factors that determine small-scale fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> on Oman 2 ̆ 7 s Batinah Coast, which has almost 30 percent of Oman 2 ̆ 7 s population and {{more than one-third of the}} small-scale fishermen. We find that fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> here can be explained broadly under four major blocks of variables: geographical region, fishing inputs and catch, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and the nature of the relationship with fisheries extension services. In general, the Wilayat (local administrative units) failed to make any significant impact on fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income.</b> The variable "Fishing inputs and catch," such as increases in engine power, boat length, weekly catch, and number of weekly trips, positively impacted fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> while increases in weekly fishing costs, number of crew members, and difficulty in getting ice had a significantly negative effect on the in come. Furthermore, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics also contributed significantly in determining the fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> level. The other important findings were related to extension services. The variables "Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s exchange of information and cooperation with the ministry" and "Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the extension activities" were found to have positive effects on fishermen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>income</b> levels.

40|$|Based on Becker’s (1965) {{insight that}} {{consumption}} is costly {{in terms of}} both time and money, this paper extends the existing literature by assuming that the consumption of quantities is relatively time-intensive, while the consumption of qualities is relatively money-intensive. The analysis implies that the quantity of children is positively correlated with income only when incomes are relatively low. When people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incomes</b> increase to a certain threshold level, fertility rate will decrease and will ultimately approach to a certain stable level as incomes rise. On the other hand, the analysis implies that the quality of children is not strongly correlated with income with incomes are low. However, when people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incomes</b> reach a certain threshold level, further income increases will mainly lead to the increases of quality, rather than quantity, of children. Thus, this paper provides a unified. theory that simultaneously explains why fertility is positively correlated with income when people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incomes</b> are relatively low and why only the quality, but not the quantity, of children is positively correlated with income when people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>incomes</b> are relatively high...|$|R

Specifically, we test for valuation differences in the boom and crash relative to the more stable 1980 s.
