40|$|We study {{experimentally}} how wettability impacts fluid-fluid-displacement {{patterns in}} granular media. We inject a low-viscosity fluid (air) into a thin bed of glass beads initially saturated with a more-viscous fluid (a water-glycerol mixture). Chemical treatment of glass surfaces {{allows us to}} control the wetting properties of the medium and modify the contact angle θ from 5 ° (drainage) to 120 ° (imbibition). We demonstrate that wettability exerts a powerful influence on the invasion morphology of unfavorable mobility displacements: increasing θ stabilizes fluid invasion into the granular pack at all capillary numbers. In particular, we report the striking observation of a stable radial displacement at low capillary numbers, whose <b>origin</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> the cooperative nature of fluid invasion at the pore scale.

40|$|A single-sensor self-localization {{system which}} uses a monocular camera {{and a set of}} {{artificial}} landmarks is presented herein. The system represents the surrounding environment as a topological map (or graph) where each node corresponds to a marker (i. e., artificial landmark) and each edge corresponds to the existence of a relative pose between two markers. The edges are weighted based on an error metric (related to pose uncertainty) and a shortest path algorithm is applied to the map to compute the path corresponding to the least aggregate error. This path is used to localize the camera with respect to a global coordinate system whose <b>origin</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> an arbitrary reference marker (i. e., the destination node of the path).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the existence and}} implementation of the infinite horizon controller for the case of active steady-state constraints. The case of active steady-state constraints is important because, in many practical applications, controllers are required to operate at the boundary of the feasible region (for instance, in order to maximize global economic objectives). For this case, the usual finite horizon parameterizations with terminal cost cannot be applied since the <b>origin</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> the boundary of the feasible region, and only suboptimal solutions are available. We propose here an iterative algorithm that generates an upper bound and a lower bound finite horizon approximation to the optimal solution. We show convergence of these boundary approximations to the optimal solution as the horizon increases is shown. The difference between the upper and lower bound solutions is used to bound the difference between the approximating solution and the optimal one. The algorithm provides a solution that is guaranteed to be within a user specified tolerance of the optimal solution. A numerical example with comparison between optimal and suboptimal controllers is presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{employs the}} Input-to-State Stability (ISS) {{framework}} {{to investigate the}} robustness of discrete-time Piece-Wise Affine (PWA) systems in closed-loop with Model Predictive Controllers (MPC), or hybrid MPC for short. We show via an example taken from literature that stabilizing hybrid MPC can generate MPC values functions that are not ISS Lyapunov functions for arbitrarily small additive disturbances. As a consequence, {{it is not easy}} to prove that nominally stabilizing hybrid MPC schemes are robust. This motivates the need to design MPC schemes for hybrid systems with an a priori robust stability guarantee. A possible solution to this problem was recently developed by the authors for a particular class of PWA systems, i. e. when the <b>origin</b> <b>lies</b> in the interior of one of the regions in the partition. The main contribution of this paper is a novel dual-mode MPC algorithm for hybrid systems with an a priori ISS guarantee.

40|$|In [40], it {{was shown}} that the {{following}} singularly perturbed Dirichlet problem^ 2 Δ u - u+ |u|^p- 1 u= 0, in, u= 0 on ∂ has a nodal solution u_ which has the least energy among all nodal solutions. Moreover, it is shown that u_ has exactly one local maximum point P_ 1 ^ with a positive value and one local minimum point P_ 2 ^ with a negative value and, as → 0,φ (P_ 1 ^, P_ 2 ^) →_ (P_ 1, P_ 2) ∈×φ (P_ 1, P_ 2), where φ (P_ 1, P_ 2) = (|P_ 1 -P_ 2 / 2, d(P_ 1, ∂), d(P_ 2, ∂)). The following question naturally arises: where is the nodal surface{ u_ (x) = 0 }? In this paper, we give an answer {{in the case of}} the unit ball =B_ 1 (0). In particular, we show that for ϵ sufficiently small, P_ 1 ^, P_ 2 ^ and the <b>origin</b> must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> a line. Without loss of generality, we may assume that this line is the x_ 1 -axis. Then u_ must be even in x_j, j= 2, [...] ., N, and odd in x_ 1. As a consequence, we show that { u_ (x) = 0 } = { x ∈ B_ 1 (0) | x_ 1 = 0 }. Our proof is divided into two steps: first, by using the method of moving planes, we show that P_ 1 ^, P_ 2 ^ and the <b>origin</b> must <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> the x_ 1 -axis and u_ must be even in x_j, j= 2, [...] ., N. Then, using the Liapunov-Schmidt reduction method, we prove the uniqueness of u_ (which implies the odd symmetry of u_ in x_ 1). Similar results are also proved for the problem with Neumann boundary conditions...|$|R

50|$|There is {{a strong}} {{possibility}} that this feature is actually of natural <b>origin.</b> It <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> the down slope side of a substantial hill it could well be a 'slot' canyon cut by rainwater run-off in prehistoric times. Comparing it to other 'slot' canyons, {{especially those in the}} state of Utah (USA), it shows many similar characteristics. The narrowness of the top opening and widening of the lower part are also common to slot caverns elsewhere, as is its serpentine shape. The highly polished sides also suggest that the phenomenon was created by water. Such a natural feature, especially given its acoustics, would have been valued in the ancient world for its supposed sacred properties and this could have led to its preservation. Had it been man-made, why would the 'quarriers' bother to polish its walls to such a high degree, or remove stone in such an impractical fashion? Given that the building of the extensive necropolis that abuts it on the hillside above involved removing a huge amount of the original overlaying rock, {{it is also possible that}} this 'canyon' extended even further before men began quarrying there.|$|R
