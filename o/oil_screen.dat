5000|$|Particles {{in the oil}} {{can also}} cause serious {{problems}} with oil pressure. After oil flows through the engine, it returns to the oil pan, and can carry along a lot of debris. The debris can cause problems with the <b>oil</b> pickup <b>screen</b> and the <b>oil</b> pump itself. The holes in the <b>oil</b> pickup <b>screen</b> measure about 0.04 sq in. [...] Holes of this size only pick up bigger pieces of debris and allow a lot of smaller pieces to flow through it. The holes in the screen are so big (relative to debris) because at low temperatures and slow engine speed the oil is very viscous and needs large openings to flow freely. Even with these large holes in the screen, it can still become clogged and cause low oil pressure. A [...]005 in coating on the screen can reduce hole size to about [...]03 sq in, which in turn reduces the flow of oil by 44 percent.|$|R

40|$|Aims To {{develop a}} novel green {{microencapsulation}} process for textile antimicrobial coating {{for the treatment}} of medical and sports related skin conditions and malodour, which will: •	incorporate eco-friendly microcapsule wall materials (biodegradable polymers). •	provide controlled release of the core material (essential oils). •	exclude toxic substances. Methods and results The essential oils (EOs), Litsea, Lemon, Rosewood, Rosemary, Bergamot, Citronella, Sweet Orange, Bitter Orange, Peppermint and Thyme <b>oil</b> were <b>screened</b> by the disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most effective oil was Litsea oil, with an average zone of inhibition (ZoI) of 4. 7 cm, 2. 0 cm, 5. 3 cm and 4. 3 cm against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. epidermidis respectively. Lemon and Rosemary were the only other EOs which were found to be effective against P. aeruginosa with mean ZoI’s of 2. 1 cm and 2. 4 cm respectively, as well as inhibiting the other 3 bacteria. S. aureus was the most susceptible organism being inhibited by all EOs; P. aeruginosa in turn was the most resistant to the EOs. Conclusions Litsea, Lemon and Rosemary EOs were the most inhibitory <b>oils</b> <b>screened,</b> therefore, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) for these EOs will be determined and they will also be screened against the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum. Significance of study Increased awareness of the textiles industries’ impact on the environment, creates a need for new green processes using eco-friendly materials. The use of EOs as the core material of microcapsules in textile coatings, could lead to an effective textile coating which is not only green but also functional in the treatment of medical or sports related skin conditions.

40|$|Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae are two {{mosquito}} {{species that}} represent significant threats to global public health as vectors of Dengue virus and malaria parasites, respectively. Although mosquito populations have been effectively controlled {{through the use}} of synthetic insecticides, the emergence of widespread insecticide-resistance in wild mosquito populations is a strong motivation to explore new insecticidal chemistries. For these studies, Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae were treated with commercially available plant essential oils via topical application. The relative toxicity of each essential oil was determined, as measured by the 24 -h LD 50 and percentage knockdown at 1 [*]h, as compared with a variety of synthetic pyrethroids. For Ae. aegypti, the most toxic essential oil (patchouli oil) was ∼ 1, 700 -times less toxic than the least toxic synthetic pyrethroid, bifenthrin. For An. gambiae, the most toxic essential oil (patchouli oil) was ∼ 685 -times less toxic than the least toxic synthetic pyrethroid.

40|$|Understanding and {{predicting}} the lubricant degradation of in-service industrial lubricants {{is an important}} and vital part for every lubricant condition-monitoring program. Condition monitoring programs driven by end-users have in many cases ignored the tools/tests to monitor the degradation of the fluid by oxidation by not just {{the cost of the}} available tests but in many cases the lack of knowledge in the area of fluid oxidation. Although the process of oxidation represents a lot of unanswered questions, it starts by understanding the role/function of antioxidants, for different lubricants and conditions, and how they contribute to the oxidative health of lubricants. With the extension of lubricants life, increasing load factors, and introduction of long-life improved base-stocks, it is of extreme high value to know not only your basic condition monitoring tests but also the measure of the remaining oxidative life of lubricants.

Four formulations, where OA was fixed at the concentration of 20  mg/g, were prepared utilizing Sefsol 218 as oil phase, Cremophor EL and Labrasol as primary surfactants, and Transcutol P as cosurfactant. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify self-emulsification regions for the rational design of SNEDDS formulations. Sefsol 218 was found to provide the highest solubility among all medium-chained <b>oils</b> <b>screened.</b> Efficient self-emulsification was observed for the systems composing of Cremophor EL and Labrasol. The surfactant to cosurfactant ratio greatly affected the droplet size of the nanoemulsion.
