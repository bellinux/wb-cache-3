50|$|Many urine tests (urinalysis) {{monitor the}} amount of urobilin in urine, as its levels can give insight on the {{effectiveness}} of urinary tract function. Normally, urine would appear as either light yellow urine or colorless. A lack of water intake, for example following sleep or dehydration, reduces the water content of urine, thereby concentrating urobilin and producing a darker color of urine. <b>Obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> reduces biliary bilirubin excretion, which is then excreted directly from the blood stream into the urine, giving a dark-colored urine but with a paradoxically low urobilin concentration, no urobilinogen, and usually with correspondingly pale faeces. Darker urine also results due to other chemicals, such as various ingested dietary components or drugs, porphyrins in porphyria, and homogentisate in patients with alcaptonuria.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his second}} exile, Mohammad Reza {{travelled}} {{from country to}} country seeking what he hoped would be temporary residence. First he flew to Aswan, Egypt, where he received a warm and gracious welcome from President Anwar El-Sadat. He later lived in Marrakesh, Morocco as a guest of King Hassan II. Mohammad Reza loved to support royalty during his time as Shah and one of those who benefitted had been Hassan, who received an interest-free loan of $110 million US dollars from his friend Mohammad Reza. Mohammad Reza expected Hassan to return the favor, but he soon learned Hassan had other motives. Richard Parker, the American ambassador to Morocco reported [...] "The Moroccans believed the Shah was worth about $2 billion dollars, and they wanted to take their share of the loot". After leaving Morocco, Mohammad Reza lived in Paradise Island, in the Bahamas, and in Cuernavaca, Mexico, near Mexico City, as a guest of José López Portillo. Richard Nixon, the former president, visited the Shah in summer 1979 in Mexico. An American doctor, Dr. Benjamin Kean who examined Mohammad Reza in Cuernavaca later wrote:"There was no longer any doubt. The atmosphere had changed completely. The Shah's appearance was stunningly worse ... Clearly he had <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> The odds favored gallstones, since his fever, chills and abdominal distress suggested an infection of the biliary tract. Also he had a history of indigestion. Besides the probable obstruction-he now had been deeply jaundiced for six to eight weeks-he was emaciated and suffering from hard tumor nodes in the neck and a swollen spleen, signs that his cancer was worsening, and he had severe anemia and very low white blood counts". The Shah suffered from gallstones that would require prompt surgery. He was offered treatment in Switzerland, but insisted on treatment in the United States. President Carter did not wish to admit Mohammad Reza to the United States, but came under pressure from many quarters with Dr. Kissinger phoning Carter to say he would not endorse the SALT II treaty that Carter had just signed with the Soviet Union unless the former Shah was allowed into the United States, promoting him more than once to hang his phone in rage in the Oval Office and shout [...] "Fuck the Shah!". As many Republicans were attacking the SALT II treaty as an American give-away to the Soviet Union, Carter was anxious to have the endorsement of a Republican elder statesmen like Dr. Kissinger to fend off this criticism. Mohammad Reza had decided not to tell his Mexican doctors he had cancer, and the Mexican doctors had misdiagnosed his illness as malaria, giving him a regime of anti-malarial drugs that did nothing to treat his cancer, which caused his health to go into rapid decline as he lost 30 pounds. In September 1979, a doctor sent by David Rockefeller reported to the State Department Mohammad Reza needed to come to the United States for medical treatment, an assessment not shared by Dr. Kean who stated that the proper medical equipment for treating Mohammad Reza's cancer could be found in Mexico and the only problem was the former Shah's unwillingness to tell the Mexicans he had cancer. The State Department warned not to admit the former Shah into the US, saying it was likely that the Iranian regime would seize the American embassy in Tehran if that occurred. Milani suggested there was a possible conflict of interest on the part of Rockefeller, noting the Chase Manhattan bank had given Iran a $500 million loan under questionable conditions in 1978 (several lawyers refused to endorse the loan) which placed the money in an account with Chase Manhattan, that the new Islamic republic had making [...] "substantial withdrawals" [...] from its account with Chase Manhattan, and that Rockefeller wanted Mohammad Reza in the US, knowing full well it was likely to cause the Iranians to storm the US embassy, which in turn would cause the US government to freeze Iranian financial assets in America, such as the Iranian account at Chase Manhattan.|$|E

40|$|Background: Anesthetics are {{variable}} {{in patients with}} <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> The minimum alveolar concentration awake of desflurane is reduced in patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice,</b> while it {{has no effect on}} pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of propofol. In this study, we investigated the influence of <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> on the pharmacodynamics and blood concentration of rocuronium. Methods: Included in this study were 26 control patients and 27 patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Neuromuscular block of rocuronium was monitored by acceleromyography. Onset time, spontaneous recovery of the height of twitch first (T 1) to 25 % of the final T 1 value (Duration 25 %, Dur 25 %), recovery index (RI), and spontaneous recovery of train-of-four (TOF) ratios to 70 % were measured.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} whether the serum markers of cardiac function determined in a rabbit model with experimentally induced <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> {{are similar to}} those in human patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> MethodsReversible <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> was induced in rabbits by gripping the general bile ducts with a 15 cm hemostasis pincer for 3 min. Sham-operated rabbits were used as controls. Serum samples were taken at day 30 post-surgery. Thirty patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> due to biliary stones, and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited for study. Fasting serum samples were collected for analysis. Changes in serum cardiac markers were assayed by the Beckman-Coulter CX- 7 automatic biochemical analyzer and 81600 N immunoassay system. Significance of differences between groups was assessed by Dunnett’s t-test. ResultsIn the rabbit model, total bilirubin (TBil) and direct bilirubin (DBil) were significantly elevated (vs. sham-operated control, P＜ 0. 01). In addition, the jaundice model showed significantly increased serum creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB; 8. 76 ± 2. 36 vs. 2. 36 ± 1. 12 μg/L), myoglobin (MYO; 88. 4 ± 24. 9 vs. 31. 3 ± 12. 4 μg/L), and cardiac troponin-I (TROPI; 0. 35 ± 0. 11 vs. 0. 01 ± 0. 01 μg/L) (all P＜ 0. 01). Similarly, the patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> showed significantly higher levels of CK-MB (23. 93 ± 5. 11 vs. 2. 06 ± 0. 82 μg/L), MYO (188. 8 ± 36. 5 vs. 25. 4 ± 10. 2 μg/L), and TROPI (0. 34 ± 0. 08 vs. 0. 01 ± 0. 01 μg/L) (all P＜ 0. 01).

40|$|Surgical {{management}} in <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> still contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. One of complications following surgery in <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> is sepsis. This complication {{is caused by}} the toxic effects of bilirubin and bile salts, endotoxins, bacterial translocation, modulation of the immune-inflammatory cascade, decreased cellular immunity and/or nutritional status. Many studies have shown the elevated inflammatory response indicator, interleukin- 1 (IL- 1 b), in patients with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> However, only a few report described the association between the indicators of <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> (alkaline phosphatase [ALP], g-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and bilirubin) and the indicator of inflammatory response (interleukin- 1 b [IL- 1 b]). This study aimed to investigate the association between the indicator of <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> (ALP, GGT, and bilirubin) and the level of interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) in dogs as the animal model. We performed ligation on distal common bile ducts (CBD) to produce a model of <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Every three days within a month, the blood samples from ten dogs were extracted to determine the ALP, GGT, direct and total bilirubin, and IL- 1 b levels. We found a significant correlation between the ALP and GGT with IL- 1 b level with p-value of 0. 036 (r= 0. 626) and 0. 003 (r= 0. 826). However, there was no association between the increased direct bilirubin with the IL- 1 b level (p= 0. 068; r= 0. 537). Moreover, the increased level of ALP and GGT had a strong correlation with the increased level of direct bilirubin with p-value of 0. 004 (r= 0. 810) and p= 0. 011 (r= 0. 746). In conclusion, the increased level of GGT was the strongest indicator for inflammatory response in dogs with <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Furthermore, the increased levels of GGT and ALP might imply the development of <b>obstructive</b> <b>jaundice</b> in dogs...|$|E
