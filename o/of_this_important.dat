5|$|Bernoulli {{wrote the}} text between 1684 and 1689, {{including}} {{the work of}} mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens, Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat, and Blaise Pascal. He incorporated fundamental combinatorial topics such as his theory of permutations and combinations (the aforementioned problems from the twelvefold way) {{as well as those}} more distantly connected to the burgeoning subject: the derivation and properties of the eponymous Bernoulli numbers, for instance. Core topics from probability, such as expected value, were also a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E
5|$|The Romans, however, {{managed to}} stop further Islamic {{expansion}} into their lands during the 8th century and, {{beginning in the}} 9th century, reclaimed parts of the conquered lands. In 1000AD, the Eastern Empire was at its height: Basil II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, culture and trade flourished. However, soon after, the expansion was abruptly stopped in 1071 with the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert. The aftermath <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> battle sent the empire into a protracted period of decline. Two decades of internal strife and Turkic invasions ultimately {{paved the way for}} Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to send a call for help to the Western European kingdoms in 1095.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> distinction.|$|E

For example, the Athenian Parthenon, first reconsecrated as a church was turned into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest and remained structurally unharmed until the 17th century AD. Only the unfortunate impact of a Venetian cannonball into the building, then used to store gunpowder, led to the destruction of much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> temple, more than 2,000 years after it was built.|$|E

When Van Dorn took command of the department, he had to react with his roughly 17,000 man, 60 gun Army of the West to events already underway. Van Dorn wanted to attack and destroy the Union forces, make his way into Missouri, and capture St. Louis, turning over control <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> state to the Confederacy. He met his now-concentrated force near Boston Mountains on March 3, and the army began moving north the next day.|$|E
25|$|A {{master set}} of over 200 {{lithographs}} by American realist painter George Wesley Bellows (1882–1925) {{is one of}} the highlights of the ACMAA’s works on paper collection. Leading American printmakers Martin Lewis (1881–1962), Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Reginald Marsh (1898-1954) are each represented by multiple examples of their graphic work. Also housed in the collection are early works by Edward Hopper (1882–1967) and a complete set of prints by modernist Stuart Davis (1892–1964).

25|$|A turnpike {{gate was}} {{constructed}} {{at the foot}} of the hill on the main road from London to Uxbridge, now Oxford Street, Bayswater Road and Holland Park Avenue along this part of its route. The point at which the turnpike gate stood was known as Notting Hill Gate. The gate was there to stop people passing along the road without paying. The proceeds were applied towards the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> road. The gate was removed in the 19th century and the high road was widened and straightened in the 1960s, involving the demolition of many buildings, the linking of two separate tube stations and the construction of two tower blocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{termites}} {{are thought}} {{to benefit from the}} association as the ants leave debris in the nest containing nitrogen and that this increases the availability <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> nutrient in an environment where it is scarce. They may also benefit from the ants protecting the nest from predators. The ants benefit as the termite nests provide an ideal location to raise broods, particularly of reproductive castes. The climate is suitable for this and the nests are easily defended against predators. Other Nasutitermes species have been found to produce anti-fungal compounds and these would also be beneficial to the ants although it is not known if N. corniger do produce such compounds.|$|E
25|$|Darius the Great's {{inscription}} at Bisotun, {{which dates}} to 522 BCE, lies some 1300 meters {{high in the}} mountains, and counts {{as one of the}} most famous sites in Near Eastern archeology. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and has been attracting visitors for centuries. The Behistun inscription is to Old Persian cuneiform what the Rosetta Stone is to Egyptian hieroglyphs: the trilingual inscription (in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian) was crucial in the decipherment of the script. The relief above the inscription depicts Darius facing nine rebels who objected to his crowning. At the king's feet lies Gaumata. The location <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>important</b> historical document is not coincidental: Gaumata, a usurper who is depicted as lying at Darius' feet, was a Medean and in Achaemenid times Behistun lay on the Medea-Parsa highway.|$|E
