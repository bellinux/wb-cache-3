5|$|After {{the end of}} the {{war there}} were {{extended}} arguments <b>over</b> <b>how</b> the pipelines should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the pipelines for $143,127,000, the largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property. The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the energy market in the north-east. The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957. The pipelines are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The end-user license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control <b>over</b> <b>how</b> the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge <b>over</b> <b>how</b> the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates <b>over</b> <b>how</b> evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute <b>over</b> <b>how</b> to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys <b>over</b> <b>how</b> to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, and the project was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate <b>over</b> <b>how</b> it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers <b>over</b> <b>how</b> best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E

Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus <b>over</b> <b>how</b> to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
