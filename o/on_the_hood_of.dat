Dancers dressed as cowboys vogued during the pre-show in provocative poses, lassoing each other and skating around the passersby. The stage was draped in an American flag. As the music started, the flag lifted to reveal a white Ford pickup truck from which Madonna emerged, singing [...] "Impressive Instant". Bare-chested male dancers encircled her, as she posed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> the truck and danced through the song.

A similar performance was done at Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, romance novel heroines were usually the [...] "good girls"; while the hero {{may have a}} fling {{with a woman who}} is highly sexually active, he {{generally}} married a less sexual, more sedate woman. [...] This reflected the general socio-cultural norms against a woman's blatant display of sexuality, which were also displayed in other mainstream media. [...] Flashbacks reveal that Sophie experienced this societal backlash in high school; she was humiliated by a classmate ridiculed her for having sex. [...] In {{the early part of the}} book, Sophie agrees to a purely physical affair with Phin, who resembles the boy to whom she lost her virginity. [...] He seduces Sophie by offering to pleasure her with no expectation of reciprocity, inviting her to explore her sexuality without fear of societal punishment. As Sophie begins to explore her sexuality, she compares their affair to a sexual school and casts Phin in the role of teacher. [...] Critic Kyra Kramer points out that because Phin is also the object of her sexual exploration, he becomes an ally instead of a master. [...] In one scene near the end of the book, Crusie describes Sophie sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> Phin's car, knees apart, leaning back on her hands. [...] This is a stereotypical scene of female submission to male fantasy, yet the scene ends with Sophie pushing Phin down and straddling him. [...] She now has the position of power. [...] Sophie's negotiation of the boundaries of the lessons, her sexual assertiveness, [...] "reverses normative female sexuality". As the novel progresses, Sophie begins to trust Phin, and she shifts her focus to fulfilling his fantasies. [...] This signals that their relationship is reaching a state of equality.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Ritchie's future husband George Pickow was {{introduced}} to folk music when he heard Cisco Houston and Woody Guthrie jamming every night in a tiny cabin at the left-wing Camp Unity summer camp in upstate New York. The Brooklyn-born Pickow, who had studied painting at Cooper Union and made training films for the Navy in World War II, went on {{to have a long}} career as a professional photographer and film maker. His career also included an extensive documentation of his wife's work and his photographs illustrated many of her books. Pickow and Ritchie met in 1948 at a square dance at the Henry Street Settlement. The following day, Pickow invited her to accompany him on a photo shoot at the Fulton Fish Market. [...] "The result ‚Äî Ms. Ritchie perched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> a truck, holding a rather large lobster ‚Äî was published in a trucking-industry magazine." [...] They married in 1950 and had two sons, Peter and Jon. In 1952, Pickow accompanied his wife on a Fulbright Scholarship to collect folksongs in Britain and Ireland. When Alan Lomax, then working out of London for the BBC, and his collaborator Peter Kennedy of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, decided to document the unique May Eve and May Day Festivals at Padstow in Cornwall, they selected Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the acclaimed 16-minute color film Oss Oss Wee Oss (1953). In 1961, Pickow and Lomax collaborated on a short film documentary about the Greenwich Village folk revival scene intended to be shown on the BBC. This never happened, however, and ten years later Alan's daughter Anna Lomax Wood, edited the surviving scraps and fragments in her father's office into a short film, [...] "Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass". In addition to Ritchie, Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass features what one reviewer called [...] "killer footage" [...] of performances by Clarence Ashley, Guy Carawan, Willie Dixon, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Roscoe Holcomb, Peter La Farge, Ernie Marrs, The New Lost City Ramblers, Memphis Slim, and the first known footage of a very young Doc Watson. In the audience are Maria Muldaur and also Bob Dylan, who can be seen clog dancing in the film's opening moments. Pickow, who had been in declining health for a long time, died December 10, 2010, two days after Ritchie's 88th birthday.|$|E
