5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{recovery}} in A Storm of Swords (2000), Tyrion finds {{that he has}} lost most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and a returned Tywin has assumed the position of Hand himself. Tyrion is appointed Master of Coin, the treasurer, {{as a reward for}} his successful leadership. After learning of a Tyrell plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead. Sympathetic to Sansa's situation, Tyrion leaves their marriage unconsummated, despite his father's orders to conceive a child with her as soon as possible. At the celebration of his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Joffrey is poisoned. Cersei promptly accuses Tyrion, who is arrested. His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict. He is heartbroken to find that even Shae has turned against him. In his grief, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, to which Cersei responds by naming the virtually unbeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Oberyn Martell agrees to fight for Tyrion but dies in the attempt. Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon to await his execution. Jaime frees him with the help of Varys, eventually confessing his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha. Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty and lies to Jaime that he did murder Joffrey. Before escaping the palace, Tyrion goes to confront his father, and finds Shae in Tywin's bed. After strangling her in a rage, Tyrion murders Tywin as well when he speaks ill of Tysha, and flees Westeros.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 75 minutes. The cars were {{split into two}} groups with the leading championship point-standing leaders and the fastest two drivers from the previous road course race composing the second group. Both groups were allowed 30 minutes on the circuit with a 15-minute break in {{between the two groups}} recording their lap times. Weather conditions were warm for the 75-minute session. De Ferran clinched his first pole position of the season, his second at Toronto, and the twelfth of his career with a time of 57.703 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Castroneves and had the pole position until de Ferran's lap. Bräck qualified third, Kanaan fourth and Tagliani fifth (all three drivers went off into the track's run-off areas but continued without damaging their cars.) Franchitti, Fernández, Tracy, Roberto Moreno and Scott Dixon rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Servià was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was 0.534 seconds off de Ferran's pace. He was followed by Carpentier in twelfth. Andretti, 13th, slid and hit the turn one tire barrier lightly with the left front section <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> cone; he later contacted the turn five wall with his right-rear tire on his final timed lap. Fittipaldi took 14th position, ahead of Herta who spun at turn nine without damaging his car. Vasser, da Matta, Michel Jourdain Jr., Gugelmin, Junqueira filled the next five places on the grid. Papis took 21st and was joined by Tora Takagi on the grid's eleventh row. 23rd-place qualifier Gidley made contact with Carpentier who was braking heavily for the turn eight right-hander and Gidley damaged his front suspension heavily with his front wheels out of line. Both drivers were unhurt. Zanardi took 24th position. Wilson and Nakano qualified {{at the back of the}} grid in 25th and 26th places; Wilson closely followed Nakano on his first timed lap made heavy contact with the rear-left of Nakano's car and went airborne briefly. Both drivers were uninjured but switched to their back-up cars as their primary chassis were heavily damaged.|$|E

25|$|Cicero's cognomen, or {{personal}} surname, {{comes from the}} Latin for chickpea, cicer. Plutarch explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> resembling a chickpea. However, {{it is more likely}} that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas. Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames. The famous family names of Fabius, Lentulus, and Piso come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas, respectively. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make Cicero more glorious than Scaurus ("Swollen-ankled") and Catulus ("Puppy").|$|E

Holy Bull then rallied and pulled away to win by three-quarters of a length. He {{suffered}} his first loss in the Fountain of Youth Stakes when he was caught in an early speed duel and then tired, finishing last. The loss was subsequently blamed on Holy Bull getting excited and breathing through his mouth instead <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> thus not getting enough air. Croll subsequently fit him with a new nose band and bit to keep his mouth closed.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil {{would not be able to}} be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E

500|$|The first {{character}} Nomura {{designed for}} Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{was inspired by}} actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said that [...] "obody understood it." [...] Squall is [...] tall, initially with longer hair and a more feminine appearance. After objections by game director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine. He added the scar across Squall's brow and the bridge <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> impulsively (to make the character more recognizable), leaving the description of its origin up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall's first illustration {{was used as a}} set up to create the world around him. The logo of the game which had Squall embracing Rinoa was left as an open interpretation for fans who still had not played the game. The scar in Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him.|$|E
500|$|The {{portrait}} is {{not particularly}} well preserved. There are yellowish layers of glaze over the face, probably later additions. The varnishes have degraded and lost their original colours. The panel has undergone a number of detrimental retouchings. In some instances, these have altered the sitter's appearance, most especially the removal of strands of fair hair below the chaperon. It has sustained structural damage, especially to the marble on the reverse. The National Gallery repaired some [...] "slight injuries" [...] when it came into their possession in 1857. Campbell notes a number of efforts by later restorers were imperfect and [...] "rather disfiguring", including touchings to the man's nostrils and eyelashes, and the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> There is a yellowish glaze over the eyes {{that seems to be}} either damage or overpaint. The panel is discoloured overall and suffers from aged and degenerated varnishes that make the original pigments hard to discern.|$|E

500|$|Kitase {{expressed}} a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" [...] being in relation to Japan); his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced.|$|E

500|$|Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, {{and worked}} {{on a number of}} BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he {{provided}} the musical interludes for a new BBC series Crazy People, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing [...] "Crazy Rhythm" [...] for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as [...] "Conk", on account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: [...] "That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica.
