Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people.

5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do with their lives, {{if they were not}} working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were {{alleged to have}} cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of}} the Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

NatWest was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were “facing questions <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers,” as the bank processed $1.1 million in Laundromat cash. Other banks facing scrutiny under the investigation included HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} ten-lap Milan criterium {{of the ninth}} stage, when the riders staged a protest <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> viewed as unsafe riding {{conditions}} in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo fell more than , and nearly {{died as a result}} of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.|$|E

25|$|The year 1198 {{was to be}} the nadir of Sverre's fortunes. In May Sverre {{launched}} his attempt to recapture Trøndelag. This time Sverre failed to achieve surprise and the Birkebeiner fleet consisted mostly of smaller ships. In the sea battle that followed, the Birkebeiners were soundly beaten. In the aftermath of this battle the Baglers further consolidated their hold on Trøndelag and many went <b>over</b> to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believed to be the winning side.|$|R

In a bloc, Kiryas Joel swung around 2,900 votes to Kelly's Democratic opponent, John Hall. The vote in Kiryas Joel was one reason Hall carried the election, which he did by 4,800 votes.|$|E
25|$|Garfield {{had been}} {{approached}} by Hollywood studios before—both Paramount and Warners offering screen tests—but talks had always stalled over a clause he wanted inserted in his contract, one {{that would allow him}} time off for stage work. Now Warner Bros. acceded to his demand, and Garfield signed a standard feature-player agreement—seven years with options—in Warner's New York office. Many in the Group were livid <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> considered his betrayal. Elia Kazan's reaction was different, suggesting that the Group did not so much fear that Garfield would fail, but that he would succeed. Jack Warner's first order of business was a change of name to John Garfield.|$|E

She left this position in 1979 to join RTÉ as a journalist and presenter during one period as a reporter and presenter for their Today Tonight programme. However, in RTÉ she and Alex White (then TV producer and now Labour Party TD) were attacked and criticised by a group led by Eoghan Harris associated with the Workers' Party <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> perceived as her bias towards Republican groups in the North. McAleese was critical of the Provisional IRA but believed it was important to hear their side of the story; she opposed the Harris faction's support for Section 31 which she believed was an attack on free speech. In 1981, she returned to the Reid Professorship, but continued to work part-time for RTÉ for a further four years. In 1987, she returned to Queen's University to become Director of the Institute of Professional Legal Studies. She stood, unsuccessfully, as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the Dublin South-East constituency at the 1987 general election, receiving 2,243 votes (5.9%).|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the season Ward and the series' crew sought to <b>over</b> come <b>what</b> <b>they</b> called the [...] "season four blues" [...] by writing more interesting and different stories than what had previously aired. The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar, Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, Ako Castuera, Jesse Moynihan, Bert Youn, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Steve Wolfhard while being produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios. Several compilation DVDs that contained episodes from the season were released after the season finished airing. The full season set was released on October 7, 2014 on DVD and Blu-ray.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} {{is presented as}} highly professional, {{to the point of}} being a [...] "workaholic". She is notably hard on Resident Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), admitting that Cristina reminds her of herself as a student. Despite her intentions to keep away from relationships, she becomes romantically involved with orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). The storyline was praised for its realistic portrayal of a developing same-sex relationship between two women, although consultants from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation expressed some concerns <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deemed the somewhat exploitative talk of a threesome between Hahn, Torres and Mark Sloan. Hahn was written out of Grey's Anatomy in November 2008, with Smith commenting that the decision originated with the ABC network rather than with series creator Shonda Rhimes.|$|E

[...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit.

500|$|This has {{resulted}} in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions. Since the unit was launched in 2006 more than 900 people have been filmed by the unit. Not {{all of these people}} are suspects in crime however, people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or if they have been stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances. Kieran Walsh, a civil liberties lawyer, said the unit's work [...] "could have implications" [...] for the force under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to privacy. He believes that filming must be a [...] "proportionate and reasonable" [...] response to a crime and that this {{does not appear to be}} the case as people are being targeted <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might do in the future. It is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but GMP currently anticipate it will be stored for 5years.|$|E

500|$|Surprisingly strong {{feelings}} of guilt were manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor's death in exile {{at the end of}} 1891. In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death [...] "aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler." [...] The overthrown monarchy was still a fresh memory to Brazilians, to which was added a feeling of remorse <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> perceived as an unjust exile, followed by his lonely demise. Some republicans [...] "reconsidered the long banishment and reflected upon the severity of such action." [...] Even they believed that PedroII deserved a better end, and nostalgia spread among them as they [...] "started to see in the Imperial epoch a happier time, a golden age, forever gone." [...] The Empire began to be viewed more tolerantly by the new governments, and its considerable achievements were openly recognized. Now appeared [...] "a feeling that there was once a time when Brazil was more respectable, more honest, and more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{document}} {{containing the}} Ordinances is dated 5 October, and contains forty-one articles. In the preamble, the Ordainers voiced their concern <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{perceived as the}} evil councilors of the king, the precariousness of the military situation abroad, and the danger of rebellion at home over the oppressive prises. The articles {{can be divided into}} different groups, the largest of which deals with limitations on the powers of the king and his officials, and the [...] substitution of these powers with baronial control. It was ordained that the king should appoint his officers only [...] "by the counsel and assent of the baronage, and that in parliament." [...] Furthermore, the king could no longer go to war without the consent of the baronage, nor could he make reforms of the coinage. Additionally, it was decided that parliament should be held at least once a year. Parallel to these decisions were reforms of the royal finances. The Ordinances banned what was seen as extortionate prises and customs, {{and at the same time}} declared that revenues were to be paid directly into the exchequer. This was a reaction to the rising trend of receiving revenues directly into the royal household; making all royal finances accountable to the exchequer allowed greater public scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|Each of the {{returning}} former cast members was signed to contracts stipulating {{that they would}} be paid for the pilot and the 13 episodes regardless of whether the series went into production. They were also given substantial pay increases <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had received on The Original Series. For example, Nichelle Nichols' pay was increased from $600 per episode to $8,000; and DeForest Kelley was paid $17,500 for the first four weeks, then $7,500 per episode {{for the rest of the}} first season. The problems with Nimoy and Shatner necessitated the creation of two new characters. In Goodwin's first draft show bible, he included descriptions for a new [...] "Ship's commander" [...] character, and a [...] "Young Vulcan". The latter character was specifically attributed as being a second-cousin of Spock, and also a half-human/half-Vulcan. He also added a new Yeoman character, but Roddenberry was concerned at the time about the character, writing to Livingston [...] "Simply adding a 'flunky' female to the bridge may not satisfy our needs for gender equality." [...] This discussion began the process that resulted in the creation of Ilia, a new female character who was not intended to replace one of the previous cast members. In charge of casting these new members of the crew was Robert Collins, who had been hired to direct the pilot. Xon would later be changed to a full-blooded Vulcan.|$|E

However, the most frequently cited approach to user-centred design, i. e. participatory design, can be both problematic and expensive to implement., particularly over the difficulty of finding and recruiting suitable participants. Simulation aids offer a potentially cost-effective replacement or complement to participatory design. This paper examines {{a number of the}} issues {{associated with the use of}} simulation aids when designing for Universal Access. It concludes that simulation aids can play an effective role, but need to be used with due consideration <b>over</b> <b>what</b> insights <b>they</b> provide...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, in {{response}} to privacy issues regarding social networking sites, Foursquare co-founder Naveen Selvadurai states that [...] "Users decide {{if they want to}} push to Twitter or Facebook, <b>over</b> <b>what</b> information <b>they</b> want to share and send" [...] and [...] "There is a lot of misunderstanding about location-based services. On Foursquare, if you don't want people to know you are on a date or with a friend at a certain place, then you don't have to let people know. You don't check in."
