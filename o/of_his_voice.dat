5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} of The Dream of Gerontius. He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also appeared {{from time to time in}} operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The quality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E

5000|$|In 1995, Brian said: [...] "That {{was written}} inside Brother Studios in Santa Monica. At the end, where Dennis goes (sings) [...] "Find a ride", we put two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voices</b> on there, {{and it sounded}} fan-tas-tic! Fuckin' fantastic from Dennis." ...|$|R

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Kasumi {{travel to}} the planet Bekenstein, where Hock is {{throwing}} a party at his mansion {{for some of the}} galaxy's richest people. After getting samples of Hock's DNA from his private quarters, recording a sample <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> and disabling the vault's defenses, Kasumi and Shepard infiltrate the vault. As Kasumi starts cracking the graybox, the pair is detected and attacked by Hock's forces. Kasumi and Shepard eventually manage to escape in a shuttle after destroying a gunship piloted by Hock. After the mission, Kasumi accesses the graybox and sees her partner one last time. A hologram of Okuda reveals the data, saying that it would impact humanity's reputation if made public. He begs her to destroy the data along with his memories. Kasumi has trouble letting him go, showing that their relationship was much more than professional. Shepard can persuade Kasumi to follow Keiji's wishes or keep the data.|$|E

50|$|In 1909, at the Prime Minister's request, {{he joined}} the South African {{delegation}} as legal adviser, and submitted the draft South Africa Act at the National Convention in London. This was in spite <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voicing</b> considerable problems with many of its provisions, particularly those pertaining to franchise.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, {{to keep a}} {{souvenir}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> before it broke, Maunier decided to sing with Clemence Saint-Preux and had released the single, Concerto pour deux voix, which was in turn an adaptation of Concerto pour une Voix.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 2012, he was {{the first}} human being to have his voice {{broadcast}} on the surface of Mars. Although the rover has no speakers, it received the transmission <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and then beamed it back to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Today, Urlus is {{regarded}} as {{being one of the}} very best Wagner singers of all time. He made many acoustic discs of operatic arias and duets, mainly for HMV and Edison Records, which have been reissued on CD—most notably by Marston Records and the Preiser label. These recordings confirm the outstanding quality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> and the excellence and versatility of his musicianship.|$|E
50|$|Ismail Haron was {{acclaimed}} {{a celebrity}} by the Malaysia|Malay music buffs in Singapore & Malaysia. Because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deep husky <b>voice,</b> {{he was called}} the Tom Jones <b>of</b> Singapore and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> did remind <b>of</b> the English legendary singer.|$|R

25|$|The radio-announcer that Peter {{listens to}} on the rainy day near the {{beginning}} of the film is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson. Keynes' voice broke during filming, so some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> track had to be re-looped by his sister Soumaya. Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones' father.|$|E
25|$|Kozlovsky was {{well-known}} to be a favourite {{singer of}} Joseph Stalin. Stalin used to invite Kozlovsky {{to come over}} whenever he wanted {{to listen to the}} sound <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> even {{in the middle of the}} night. So pleased was Stalin with Kozlovsky's singing, that he once kissed him and then himself sang to the piano accompaniment of Kozlovsky. Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was never allowed to leave its borders.|$|E
25|$|Houdini {{made the}} only known {{recordings}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> on Edison wax cylinders on October 29, 1914, in Flatbush, New York. On them, Houdini practices several different introductory speeches for his famous Chinese water torture cell. He also invites his sister, Gladys, to recite a poem. Houdini then recites the same poem in German. The six wax cylinders were discovered {{in the collection of}} magician John Mulholland after his death in 1970. They are part of the David Copperfield collection.|$|E

5000|$|Reviews of Leonhard's {{performances}} are wide-ranging. He {{has been noted}} for a [...] "dark, steely, throaty bass" [...] with mundane performance, although this is perhaps due to Leonhard being out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice's</b> comfort zone regarding range. Conversely, he was noted for having a [...] "luscious and lovely Italian voice" [...] with a splendid, spontaneous sense of humor.|$|R
25|$|In 1932, Arbuckle {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Warner Bros. to star under his own name in a series of six two-reel comedies, to be filmed at the Vitagraph studios in Brooklyn. These six short films constitute the only recordings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> Silent-film comedian Al St. John (Arbuckle's nephew) and actors Lionel Stander and Shemp Howard appeared with Arbuckle. The films were very successful in America, although when Warner Bros. attempted to release the first one (Hey, Pop!) in the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Censors cited the 10-year-old scandal and refused to grant an exhibition certificate.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fourth}} show, Charlie Dominici {{was let go}} because the band was {{starting}} to feel the limitations <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like Bruce Dickinson or Geoff Tate, and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a front man. Shortly after, however, the band Marillion asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was given the opportunity to perform one last time. It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Graham Bell died in 1922, {{and until}} {{recently}} no recordings <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> were known to survive. On April 23, 2013, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History, which houses a collection of Volta Laboratory materials, announced {{that one of its}} fragile Volta experimental sound recordings, a deteriorated wax-on-cardboard disc that can now be played safely by an optical scanning technology, had preserved the inventor's Scottish-tinged voice. Museum staff working with scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory had also revived the voice of his father, Alexander Melville Bell, from an 1881 recording in the wax-filled groove of a modified Edison tinfoil cylinder phonograph.|$|E

25|$|On 21 December 2012, Coronation Street {{produced}} a Text Santa special entitled A Christmas Corrie which featured Norris Cole {{in the style}} of Scrooge, being visited by the ghosts of dead characters. The ghosts were Mike Baldwin, Maxine Peacock, Derek Wilton and Vera Duckworth. Other special guests include Torvill and Dean, Lorraine Kelly and Sheila Reid. The episode concluded with Norris learning the error of his ways and dancing on the cobbles. The original plan for this feature was to have included Jack Duckworth, along with Vera, but actor Bill Tarmey died before filming commenced. In the end a recording <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> was played.|$|E
25|$|Rouvas had no vocal lessons {{as a boy}} {{and taught}} himself {{primarily}} by ear, so during the recording of his first album he had to learn music theory in a short time. His voice developed significantly since his early teenaged performances. Rouvas' detractors have criticized his voice as average, or limited, contending that his appeal is based on image. Whatever the assessment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> {{it has often been}} overshadowed by showmanship and appearance in the media; many preferred to watch him perform than to listen to him. These criticisms diminished by the second decade of Rouvas' career; his technical skills (range, power and versatility in particular) and expression are better appreciated.|$|E
25|$|He {{formed a}} three-man group with his cousins, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones, {{who would later}} be known as RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard. At the time he didn't like the sound <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>voice.</b> The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, and later All in Together, saw the three rapping and DJing, {{switching}} names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol' Dirty would travel from Brooklyn out to Staten Island {{to meet up with}} their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles. He left school in the 10th grade, but nurtured his affection for science as he developed his skills as a lyricist.|$|E
