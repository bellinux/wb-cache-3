5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>ADHD</b> and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The {{side effects of}} Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence <b>of</b> <b>ADHD</b> {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that urinary {{excretion}} <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> {{can be detected}} readily and quantitated accurately. The ADH excretion in normal subjects is inhibited following the administration of a water load and stimulated following water deprivation. It appears that measurement <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> excretion in man provides a means of quantitating alterations in neurohypophyseal ADH secretion. By determining not only the basal excretion <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> but also the response to such physiological influences as water loading and dehydration, it becomes possible to study the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> release. Thus, the ability to extract ADH efficiently from urine combined with a sensitive and specific technique for determination <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> concentration allows the exploration of regulatory systems for ADH control in the normal state {{as well as the}} etiological role <b>of</b> altered <b>ADH</b> secretion in clinical disorders of water balance...|$|R

40|$|Expression of {{the alcohol}} {{dehydrogenase}} gene (<b>ADH)</b> <b>of</b> Arabidopsis is induced during hypoxia. Because many plants increase their ethylene production {{in response to}} hypoxic stress, we examined in this report whether ethylene {{is involved in the}} hypoxic induction <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> in Arabidopsis. We found that the hypoxic induction <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> can be partially inhibited by aminooxy acetic acid, an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. This partial inhibition can be reversed by the addition of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid, a direct precursor of ethylene. In addition, the hypoxic induction <b>of</b> the <b>ADH</b> gene is also reduced in etr 1 - 1 and ein 2 - 1, two ethylene insensitive mutants in ethylene-signaling pathways, whereas the addition of exogenous ethylene or an increase in cellular ethylene alone does not induce ADH under normoxic conditions. Kinetic analyses <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> mRNA accumulation indicated that an ethylene signal is required for the induction <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> during later stages of hypoxia. Therefore, we conclude that ethylene is needed, but not sufficient for, the induction <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> in Arabidopsis during hypoxia...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol is an {{addictive}} {{substance that}} is often misused worldwide, including in Indonesia. Ninety percent of the alcohol that enters the body will be metabolized in the liver using the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme. It is important to determine the activity <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> enzyme and ADH 3 gene polymorphism on alcoholics and non-alcoholics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The aim {{of the study is}}  to determine ADH activity and identify ADH 3 gene polymorphism of alcoholics and non-alcoholics in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This study was an observational study with a cross-sectional design method. Blood samples were taken from 71 Javanese alcoholics and 71 non-alcoholics of Javanese descent in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The participants were initially requested to sign an informed consent form. Examination <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> enzyme activity used the spectrophotometry method and ADH 3 gene polymorphism was assessed with PCR-RFLP using Ssp I restriction enzyme. The activity <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> enzyme in all individuals appeared to be a slower type. The average of the ethanol value of alcoholics and non-alcoholics were 0. 05554 mM and 0. 0758 mM respectively. Gene type <b>of</b> alcoholics were <b>ADH</b> 3 * 2 (75. 4 %), ADH 3 * 1 / 3 * 2 (21. 5 %), and ADH 3 * 1 (3. 1 %), and non-alcoholics were ADH 3 * 2 (88. 6 %), ADH 3 * 1 / 3 * 2 (10. 0 %), and ADH 3 * 1 (1. 4 %). There {{were no significant differences between}} the activity <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> with polymorphism <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> 3 gene in either alcoholics and non-alcoholics (p> 0, 05).

40|$|Dry {{seeds of}} Acacia erioloba, a {{southern}} African desert tree species, contain high levels <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> which separate into six electrophoretic (PAGE) bands in axes and five bands in cotyledons.

The number <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> isoenzymes and activity decreases after germination, this change being more rapid in axes than in cotyledons. Decline in activity appears to require active protein synthesis. Cycloheximide and nitrogen prevent, but oxygen enhances loss <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> activity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} ultraviolet-B {{radiation}} (UV-B) on accessory function of human blood adherent mononuclear cells (ADH) for antigen and mitogen-induced responses, and production by <b>ADH</b> <b>of</b> the amplifying cytokine interleukin 1 (IL- 1) were examined. Responder lymphocytes were rendered accessory cell dependent by treatment of nonadherent cells with OKIal+complement. UV-B depressed accessory function <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> in a dose-dependent manner. UV-B at 5 mJ/cm 2 decreased accessory function of 2 x 10 (4) ADH for tetanus toxoid-induced responses (measured as incorporation of 3 H-thymidine) by 84 % (P less than 0. 001, n = 6) and phytohaemagglutinin-induced responses 91 % (P less than 0. 001, n = 4). UV-B also decreased accessory activity of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} but not Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells for a PPD-reactive T cell line. Viability was approximately 90 % 0 - 72 h after exposure <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> to 5 mJ/cm 2 of UV-B. Interleukin 1 (IL- 1) activity <b>of</b> supernatants <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> was assayed on C 3 H/HeJ mouse thymocytes. Pretreatment <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> with 5 mJ/cm 2 UV-B decreased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL- 1 activity from 169 +/- 34 (mean U/ml +/- s. e.) to 4 +/- 1 (P less than 0. 01, n = 4). Lysates of UV-B irradiated. LPS-stimulated ADH had no discernible IL- 1 activity. Addition of IL- 1 partially restored accessory activity <b>of</b> UV-B irradiated <b>ADH</b> for lymphocyte responses to TT. Exposure <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> to TT or PHA for 30 min before irradiation blocked the inhibitory effect of UV-B on accessory activity. Thus, low doses of UV-B are deleterious to accessory function and to production of IL- 1 by ADH.

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of dopamine re-uptake inhibitors in treating the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>ADHD</b> {{has led to}} the hypothesis that ADHD may arise from low tonic levels of dopamine (particularly in the fronto-limbic circuitry), but evidence in support of this theory is mixed.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{were used}} in the past in the {{clinical}} treatment <b>of</b> <b>ADHD,</b> though they are not typically used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin, Attentin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects <b>of</b> <b>ADHD</b> than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to no benefits on attention.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the role <b>of</b> alcohol dehydrogenase (<b>ADH)</b> in the metabolism and survival of hypoxic maize (Zea mays L.) root tips. The {{dependence of the}} rate of ethanolic fermentation, cytoplasmic pH, and viability on the activity <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> in maize root tips during extreme hypoxia was determined. Maize lines with ADH activities differing over about a 200 -fold range were studied. Effects of genetic background were controlled by comparing pairs of F 4 progeny of crosses between mutant (low ADH activity) and reference inbred lines. The capacity of hypoxic root tips to perform ethanolic fermentation exhibited a dependence on ADH activity only at activities found in Adh 1 nulls. The ability of maize root tips to withstand prolonged and extreme hypoxia was like-wise independent <b>of</b> <b>ADH</b> activity, except at the lowest activities. Root tips that exhibited lower tolerance of hypoxia had more acidic cytoplasm during extreme hypoxia.
