25|$|Modern {{attempts}} at forming a popular Canadian nationalist party have failed. The National Party of Canada {{was the most}} successful of recent attempts. Led by former publisher Mel Hurtig the Nationals received more than 183,000 votes or 1.38% {{of the popular vote}} in the 1993 election. Infighting however led to the party's demise shortly afterwards. This was followed by the formation of the Canadian Action Party in 1997. Created by a former Liberal Minister of Defence, Paul Hellyer, the CAP has failed to attract significant attention from the electorate since that time. An <b>organic</b> <b>farmer</b> and nationalist activist from Saskatchewan named David Orchard attempted to bring a nationalist agenda to the forefront of the former Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In spite of attracting thousands of new members to a declining party he was unsuccessful in taking over the leadership and preventing the merger with the former Canadian Alliance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{confirm or}} refute the {{hypothesis}} that <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> have higher sperm concentrations than traditional farmers. METHODS: Traditional and <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> were selected randomly from central registers, and 171 traditional <b>farmers</b> and 85 <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> delivered one semen sample {{before the start of}} the spraying season. The participation rate was 28. 8 % among traditional farmers and 42. 9 % among <b>organic</b> <b>farmers.</b> RESULTS: The median sperm concentration for traditional and <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> was 58 million/ml and 64 million/ml, respectively. After adjustment for several confounders, sperm concentration, total count, proportion of non-vital spermatozoa, sperm chromatin structure, and motility variables did not differ significantly between the two groups. The traditional farmers had a significantly lower proportion of normal spermatozoa, but this result was not confirmed in a second sample. <b>Organic</b> <b>farmers</b> had slightly higher inhibin B concentration and testosterone/sex hormone binding globulin ratio. CONCLUSION: Despite slight differences in concentrations of reproductive hormones, no significant differences in conventional measures of semen quality were found between <b>organic</b> and traditional <b>farmers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Farmers {{have been}} {{characterized}} as people whose {{ties to the}} land have given them a deep awareness of natural cycles, appreciation for natural beauty and sense of responsibility as stewards. At the same time, {{their relationship to the}} land has been characterized as more utilitarian than that of others who are less directly dependent on its bounty. This paper explores this tension by comparing the attitudes and beliefs of a group of conventional farmers to those of a group of <b>organic</b> <b>farmers.</b> It was found that while both groups reject the idea that a farmer???s role is to conquer nature, <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> were significantly more supportive of the notion that humans should live in harmony with nature. <b>Organic</b> <b>farmers</b> also reported a greater awareness of and appreciation for nature in their relationship with the land. Both groups view independence as a main benefit of farming and a lack of financial reward as its main drawback. Overall, conventional farmers report more stress in their lives although they also view themselves in a caretaker role for the land more than do the <b>organic</b> <b>farmers.</b> In contrast, <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> report more satisfaction with their lives, a greater concern for living ethically, and a stronger perception of community. Finally, both groups are willing to have their rights limited (<b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> somewhat more so) but they do not trust the government to do so. ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{advances}} {{two lines}} of academic discussion. First, our study adds to the existing literature on organic farming. Even though previous literature on pioneer <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> has identified the attitudes among conventional farming community and social stigma as barriers to organic conversion (e. g. Rigby et al. 2001), it has not addressed the ways how pioneer <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> were coping with the social stigma. By demonstrating pioneer <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> as institutional entrepreneurs who challenged the existing institutional order by overcame the stigmatizing cultural categories at the time. Second, our paper further contributes to stigma management literature by demonstrating how stigmatization {{can be understood as}} an empowering condition, thus enabling institutional entrepreneurship. Thus, we argue that the fact that pioneer <b>organic</b> <b>farmers</b> did not accept the legitimacy of stigmatizing attributes of organic farming is an important, but not a sufficient precondition for mainstreaming the idea of organic farming...|$|R
