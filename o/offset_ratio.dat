Cap and trade programs have built for the particle matters (PM 10), sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in 2010. The <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> was designed as 1. 0 or 1. 2 various on the offset sources. The fixed <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> setting is suitable for PM 10, SOx, and NOx since their characters are unitary. However, VOCs include a variety of chemicals, {{some of which may}} have short- or long-term adverse health effects. Even the same pollutant trading amount cannot guarantee the same health risk or environmental impacts. It would induced the highly uncertainty of air quality for the fixed <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> system. This study therefore tried to create a new methodology based on the pollutant impact strength of health and environment for determining the <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> of VOCs. An equation for calculating the <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> of VOCs was proposed and evaluated by case study.

The model of EVC surface topography is established based on curved surface remove function {{under the assumption that}} the tool edge is sharp enough. And simulation analysis of surface topography is conducted with different feed offset ratios. Results indicate that RMS change with feed offset ratios λ. The range of RMS is larger when feed <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> ranges from both 0 to 0. 4 and 0. 6 to 1, while the range is smaller when feed <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> changes from 0. 4 to 0. 6.

40|$|Objective. The {{presence}} of radiological signs of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) {{is not necessarily}} associated with symptoms. Hence, the prevalence of cam and pincer deformities in the overall population may be underestimated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to screen an unselected cohort of people without hip symptoms for native radiological signs of cam and pincer deformities to determine their actual prevalence. Materials and Methods. 110 asymptomatic patients had AP pelvis X-rays and cross-table hip X-rays performed. We evaluated the images for the {{presence of}} cross-over signs and measured lateral center edge (LCE) angles, alpha angles (α-angles), and femoral <b>offset</b> <b>ratios.</b> Results. Positive cross-over signs were seen in 34 %; LCE angles > 40 ° in 13 %; and femoral <b>offset</b> <b>ratios</b> 50 °. Male patients showed significantly higher α-angles, lower <b>offset</b> <b>ratios,</b> and a higher prevalence of cross-over signs. In contrast, female patients had significantly higher LCE angles. Conclusion. According to our data, radiological signs of cam and pincer deformities are common in asymptomatic people. In clinical practice, patients presenting with hip pain and radiological signs of FAI should undergo further diagnostic evaluation. However, in asymptomatic patients, no further evaluation is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Offsetting is {{a policy}} {{instrument}} intended to provide flexibility for development. We developed a simple calculator to predict when no net loss is feasible using biodiversity <b>offsetting.</b> Assuming <b>offset</b> <b>ratios</b> ≤ 10 : 1 are indicative of operational feasibility and employing a discount rate of 3 %, we predicted that no net loss is feasible where biodiversity can be restored within 55 years, which restricts the impacts on biodiversity that can be offset using restoration. Alternatively, no net loss is feasible by avoiding loss to biodiversity that is declining under the counterfactual {{at an annual rate}} ≥ 6 %. However, this is considerably higher than typical background rates of biodiversity loss so restricts where avoided-loss offsets are feasible. No net loss is theoretically feasible in the broadest range of circumstances if biodiversity gains are provided in advance of development. However, these gains are procured by restoration or avoided loss, so constraints presented by these approaches also apply. We concluded that no net loss is feasible in a limited range of development scenarios unless <b>offset</b> <b>ratios</b> greater than 10 : 1 are more widely tolerated...|$|R

40|$|Background: Femoroacetabular {{impingement}} {{has been}} postulated as the important cause of primary osteoarthritis in non dysplastic hips. We postulated that the rarity of primary osteoarthritis of hip in Indian population could {{be attributable to}} morphological differences, specifically to a lower prevalence of abnormal head-neck morphology. We conducted an anthropometric study to evaluate the prevalence of abnormal head-neck offset in Indian population and to correlate it with the low prevalence of primary osteoarthrosis in the Indian population. Materials and Methods: The computed tomography (CT) images of 85 apparently normal hips were analysed. An axial image was created parallel to the central axis of the femoral neck and passing {{through the center of}} the femoral head using coronal scout view. This image was then used to calculate alpha and beta angles and the head-neck <b>offset</b> <b>ratio.</b> The measurements were made by two independent observers on two different occasions. Results: The prevalence of abnormal head-neck <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> was 11. 7 % and the mean alpha and beta angles were 45. 6 ° and 40. 6 °, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients for intra-observer and inter-observer agreement were, respectively, 0. 84 and 0. 80 for alpha angle, 0. 80 and 0. 77 for beta angle and 0. 78 and 0. 75 for head-neck <b>offset</b> <b>ratio.</b> The values were similar to those reported in the western population. Conclusion: The differences in the prevalence of hip osteoarthritis in Indian and western populations are not attributable to variation in the prevalence of abnormal head-neck offset...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity offset {{areas may}} {{compensate}} for ecological {{damage caused by}} human activity elsewhere. One way of determining the <b>offset</b> <b>ratio,</b> or the compensation area needed, is to divide the present conservation value of the development site by the predicted future conservation value of a compensation area of the same size. Matching mean expected utility {{in this way is}} deficient because it ignores uncertainty and time lags in the growth of conservation value in compensation areas. Instead, we propose an uncertainty analytic framework for calculating what we call robustly fair offset ratios, which guarantee a high enough probability of the exchange producing at least as much conservation value in the offset areas than is lost from the development site. In particular, we analyze how the fair <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> is influenced by uncertainty in the effectiveness of restoration action, correlation between success of different compensation areas, and time discounting. We find that very high offset ratios may be needed to guarantee a robustly fair exchange, compared to simply matching mean expected utilities. These results demonstrate that considerations of uncertainty, correlated success/failure, and time discounting {{should be included in the}} determination of the <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> to avoid a significant risk that the exchange is unfavorable for conservation in the long run. This is essential because the immediate loss is certain, whereas future gain is uncertain. The proposed framework is also applicable to the case when offset areas already hold conservation value and do not require restoration action, in which case uncertainty about the conservation outcome will be lower...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} performed {{to determine the}} mass flow and thrust augmentation associated with the flow of a two-dimensional incompressible jet issued parallel to an adjacent offset wall. A theoretical analysis based on a linear static pressure profile across the jet exit reveals that thrust augmentation is possible only for a wall offset of less than {{one half of the}} nozzle exit width. Mass flow augmentation measurements are in reasonable agreement with the proposed theory. Augmented mass flow of over three percent is observed directly, while thrust augmentation in excess of three percent is predicted when measured values of the pressure difference across the exiting jet are supplied to the theory. Measurements of the separation cavity length are presented which complement those given by previous investigators by extending the range to small values of the ratio of the wall offset to the slot height. For large <b>offset</b> <b>ratios</b> it is found that the cavity length approaches 1. 25 times the wall offset distance. The initial radius of curvature of the jet centerline is found to be substantially greater than the mean radius of curvature over the cavity length, thereby indicating that the trajectory of the jet does not follow the arc of a circle as has been previously assumed...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The terrestrial ecosystems of North America {{have been identified}} as a sink of atmospheric CO 2 though there is no consensus on the magnitude. However, the emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases (CH 4 and N 2 O) may offset or even overturn the climate cooling effect induced by the CO 2 sink. Using a coupled biogeochemical model, in this study, we have estimated the combined global warming potentials (GWP) of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes in North American terrestrial ecosystems and quantified the relative contributions of environmental factors to the GWP changes during 1979 – 2010. The uncertainty range for contemporary global warming potential has been quantified by synthesizing the existing estimates from inventory, forward modeling, and inverse modeling approaches. Our “best estimate ” of net GWP for CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes was − 0. 50 ± 0. 27 Pg CO 2 eq/year (1 Pg= 1015 g) in North American terrestrial ecosystems during 2001 – 2010.

40|$|Biodiversity {{offsetting}} {{is widely}} applied but its effectiveness is rarely assessed. We evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} a nest box program intended to offset clearing of hollow-bearing trees associated with a freeway upgrade in southern Australia. The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of nest boxes in nearby woodland (1 : 1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 nest boxes in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of nest boxes. For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of nest box use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0 - 0. 76 % of accessible nest boxes used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of nest boxes by the squirrel glider (0 - 2. 1 % of accessible nest boxes used per survey period). Rates of nest box use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of nest box attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees.
