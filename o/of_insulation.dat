5|$|The {{sea otter}} (Enhydra lutris) is a marine mammal {{native to the}} coasts of the {{northern}} and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh between , making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> panels.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form <b>of</b> <b>insulation,</b> which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E

40|$|Accurately {{assessing}} the ageing status <b>of</b> oil-paper <b>insulation</b> in transformer is essential and important. Polarization and Depolarization Current (PDC) technique {{is effective in}} {{assessing the}} condition <b>of</b> oil-paper <b>insulation</b> system. Though the PDC behaviour <b>of</b> mineral oil-paper <b>insulation</b> has been widely investigated, there is no report {{about how to make}} the quantitative analysis <b>of</b> mineral oil-paper <b>insulation</b> ageing condition by PDC. The PDC characteristics <b>of</b> mineral oil-paper <b>insulation</b> samples were investigated over the ageing period at 110 °C. A new method for assessing the ageing condition <b>of</b> mineral oil-paper <b>insulation</b> by calculating the depolarization charge quantity was proposed.

5|$|Salyut 6, {{launched}} on a Proton 8K82K rocket on 29 September 1977, marked {{the switch from}} engineering development stations to routine operations, and united the most effective elements {{from each of the}} previous stations. Its navigation system, made up of the Delta semi-automatic computer to depict the station's orbit and the Kaskad system to control its orientation, was based on that used on Salyut 4, as was its power system, which consisted of a trio of steerable solar panels together producing a peak of 4kilowatts of power over 51m². The station's thermal regulation systems, which made use of a sophisticated arrangement <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> and radiators, was also derived from that used on Salyut 4. In addition, Salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on Salyut 3, and controlled its orientation using gyrodynes first tested on that station.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> {{was used to}} keep the {{building}} warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of layering {{can be used}} to provide a wider range <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> possibilities from a relatively small range of underwear items, however this can only be done before entering the water. Most dry suit underwear insulates by a trapped layer of air in the garment, and this is largely lost if the air is replaced by water in a flooded suit, so as a general rule, insulation is proportional to the combined thickness of the undergarments. The layering principle shows that the option of two layers of undergarment in two thicknesses allows three levels <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> to be selected. Thin only, thick only, and both layers.|$|E

25|$|Stray voltage is the {{occurrence}} of electrical potential between two objects that ideally should not have any voltage difference between them. Small voltages often exist between two grounded objects in separate locations, due to normal current flow in the power system. Large voltages can appear on the enclosures of electrical equipment due to a fault in the electrical power system, such as a failure <b>of</b> <b>insulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most often, {{magnetic}} wire {{is composed of}} fully annealed, electrolytically refined copper to allow closer winding when making electromagnetic coils.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>insulation.</b> They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.|$|E
25|$|A bear's fur {{is often}} very thick, {{and it can}} {{function}} much like armor. In situations between bears and other predators, such as humans, this thick fur acts with the bear's thick skin and layers of fat as a buffer against most physical attacks, sometimes buffering to some extent even against firearms. According to Charles Fergus' Wild Guide: Bears, bear fur is also a source <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> that allows bears to inhabit almost any habitat, from the hot jungles inhabited by sun bears and sloth bears to the frozen tundra inhabited by polar bears, thus occupying most of the same territory as man.|$|E
