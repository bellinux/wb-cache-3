25|$|One recent {{explanation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> ROC AUC is that {{reducing the}} ROC Curve {{to a single}} number {{ignores the fact that}} it is about the tradeoffs between the different systems or performance points plotted and not the performance of an individual system, as well as ignoring the possibility of concavity repair, so that related alternative measures such as Informedness or DeltaP are recommended. These measures are essentially equivalent to the Gini for a single prediction point with DeltaP' = Informedness = 2AUC-1, whilst DeltaP = Markedness represents the dual (viz. predicting the prediction from the real class) and their geometric mean is the Matthews correlation coefficient.|$|E
25|$|There were exceptions, of course. The {{first person}} known to {{publicly}} {{address this issue}} was Bob Bemer, who had noticed it in 1958 {{as a result of}} work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the government of the United States and the ISO aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>with</b> little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, Erik Naggum was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.|$|E

500|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{creating}} [...] "mytharc" [...] for {{the writers}} {{was due to}} the fact that, because there were so few mythology episodes each season, they were often forced to put as much material as they could into each episode. Originally, {{a large portion of the}} episode was supposed to reveal the history of the Syndicate via flashback. Reportedly, these scenes would have featured younger versions of Bill Mulder (played by Peter Donat), The Smoking Man, Dr. Openshaw, the Elders, and many others. However, this never panned out, and Carter and Spotnitz had to reframe the episode around narration courtesy of the Smoking Man, which was filmed and edited under extreme pressure near the end of production. While the previous episode, [...] "Two Fathers", was titled after the duality of Bill Mulder and The Smoking Man, this episode was titled [...] "One Son" [...] to reflect the fact that Mulder was the only remaining son of either of these fathers, after the shooting of Jeffrey Spender and the rejection of Alex Krycek.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} Jesse {{and his two}} Jewish {{partners}} arrived with a request for permits to operate, they were immediately rebuffed by an angered General Grant for presuming on the Army and his patience. The incident had been indicative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> cotton speculators in general who often collaborated with Union Officers, much to the frustration of General Grant. Various modern historians believe that Jesse's arrival with two prominent Jewish cotton speculators from Cincinnati is largely what led Grant in 1862 to issue General Order 11 expelling all Jews from his district. Jesse and his partners were instructed to leave the district on the next train going north. The incident {{proved to be an}} embarrassment for Grant which once again placed his father and himself on opposing sides of a serious issue.

2500|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> voter {{registration}} {{was a lack}} of agreement between Polisario and Morocco over who could claim Saharawi ethnicity and who should be allowed to vote on the referendum.

[...] In addition, Morocco may have [...] "improperly influenced Sahrawi tribal leaders who live in the Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara." [...] The UN moved 373 peacekeepers into the area to help validate Western Saharan voters. Polisario believed that Morocco was identifying tribal groups as voters who did not have a close connection to Western Sahara. During this time, King Hassan also moved 37,000 people from Morocco into Western Sahara to act as potential voters, which [...] "infuriated Polisario and shocked the peacekeepers." [...] Polisario believed that limiting voters to those were listed as [...] "Western Saharan" [...] on the 1974 Spanish census would lead to a vote for independence and did not want additional voters identified.|$|E

Some of these are legal in the country they are {{manufactured}} in, but do not meet BS 1363 - these can be brought into the UK by unsuspecting travellers, or people purchasing electrical goods online. They can also be purchased through many UK electrical component distributors. There are also counterfeit plugs which appear to meet the standards (and are marked as such) but do not in fact comply. Legislation was introduced, with the last revision in 1994, to require plugs sold to meet the technical standard. [...] Counterfeit products are regularly seized when found, to enforce the safety standards and to protect the approval marks and trademarks of imitated manufacturers. [...] The pressure group PlugSafe reported in March 2014 that since August 2011 [...] "thousands" [...] of listings of products including illegal plugs had been removed from the UK websites ebay.co.uk and amazon.co.uk.

60|$|In {{favour of}} the theory which I have briefly outlined, I do not claim that it is {{certainly}} true. Apart from the likelihood of mistakes, {{much of it is}} avowedly hypothetical. What I do claim for the theory is that it may be true, and that this is more than can be said for any other theory except the closely analogous theory of Leibniz. The difficulties besetting realism, the confusions obstructing any philosophical account of physics, the dilemma resulting from discrediting sense-data, which yet remain the sole source of our knowledge of the outer world--all these are avoided by the theory which I advocate. This does not prove the theory to be true, since probably many other theories might be invented which would have the same merits. But it does prove that the theory has a better chance of being true than any of its present competitors, and it suggests that what can be known with certainty is likely to be discoverable by taking our theory as a starting-point, and gradually freeing it from all such assumptions as seem irrelevant, unnecessary, or unfounded. On these grounds, I recommend it to attention as a hypothesis and a basis for further work, though not as itself a finished or adequate solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> which it deals.|$|E
