5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted {{an article}} on its website {{as part of its}} {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained anastrozole, clomiphene citrate, nandrolone, <b>oxandrolone,</b> stanozolol, and testosterone. WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness program launched in February 2006.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are {{the parent}} {{structures}} of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives <b>oxandrolone,</b> oxymetholone, and stanozolol.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{commonly}} used, methyltestosterone {{is one of the}} few AAS {{that remains}} available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone (and esters), nandrolone decanoate, <b>oxandrolone,</b> oxymetholone, and fluoxymesterone.|$|E
25|$|AAS use in {{adolescents}} quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as <b>oxandrolone</b> {{are used in}} the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height.|$|E
25|$|Future {{attacks of}} {{hereditary}} angioedema {{can be prevented}} {{by the use of}} androgens such as danazol, <b>oxandrolone</b> or methyltestosterone. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, <b>oxandrolone,</b> mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Aside from 5α-reductase, {{aromatase}} may inactivate testosterone signaling in {{skeletal muscle}} and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, {{in addition to}} being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia, might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison. In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks). In accordance, DHT, mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT), and mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like <b>oxandrolone,</b> oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.|$|E
25|$|In late 1989, Robinson gave an {{interview}} with Stern in West Germany accusing a number of figures in American track and field of using and distributing performance-enhancing drugs. In October, The Athletics Congress (later USA Track & Field) had allowed the voluntary resignation of Robinson's former coach Chuck DeBus for giving banned substances to his athletes. Robinson said in Stern that, while staying at his house in 1982, he had seen Carl Lewis inject himself with a white fluid – what he believed to be testosterone. Furthermore, {{he said he had}} seen Tom Tellez (Lewis' coach) distribute blue pills to his athletes and claimed that these were banned steroids. Robinson had begun training with Bob Kersee in 1987 and he claimed that the coach had advised him on steroid use and given him two types of tablets; <b>oxandrolone</b> and metandienone. Robinson also claimed that he had personally sold a 10-cubic centimetre vial of human growth hormone to Florence Griffith-Joyner in March 1988, just months before she ran two world records and won an Olympic gold medal.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, <b>oxandrolone,</b> and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{anabolic}} steroids, <b>oxandrolone</b> may worsen hypercalcemia {{by increasing}} osteolytic bone resorption. When taken by pregnant women, <b>oxandrolone</b> may have unintended effects such as masculinization on the fetus.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike some AAS, <b>oxandrolone</b> {{does not}} {{generally}} cause gynecomastia {{because it is}} not aromatized into estrogenic metabolites. However, although no reports of gynecomastia were made in spite of widespread use, <b>oxandrolone</b> was reported in a publication in 1991 to have been associated with 33 cases of gynecomastia in adolescent boys treated with it for short stature. The gynecomastia developed during <b>oxandrolone</b> therapy in 19 of the boys and after the therapy was completed in 14 of the boys, and 10 of the boys had transient gynecomastia, while 23 had persistent gynecomastia that necessitated mastectomy. Though transient gynecomastia is a natural and common occurrence in pubertal boys, the gynecomastia associated with <b>oxandrolone</b> was of a late/delayed onset and was persistent in a high percentage of the cases. As such, the researchers stated, [...] "although <b>oxandrolone</b> cannot be implicated as stimulatory in gynecomastia", a possible relationship should be considered in clinicians using <b>oxandrolone</b> in adolescents for growth stimulation.|$|E
50|$|Children with {{idiopathic}} short stature or Turner syndrome {{are given}} doses of <b>oxandrolone</b> far smaller than those given to burn patients. Researchers have chosen dose ranges {{for children with}} great care to minimize the likelihood of virilization and premature maturation. Most adults treated with <b>oxandrolone</b> receive moderate doses. Bodybuilders often take doses much higher than these. <b>Oxandrolone</b> is generally administered at least once daily.|$|E
50|$|Uniquely among 17α-alkylated AAS, <b>oxandrolone</b> shows {{little to}} no {{hepatotoxicity}}, even at high doses. No cases of severe hepatotoxicity have been singularly attributed to <b>oxandrolone.</b> However, elevated liver enzymes have been observed in a minority of patients, particularly with high doses and/or prolonged treatment, although they return to normal ranges following discontinuation. In any case, <b>oxandrolone</b> may be among the safest 17α-alkylated AAS in terms of hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxandrolone</b> is {{well-established}} as a {{safe treatment}} for patients recovering from severe burns. Medical research has also established oxandrolone's efficacy in aiding the development of girls with Turner syndrome. Although <b>oxandrolone</b> has long been used to accelerate growth in children with idiopathic short stature, {{it is unlikely to}} increase adult height, and in some cases may even decrease it. <b>Oxandrolone</b> has, therefore, largely been replaced by growth hormone for this use.|$|E
50|$|Women who are {{administered}} <b>oxandrolone</b> may experience virilization, irreversible development of masculine {{features such as}} voice deepening, hirsutism, menstruation abnormalities, male-pattern hair loss, and clitoral enlargement. <b>Oxandrolone</b> may disrupt growth in children, reducing their adult height. Because of these side effects, doses given to women and children are chosen carefully and patients are usually monitored for virilization and growth abnormalities. Like other androgens, <b>oxandrolone</b> can cause or worsen acne and priapism (unwanted or prolonged erections). <b>Oxandrolone</b> can also reduce males' fertility, another side effect common among androgens. In an attempt {{to compensate for the}} exogenous increase in androgens, the body may reduce testosterone production via testicular atrophy and inhibition of gonadotropic activity.|$|E

5000|$|Many bodybuilders {{and athletes}} use <b>oxandrolone</b> for its muscle-building properties.
