Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 993 patients with asymptomatic HIV infection and CD 4 + cell counts above 400 per cubic millimeter were randomly assigned to receive zidovudine (500 mg twice daily) or placebo for three years.

40|$|The authors used multivariate repeated-measures {{transition}} {{models to}} identify {{risk factors for}} two oral lesions related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) —candidiasis and hairy leukoplakia—in 152 HIV-infected blood transfusion recipients and hemophiliacs. Subjects were examined for occurrences of these lesions every 6 months from July 1985 through March 1993, yielding 1, 076 study visits. It was found that, after adjustment for the CD 4 : CD 8 T-lymphocyte ratio, patients {{with a history of}} candidiasis in the previous 18 months were at high risk of lesion recurrence. This risk increased with the number of prior episodes and with the recency of the episode(s). A history of <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> was less predictive of persistence of that lesion after adjustment for significant risk factors (including candidiasis and use of antifungal agents at the current examination, a low CD 4 : CD 8 cell ratio, and age less than 40 years). The authors also found a high coprevalence of candidiasis and <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> in these subjects. These results suggest that HIV-infected patients with oral candidiasis should be carefully monitored for subsequent episodes over the next 12 - 18 months, and patients with either <b>oral</b> candidiasis or <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> and a low CD 4 : CD 8 cell ratio should be carefully examined for the other type of lesion as well.

40|$|The {{impaired}} host {{defense system}} in HIV infection impacts the oral and gastrointestinal microbiota and associated opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral treatment {{is predicted to}} partially restore host defenses and decrease the oral manifestation of HIV/AIDS. Well-designed longitudinal {{studies are needed to}} better understand the interactions of soluble host defense proteins with bacteria and virus in HIV/AIDS. "Crosstalk" was designed as a longitudinal study of host responses along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and interactions between defense molecules and bacteria in HIV infection and subsequent therapy. The clinical core formed the infrastructure {{for the study of the}} interactions between the proteome, microbiome and innate immune system. The core recruited and retained study subjects, scheduled visits, obtained demographic and medical data, assessed oral health status, collected samples, and guided analysis of the hypotheses. This manuscript presents a well-designed clinical core that may serve as a model for studies that combine clinical and laboratory data. Crosstalk was a case-control longitudinal clinical study an initial planned enrollment of 170 subjects. HIV+ antiretroviral naïve subjects were followed for 9 visits over 96 weeks and HIV uninfected subjects for 3 visits over 24 weeks. Clinical prevalence of oral mucosal lesions, dental caries and periodontal disease were assessed. During the study, 116 subjects (47 HIV+, 69 HIV-) were enrolled. Cohorts of HIV+ and HIV- were demographically similar except for a larger proportion of women in the HIV- group.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{diagnosis}} oral lesions related to HIV infection in individuals followed in the General Hospital of the School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The presence of oral lesions was correlated with gender, age, smoking habit, levels of CD 4 lymphocytes, HIV load, time of HIV seropositivity, AIDS condition, use of removable dental prosthesis, and use of HAART. Materials and Methods: 340 HIV infected individuals were selected for this study, all participants of the study were examined by only one practiced dentist which performed anamnesis, peribuccal and oral examination. Results: Oral lesions were observed in 113 of 340 (33. 2 %) HIV infected individuals. These oral lesions included: oral candidiasis (17. 7 %) of pseudomembranous (10. 8 %) and of erythematous types (6. 9 %), angular cheilitis (13. 9 %), <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> (11. 8 %), and oral ulcers (2. 1 %). Oral candidiasis lesions were more frequently observed in women (p. 033). Smoking addict participants presented a high frequency of tongue <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> (p. 038) and a reduced frequency of oral ulcers (p. 018). <b>Hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> and pseudomembranous candidiasis were inversely correlated to CD 4 + L levels and directly correlated with HIV load, behaving as immune depression markers. <b>Hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> and pseudomembranous candidiasis also showed an inverse correlation with HAART use (p <. 0001).

50|$|The {{involvement}} of viruses {{in the formation}} of some oral white lesions is well established, e.g. Epstein-Barr virus in <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> (which is not a true leukoplakia). Human papilloma virus (HPV), especially HPV 16 and 18, is sometimes found in areas of leukoplakia, however since this virus can be coincidentally found on normal, healthy mucosal surfaces in the mouth, it is unknown if this virus is involved in the development of some leukoplakias. In vitro experimentation has demonstrated that HPV 16 is capable of inducing dysplastic changes in previously normal squamous epithelium.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually {{made on the}} clinical appearance alone, and biopsy is not usually indicated. The histologic appearance is one of marked hyperparakeratosis producing a ragged surface with many projections of keratin. Typically there is superficial colonization by bacteria. There may be vacuolated cells in the upper portion of the prickle cell layer. There is a similarity between this appearance and that of hairy leukoplakia, linea alba and leukoedema. In people with human immunodeficiency virus, who are at higher risk of <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia,</b> a tissue biopsy {{may be required to}} differentiate between this and frictional keratosis from cheek and tongue chewing.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} can typically be {{made from}} the clinical appearance alone, but not always. As candidiasis can be variable in appearance, and present with white, red or combined white and red lesions, the differential diagnosis can be extensive. In pseudomembraneous candidiasis, the membranous slough can be wiped away to reveal an erythematous surface underneath. This is helpful in distinguishing pseudomembraneous candidiasis from other white lesions in the mouth that cannot be wiped away, such as lichen planus, <b>oral</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia.</b> Erythematous candidiasis can mimic geographic tongue. Erythematous candidiasis usually has a diffuse border that helps distinguish it from erythroplakia, which normally has a sharply defined border.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Solid organ {{transplant}} (SOT) and {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant (HSCT) recipients {{are at risk of}} several diseases, principally attributable to immunosuppression. This global overview of SOT/HSCT-associated orofacial diseases is aimed at providing a practical instrument for the oral healthcare management of SOT/HSCT recipients. Methods: Literature search was made through MEDLINE. The associations between orofacial diseases and SOT/HSCT were assessed using observational studies and case series and were classified into association, no association, and unclear association. Results: Lip/oral cancers, drug-induced gingival overgrowth (DIGO), infections, including <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> and, less frequently, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) and oral lichenoid lesions of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), were associated with SOT. Lip/oral cancers, GVHD, mucositis, DIGO, infections and, less frequently, PTLDs were associated with HSCT. Associations of orofacial granulomatosis-like lesions and oral mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma with SOT, and of pyogenic granuloma and <b>hairy</b> <b>leukoplakia</b> with HSCT were unclear. Periodontal disease and dental caries were not associated with SOT/HSCT. For none of the local treatments was there a strong evidence of effectiveness.
