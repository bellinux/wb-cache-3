40|$|Abstract — Fuzzy queries {{addressed}} to a relational {{database management system}} {{are based on the}} expression of user preferences which leads to obtain more appropriate answers. Fuzzy set theory provides powerful tools to define such conditions (fuzzy conditions). In this context, it is possible to consider fuzzy bipolar conditions which are made of two fuzzy sets to describe user's preferences: i) a fuzzy constraint to represent a mandatory requirement, ii) a fuzzy wish to represent an <b>optional</b> <b>requirement.</b> A Fuzzy constraint is mandatory {{in the sense that it}} must be fulfilled (and it can be used to discard elements). A fuzzy wish is optional since it cannot be used to discard elements (but its satisfaction brings a bonification). This paper is devoted to the aggregation of fuzzy bipolar conditions and to the definition of extended norms and co-norms...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a {{mathematical}} model which can be easily used by the strategic managers of any organisation that initiates a virtual enterprise in Romania. Therefore, the first step is to identify the main characteristics a potential partner in such a specific supply chain must have. These characteristics can vary depending on the specific of the company and its position in the chain of the virtual enterprise. Some of these characteristics are mandatory <b>requirements,</b> some are <b>optional</b> <b>requirements.</b> We strongly advice that the mandatory requirements are observed, even when the process of gathering these data and/or information proves to be difficult. The <b>optional</b> <b>requirements</b> mentioned in the model provide a general framework as to what should be expected from a potential partner and can be changed according to the particular needs. These requirements are then inserted into a mathematical model, adaptable, flexible, customizable. The model is adaptable because it allows to insert certain issues of interest and to eliminate the unnecessary or irrelevant ones, it is flexible due to the possibility to change weights according to the relative importance of each feature and it is customizable since is based on questionnaires which are designed by each agent company, according to its specific needs. This model is based on actual observation of the Romanian market. ...|$|R

The design of the shaper is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, where response time and robustness,expressed in terms of residual vibrations, are the main objectives. As a part of the optimization formulation, common requirements for input shapers such as non-decreasing step response and unity steady state gain are considered in the design. Moreover, additional <b>optional</b> <b>requirements,</b> such as smoothness of a step response, jerk and even jounce limits can be added to optimization procedure. The resulting problem can be solved using convex optimization techniques. Several illustrative examples are presented in comparison with the classical input shaper.

Can it {{stand a chance against}} the wide range of hi-tech products that industrial research creates at the cost of large investments? In the current global financial crisis, wooden constructions are quickly gaining reputation not only for their reliability. An increased ecological awareness and environmental concern is the main reason for this growing trend but, aside that, we have also the perception of quality given by embedded technologies typical of this type of buildings. Use of low emission materials and energy efficiency are no more <b>optional</b> <b>requirements</b> and wooden technology can offer them both {{at a fraction of the}} price. Greater use of wood in construction can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by stimulating the expansion of forests and by reducing requirements for fossil fuel-intensive products.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} {{is to establish a}} set of minimum and <b>optional</b> <b>requirements</b> for the implementation of Control Authority (CA) organizations within and among the Agencies participating in the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). By satisfying these requirements, the resultant cooperating set of CA organizations will produce a global CA service supporting information transfer with digital data under the Standard Formatted Data Unit (SFDU) concept. This service is primarily accomplished through the registration, permanent archiving, and dissemination of metadata in the form of Metadata Objects (MDO) that assist in the interpretation of data objects received in SFDU form. This Recommendation addresses the responsibilities, services, and interface protocols for a hierarchy of CA organizations. The top level, consisting of the CCSDS Secretariat and its operational agent, is unique and primarily provides a global coordination function. The lower levels are Agency CA organizations that have primary responsibility for the registration, archiving, and dissemination of MDOs. As experience is gained and technology evolves, the CA Procedures will be extended to include enhanced services and their supporting protocols. In particular, it is anticipated that eventually CA organizations will be linked via networks on a global basis, and will provide requestors with online automated access to CA services. While this Recommendation does not preclude such operations, it also does not recommend the specific protocols to be used to ensure global compatibility of these services. These recommendations will be generated as experience is gained...|$|R

SDN is an architectural paradigm that separates the control plane of a networking device (e. g., a switch / router) from its data plane, making it feasible to control, monitor, and manage a network from a centralized node (the SDN controller). However, today there exists many SDN controllers including POX, FloodLight, and OpenDaylight. The question is, which of the controllers is to be selected and used? To find out {{the answer to this}} question, a decision making template is proposed in this paper to help researchers choose the SDN controller that best fits their needs. The method works as follow s; first, several existing open-source controllers are analyzed to collect their properties. For selecting the suitable controller based on the derived requirements (for example, a Java interface must be provided by the controller), a matching mechanism is used to compare the properties of the controllers with the requirements. Additionally, for selecting the best controller based on <b>optional</b> <b>requirements</b> (for example, GUI will be extremely preferred over the age of the controller), a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method named Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been adapted by a monotonic interpolation / extrapolation mechanism which maps the values of the properties to a value in a pre-defined scale.
