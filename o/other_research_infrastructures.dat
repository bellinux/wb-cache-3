40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the past few years in the development of recommendations, policies, and procedures for creating and promoting citations to data sets, software, and <b>other</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> like computing facilities. Open questions remain, however, about the extent to which referencing practices of authors of scholarly publications are changing in ways desired by these initiatives. This paper uses four focused case studies to evaluate whether research infrastructures are being increasingly identified and referenced in the research literature via persistent citable identifiers. The findings of the case studies show that references to such resources are increasing, but that the patterns of these increases are variable. In addition, the study suggests that citation practices for data sets may change more slowly than citation practices for software and research facilities, due to the inertia of existing practices for referencing the use of data. Similarly, existing practices for acknowledging computing support may slow the adoption of formal citations for computing resources...|$|E

In parallel, individual researchers from the chemical, biological and biomedical communities expressed the need for tools that are more easily discoverable, better documented and affording a deeper comprehension {{of the quality of the}} underlying experimental data than currently available. In addition, the research community requested for improved reuse of structural data in complex scenarios such as modelling of biochemical events or in the interpretation of biological and functional information.

40|$|Sharing {{social media}} {{research}} datasets allows for reproducibility and peer-review, {{but it is}} very often difficult or even impossible to achieve due to legal restrictions and can also be ethically questionable. What is more, research data repositories and <b>other</b> <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>research</b> support institutions are only starting to target social media researchers. In this paper, we present a practical solution to sharing social media data {{with the help of a}} social science data archive. Our aim is to contribute to the effort of enhancing comparability and reproducibility in social media research by taking some first steps towards setting standards for sustainable data archiving. We present a showcase for sharing social media data with the example of a big dataset containing geotagged tweets (several months of continued geotagged tweets from the United States from 2014 and 2015; nearly half a billion tweets in total) through a research data archive. We provide a general background to the process of long-term archiving of research data. After some consideration of the current obstacles for sharing and archiving social media data, we present our solution of archiving the specific dataset of geotagged tweets at the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences, a publicly funded German data archive for secure and long-term archiving of social science data. We archived and documented tweet IDs and additional information to improve reproducibility of the initial research while also attending to ethical and legal considerations, and taking into account Twitter’s terms of service in particular...|$|R

40|$|The {{vision of}} ISBE is to enable Life Scientists from all sectors across Europe to tackle complex {{biological}} problems from a systems perspective. Training of scientists, at all levels, in all relevant fields of Systems Biology, {{is regarded as}} an essential prerequisite to implement Systems Biology approaches on a broad scale throughout Europe. This will require a major cultural change in training in the Life Sciences {{in order to develop}} the integrated approach required to generate the skilled work force necessary to exploit Systems Biology to its full potential. With this in mind, ISBE has hosted two workshops jointly with ERASysAPP to consider these issues in detail and to develop a core curriculum for Systems Biology which is described in WP 10 Deliverable 10. 2 (An ISBE document which defines a core curriculum for Systems Biology). The aim of this report (Deliverable 10. 3) is to describe potential mechanisms for the dissemination and implementation of this core curriculum. The need for trained staff to manage and operate European research infrastructures has also been identified as a key issue for the effective running and use of these infrastructures.

40|$|Stewardship of data, models, and {{processes}} produced within ISBE {{will be a}} vital crosscutting component of operations, and will ensure the availability, usability, longevity, and provenance of data and models. To do this ISBE must establish standardisation, curation and cataloguing tools and practices, to ensure that ISBE contributors and users can produce, retain, maintain and exchange data that is (re-) usable for ISBE modelling and interoperable with <b>other</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructures.</b> The value of stewardship is universally recognised but often more in principle than action: some £ 3 billion of public money is invested annually in research in the UK alone, yet the research data resulting from this considerable investment are seldom as visible as they might be. The German Research Foundation (DFG) estimates that 80 - 90 % of all research data is never shared with other researchers. These results are never published in a scientific journal and often hidden in a drawer in the laboratories. Thus, a majority of research data is lost because of un-sustained storage and lack of sharing of these data. The preservation and sharing of digital materials so others can effectively reuse them maximises the impact of research inspires confidence among the research councils and funding bodies that invest in the work. To systematically examine ISBE’s capability to support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data, model and SOP management we devised: (a) a User and Sector Stakeholder Analysis; and (b) an Asset Management Capability Framework. ISBE Research Infrastructure will {{be made up of}} distributed resources and services at two levels: 	Specialist public archives managed for the international community by national or pan-national providers that are: (a) asset-specific datasets; (b) public tools; (c) catalogues of datasets and tools. Providers may be aligned with nSBCs to contribute those resources/services to the ISBE Infrastructure or they may be part of another RI (e. g. ELIXIR) and their provision to the ISBE infrastructure contributed through MoUs and Service Level Agreements.

40|$|European e-Infrastructure {{projects}} are increasingly turning to Semantic Web[1] (SemWeb) technologies to address data integration challenges. This approach {{is proving to}} be a solution to some of the emerging challenges in the life sciences. The BioMedBridges semantic web pilot spans deliverables 4. 4, 4. 6, 4. 7, and 4. 8; its goal is to test the suitability of a semantic web approach to the task of integrating research data and to report on our experience of running an RDF-based platform integrating multiple data resources. In order to leverage experience where it exists and minimise the risks inherent in novel technology projects, a three-stage delivery was chosen for the pilot. As summarised below, these three stages are reported in separate deliverables. This deliverable D 4. 8 reports on the strategy, implementation and lessons learned for the semantic web pilots for BioMedBridges. By following this schedule and aligning partner-specific roadmaps to the blueprint delivered in Phase I (D 4. 4), the pilot projects were developed synchronously, allowing knowledge to be shared efficiently (Phases 2 - 3 : D 4. 6 - 4. 8). This enabled infrastructures to collaborate effectively and address common issues as they arose. In support of this effort, a knowledge-exchange workshop ran on the 29 - 30 April 2014 at TMF, Berlin, Germany. The programme and course materials are available at BioMedBridges website[2] and can be found in D 4. 7 Appendix 2 (‘Resources’), item 3 (‘SWAT 4 LS SemWeb training materials’). In December 2013 and December 2014, at SWAT 4 LS[3] and in May 2015 at an industry workshop, tutorials were delivered demonstrating the queries and analyses the RDF platform makes possible. A training course at the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester in December 2014 delivered a summary of the practicalities of working with and running an RDF platform, which summarised the technological approach and technology experience. All of the SemWeb pilot work was informed by the work of WP 3, with respect to the choice and use of ontologies, as well as provision and re-use of identifiers, reflecting the application of standards derived from the use case work packages (e. g. WP 7 and WP 10). BioMedBridges played a major role at the CRI (Clinical Research Informatics) Day organised by ECRIN: "First CRI Solutions Day" (26 - 27 May 2014 at Heinrich-Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany). The presentation about BioMedBridges (S. Suhr) was accompanied by presentations of software tools and hands-on sessions with their developers. Tools developed or employed in BioMedBridges (BBMRI Catalogue, CTIM, tranSMART, MOLGENIS / BiobankConnect, XNAT) and the approaches for data sharing of BioMedBridges could be compared with those of many <b>other</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> and EU projects, such as EATRIS, BBMRI, ECRIN, BioSHaRE, TRANSFoRm, EHR 4 CR, and p-medicine. The first impression of participants at the CRI Solutions Day was that EU projects often seem to cope with similar problems and have developed similar solutions. For example, all domains struggle with the same rigid conditions for data protection and the challenge of semantic interoperability. It was suggested that it might be better to bring projects together and to work jointly on software solutions to common problems. Especially in the area of semantic interoperability and legally compliant data sharing, BioMedBridges has developed generic solutions that may be of help for other projects. A workshop on translational research infrastructure including tools like XNAT, tranSMART, MOLGENIS, OpenClinica and Galaxy and the interfaces between them, co-organised by Dutch representatives of BBMRI, EuroBioImaging, and EATRIS, was held at the OpenBridges symposium (see section 3. 2. 1. 2, Pilots 1 through 3). Materials such as presentations, documentation on discussions relating to the OpenClinica-tranSMART and tranSMART-Galaxy connections, as well as XNAT at the Dutch DTL Programmers Meeting are available elsewhere[4]. Various other outreach and dissemination activities have taken place during the course of BioMedBridges WP 4, and are detailed within this report, in the relevant sections. While many of the most refined pilots (below) are centred on the use of RDF, {{it is not the only}} appropriate solution for data integration; our experience indicated that certain kinds of data are better suited to different distribution and integration mechanisms. Therefore, this report covers an array of solutions that achieve integration, including RDF-based, as well as those that provide integration points for future efforts; D 4. 6 included both RDF-based and pilots using alternative methodologies, D 4. 7 was targeted specifically at judging the suitability and scalability of a purely RDF-centric data integration solution, with other deliverables providing various interfaces to data (REST, widgets, GUIs). Here we summarize our processes, products, and lessons learnt during the execution of this work package. We also describe the further work that has been conducted in the period intervening D 4. 6 and this report (D 4. 8), as well as detailing the sustainability of these pilot activities, and lessons learnt throughout the entirety of WP 4.

The 2011 Roadmap will inform future decisions on where Australia should make strategic infrastructure investments to further develop its research capacity and improve research outcomes {{over the next five}} to ten years. The 2011 Roadmap will aim to consider new or emerging areas of research which may require different types of infrastructure in the future, and determine whether the current mix of Capability areas continues to meet researchers’ needs. The 2011 Roadmap will consider priorities in an international context, reflecting the international, collaborative nature of modern research and the important role of collaborative <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in bringing researchers together. Two previous Roadmaps for Australian <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> have been developed. The first was released in 2006 as part of the implementation of the National Collaborative <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> Strategy (NCRIS). The second, the 2008 Strategic Roadmap for Australian <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructure,</b> built on the 2006 Roadmap and presented a renewed view of the priority areas for strategic <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investments. The 2008 Roadmap formed the basis for the Australian Government’s 2009 Super Science Initiative. The 2011 Roadmap will once again focus on Capability areas, and as such it will not aim to identify specific items of infrastructure, or evaluate current funded facilities in each of the Capability areas. The 2011 Roadmap should identify areas where public investment in <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> will make a significant difference to Australia’s research and innovation outcomes. At the same time as this Roadmap is being developed, the National <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> Council (NRIC) is finalising a Strategic Framework for <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> Investment. It is intended the Strategic Framework will provide a high-level policy framework, which will include principles to guide the development of policy advice and the design of programs related to the funding of <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> by the Australian Government. Roadmapping has been identified in the Strategic Framework Discussion Paper as the most appropriate prioritisation mechanism for national, collaborative <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The strategic identification of Capability areas through a consultative roadmapping process was also validated in the report of the 2010 NCRIS Evaluation. The 2011 Roadmap is primarily concerned with medium to large-scale <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> However, any landmark infrastructure (typically involving an investment in excess of $ 100 million over five years from the Australian Government) requirements identified in this process will be noted.

How this can be achieved {{in the area of}} food and health has, to date, been unclear. Scope and approach This commentary paper presents examples of the types of food and health research facilities, resources and services available in Europe. Insights are provided on the challenge of identifying and classifying <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In addition, suggestions are made for the future direction of food and health <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Europe. These views are informed by the EuroDISH project, which mapped <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in four areas of food and health research: Determinants of dietary behaviour; Intake of foods/nutrients; Status and functional markers of nutritional health; Health and disease risk of foods/nutrients. Key findings and conclusion There is no objective measure to identify or classify <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> It is therefore, difficult to operationalise this term. EuroDISH demonstrated specific challenges with identifying the degree an organisation, project, network or national infrastructure could be considered a research infrastructure; and establishing the boundary of a <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (integral hard or soft facilities/resources/services). Nevertheless, there are opportunities to create dedicated food and health <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in Europe.

It will remain the most powerful accelerator {{in the world for}} at least two decades, and its full exploitation is the highest priority in the European Strategy for Particle Physics, adopted by the CERN Council and integrated into the ESFRI Roadmap. To extend its discovery potential, the LHC will need a major upgrade around 2020 to increase its luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of 10 beyond its design value. As a highly complex and optimized machine, such an upgrade of the LHC must be carefully studied and requires about 10 years to implement. The novel machine configuration, called High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will rely on a number of key innovative technologies, representing exceptional technological challenges, such as cutting-edge 13 tesla superconducting magnets, very compact and ultra-precise superconducting cavities for beam rotation, new technology for beam collimation and 300 -metre-long high-power superconducting links with zero energy dissipation. HL-LHC federates efforts and R&D of a large community towards the ambitious HL-LHC objectives and contributes establishing the European Research Area (ERA) as a focal point of global research cooperation and a leader in frontier knowledge and technologies. However, it relies on a strong participation from outside the (ERA), in particular leading US and Japanese laboratories, which will facilitate the implementation of the construction phase as a global project. The proposed governance model is tailored accordingly and may pave the way for the organization of <b>other</b> global <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R

The CReATIVE-B project - Coordination of Research e-Infrastructures Activities Toward an International Virtual Environment for Biodiversity – explored how cooperation and interoperability of large-scale <b>Research</b> <b>Infrastructures</b> across the globe could support the challenges of biodiversity and ecosystem research. A key outcome of the project is that the <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> agreed to continue cooperation {{after the end of}} the project to advance scientific progress in understanding and predicting the complexity of natural systems. By working together in implementing the recommendations in this Roadmap, the data and capabilities of the cooperating <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are better served to address the grand challenges for biodiversity and ecosystem scientists...|$|R

Nevertheless, <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are significantly involved in producing, documenting and archiving data; in the development of standards; and in social sciences data skills training. The edition under review, which was developed from a symposium with the Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences (FORS), aims at making <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and their services more visible, as well as highlight the necessity of their sustainable funding.

40|$|Data is {{the lifeblood}} of science. Scientists produce data and analyse data, and service {{providers}} including <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (and e-infrastructures) provide facilities for data production and/or storage, sharing and reuse. There is increasing pressure for <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to have a clear, forward-looking data strategy: from funders during the forming process of new <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> {{as a result of}} technical developments (“explosion” of data coming from new instrumentation), and from the open access/open data movements, where the scientific community, journal publishers, and policymakers push for increasing amounts of data to be made available via various repositories. This document describes the high-level issues that may influence the data strategy of <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> at various stages of development. The information is primarily targeted at <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> project managers (or equivalent) as communication and knowledge hubs. However, the information presented here may also be interesting for technical staff operating at the management level, and aid communication exchange and collaboration between the two groups. The points presented here result from the discussions during the BioMedBridges workshop on data strategies for <b>research</b> <b>infrastructures</b> held on 19 February 2015 at ESO headquarters in Garching, Germany as well as an earlier workshop with representatives of various e-infrastructures and the document “Principles of data management and sharing at European Research Infrastructures”...|$|R
