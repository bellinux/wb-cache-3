In July 2007 the Local Government Ombudsman published a report criticising Manchester City Council for serving an ASBO based purely on uncorroborated reports of nuisance by a neighbour, and the Council agreed to pay £2000 in compensation.|$|E
25|$|While it had {{organized}} {{roughly half of}} the porters within the company, the union was seemingly no closer to obtaining recognition {{than it had been}} in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.|$|E
25|$|The rules <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> driver can tow are {{different}} depending {{on when they}} passed their driving test.

5000|$|Thus in {{historical}} analysis with an argument from silence, {{the absence of}} a reference to an event or a document is used to cast doubt on the event not mentioned. While most historical approaches rely <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> author's works contain, an argument from silence relies <b>on</b> <b>what</b> the book or document does not contain. This approach thus uses <b>what</b> <b>an</b> author [...] "should have said" [...] rather than what is available in the author's extant writings.|$|R
25|$|The post-shooting {{investigation}} found no weapons on Diallo's body; the item {{he had pulled}} out of his jacket was not a gun, but a rectangular black wallet. The internal NYPD investigation ruled the officers had acted within policy, based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> reasonable police officer would {{have done in the}} same circumstances with the information they had. The Diallo shooting led to a review of police training policy and the use of full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets. On March 25, 1999, a Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. All four officers' bail were set at $100,000. On December 16, an appellate court ordered a change of venue to Albany, New York, stating that pretrial publicity had made a fair trial in New York City impossible. On February 25, 2000, after two days of deliberation, a jury in Albany acquitted the officers of all charges. Officer Kenneth Boss had been previously involved in an incident where an unarmed man was shot. Another black man, 22-year-old Patrick Bailey, died after Boss shot him on October 31, 1997. As of 2012, Boss is the only remaining officer working for the NYPD. After his acquittal, Boss was disarmed and reassigned to desk duty. In October 2012, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly restored Boss' ability to carry a firearm against the protests of Diallo's family. On December 17, 2015, Kenneth Boss, received a promotion to the rank of sergeant despite objections from the victim’s mother and civil rights activists. Boss was promoted in accordance to police policy, which is not subject to review by top department officials.|$|E

Robert Canning of IGN said that the episode [...] "failed to deliver the comic gold we were hoping for." [...] Canning had hoped that Tracy's storyline would be a [...] "subtle, fairly straightforward plot", in contrast to the wackiness the series had a reputation for, but found it unfunny. The reviewer did not enjoy the appearances of Dratch and Winters, and felt Conan O'Brien was not used to his full potential. Canning rated the episode 5 out of 10.|$|E
