5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, the Rite of Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry.

During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm. The modern order now boasts up to 99 degrees, not all of which actually worked.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 1828, the {{expedition}} boarded the ship Eglé at Toulon and set sail for Egypt and {{they arrived in}} Alexandria on August 18.

Champollion, Rosselini and Lenormant met with the Pasha on August 24, and he immediately gave his permission. However, {{after more than a}} week of waiting for the permissions, Champollion suspected that Drovetti was working against him and took a complaint to the French consulate. The complaint worked and soon the pasha provided the expedition with a large river boat. The expedition bought a small boat for five persons. Champollion named them the Isis and the Athyr after Egyptian goddesses. On September 19, they arrived in Cairo, where they stayed until October 1 when they left for the desert sites <b>of</b> <b>Memphis,</b> Saqqara and Giza.|$|E
5|$|Wax was {{particularly}} involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 by a group <b>of</b> <b>Memphis</b> city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E
