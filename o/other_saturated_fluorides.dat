40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the extent and confirm the cause of an August 1993 outbreak of acute fluoride poisoning in a small Mississippi community, thought to result from excess fluoride in the public water supply. METHODS: State health department investigators interviewed patrons of a restaurant where the outbreak first became manifest and obtained blood and urine samples for measurement of fluoride levels. State health department staff conducted a random sample telephone survey of community households. Public health environmentalists obtained water and ice samples from the restaurant and tap water samples from a household close {{to one of the}} town's water treatment plant for analysis. Health department investigators and town water department officials inspected the fluoridation system at the town's main water treatment plant. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 62 restaurant patrons reported acute gastrointestinal illness over a 24 -hour period. Twenty of 61 households that used the community water supply reported one or more residents with acute gastrointestinal illness over a four-day period, compared with 3 of 13 households that did not use the community water supply. Restaurant water and ice samples contained more than 40 milligrams of fluoride per liter (mg/L), more than 20 times the recommended limit, and a tap water sample from a house located near the main treatment plant contained 200 mg/l of fluoride. An investigation determined that a faulty feed pump at one of the town's two treatment plants had allowed <b>saturated</b> <b>fluoride</b> solution to siphon from the saturator tank into the ground reservoir and that a large bolus of this overfluoridated water had been pumped accidentally into the town system.

40|$|A {{saturated}} core {{fault current}} limiter (FCL) is {{a device that}} is designed to limit the fault currents in electrical energy networks and consequently, protect existing network equipment from damage. Due to complex nonlinear magnetic properties, the performance of saturated core FCLs has largely been characterized through experimentation and finite-element analysis simulations. Although both of these techniques are quite accurate, they are time consuming and do not describe the behavior of FCLs in actual electrical networks. This has led to an increasing demand for an accurate analytical model that is suitable for transient network analyses. This paper presents the development of an analytical model of a single-phase open-core FCL, which accurately describes the nonlinear magnetic properties of the FCL through a reduced reluctance approach.

40|$|AbstractAs {{environmental}} regulations continue to restrict chemical processing emissions, phosphate plant operators {{will eventually be}} required to neutralize fluoride waste materials. Most phosphate plants currently use direct contact barometric condensers with recirculating cooling pond water that is <b>saturated</b> with <b>fluoride</b> salts. Most of this fluoride is allowed to precipitate as the recirculating water cools in large cooling pond systems. When forced to treat fluoride contaminated water, phosphate producers typically use lime or limestone neutralization prior to discharging effluent. A better environmental alternative is to use scrubbers to remove fluorides as fluosilicic acid prior to condensing the vapors in barometric condensers. If a market cannot be found for the fluosilicic acid, it can then be neutralized with phosphate rock to produce a weak phosphoric acid. This technique is not currently used {{because it is not}} profitable.

In this work such a nonlinear PID controller with bounded torques for robot manipulators is proposed. This controller, unlike <b>other</b> <b>saturated</b> nonlinear PID controllers previously proposed, uses a single saturation for the three terms of the controller.

Assuming a ring-oscillator structure, the outputs of a VCO toggle between two discrete levels (V DD and GND) like a CMOS digital gate, enabling simple multibit quantization using D-flip-flops. Since only one VCO output phase transitions at a given sampling instant while all <b>others</b> <b>saturate</b> to the positive/negative supply, quantization is robust to flip-flop voltage offsets and metastability, and has guaranteed monotonicity. Furthermore, the VCO behaves as a CT integrator in that its output phase is proportional to the time integral of the applied control voltage. As long as it oscillates, the VCO output phase accumulates endlessly, implying that it is also an integrator with infinite DC gain. However, the nonlinearity in the VCO’s voltage-to-frequency (K v) transfer characteristic seriously limits the resolution of VCO-based ADCs (Fig. 9. 5. 1, top).

40|$|Dietary fat {{composition}} {{can interfere}} {{in the development}} of obesity due to the specific roles of some fatty acids that have different metabolic activities, which can alter both fat oxidation and deposition rates, resulting in changes in body weight and/or composition. High-fat diets in general are associated with hyperphagia, but the type of dietary fat seems to be more important since saturated fats are linked to a positive fat balance and omental adipose tissue accumulation when compared to other types of fat, while polyunsaturated fats, omega- 3 and omega- 6, seem to increase energy expenditure and decrease energy intake by specific mechanisms involving hormone-sensitive lipase, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &# 945; (PPAR&# 945;) and <b>others.</b> <b>Saturated</b> fat intake can also impair insulin sensitivity compared to omega- 3 fat, which has the opposite effect due to alterations in cell membranes. Obesity is also associated with impaired mitochondrial function. Fat excess favors the production of malonyl-CoA, which reduces GLUT 4 efficiency.

The reason for this remains to be established, {{although}} it appears that it must be related to inherent differences in the metabolism of the fatty acid. In the present study, we have looked at the metabolism of palmitic acid and stearic acid, in comparison with oleic acid, by cultured hamster hepatocytes. Stearic acid was taken up more slowly and was poorly incorporated into both cellular and secreted triacylglycerol. Despite this, stearic acid stimulated the synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerol to the same extent as the other fatty acids. Incorporation into cellular phospholipid was lower for oleic acid than for palmitic acid and stearic acid. Desaturation of stearic acid, to monounsaturated fatty acid, was found to be greater than that of palmitic acid. Oleic acid produced from stearic acid was incorporated into both triacylglycerol and phospholipid, representing 13 % and 6 % respectively of the total after a 4 h incubation.

We aimed at examining the association between serum fatty acids and melanoma risk by conducting a population-based case-control study in a northern Italy community. Methods. The percentage composition of 12 fatty acids was determined in 51 newly diagnosed melanoma patients and 51 age- and sex-matched population controls by extracting total lipids from serum samples using thin layer and gas chromatography. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk of melanoma associated with tertiles of percentage composition of each fatty acid as well as groupings including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Results. We found a slightly increased melanoma risk for stearic and arachidic acids proportion, with and without adjustment for potential confounders.

We also determined the equilibrium bilayer partitioning coefficient of CTL with 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) membranes containing 20 mol% of saturated SM analogs.

When CTL membrane partitioning was determined with fluid POPC bilayers containing 20 mol% of a saturated chain length SM analog, the highest affinity was seen with 16 : 0 -SM (both at 23 and 37 °C).

Reversible S-acylation involves the attachment of palmitate (C 16 : 0) or <b>other</b> <b>saturated</b> lipids to cysteines through a thioester linkage and was implicated in the regulation of signaling [12]. Here we show that transient S-acylation of Arabidopsis AtROP 6 takes place on two conserved G domain cysteine residues, C 21 and C 156. C 21 is relatively exposed and is accessible for modification, but C 156 is not, implying that its S-acylation involves a conformational change. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching beam-size analysis [13] shows that S-acylation of AtROP 6 regulates its membrane-association dynamics, and detergent-solubilization studies indicate that it regulates AtROP 6 association with lipid rafts. Site-specific acylation-deficient AtROP 6 mutants can bind and hydrolyze GTP but display compromised effects on polar cell growth, endocytic uptake of the tracer dye FM 4 - 64, and distribution of reactive oxygen species.
