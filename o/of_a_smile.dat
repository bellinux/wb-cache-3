25|$|The Charlottenburg version (260 × 226cm; 102⅓ × 89in) shows Napoleon {{in a red}} cloak {{mounted on}} a {{chestnut}} horse. The tack is simpler, lacking the martingale, and the girth is grey-blue. There are traces {{of snow on the}} ground. Napoleon's features are sunken with the faint hint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> The picture is signed L.DAVID YEAR IX.|$|E
25|$|The second Versailles version (267 × 230cm; 105 × 90½in) shows a {{black and}} white horse with {{complete}} tack but lacking the martingale. The girth is red. The cloak is orange-red, the collar is black, and the embroidery of the gauntlet is very simple and almost unnoticeable. The scarf tied around Napoleon's waist is light blue. The officer with the sabre is again masked by the tail of the horse. Napoleon's features are older, he has shorter hair, and—as in the Charlottenburg version—there is the faint trace <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> The embroidery and the style of the bicorne suggest that the picture was completed after 1804. The picture is not dated but is signed L.DAVID.|$|E
500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, the hint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first going {{to be involved in the}} editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. [...] "Toxic" [...] is Spears's most expensive music video to date, at a cost of $1 million.|$|E

500|$|McCann {{notes that}} Grant {{typically}} played [...] "wealthy privileged characters who {{never seemed to}} have any need to work {{in order to maintain}} their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle. He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes even close to mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done, by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E

A few days later, I encountered Haldeman. [...] "What happened to our understanding that my exit would be postponed for a few weeks?" [...] I asked.

2500|$|In this play, {{there are}} very few {{dialogue}} passages that are written without script directions (written in italics inside parentheses before the actual printed dialogue). Although it is common practice for playwrights to supply some interpretation of how the dialogue should be delivered, Albee supplies these directions quite liberally and quite specifically. For instance, in the opening scene, he directs Agnes’s first lines with these directions: “ (Speaks usually softly, with a tiny hint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on her face: not sardonic, not sad [...] [...] [...] wistful, maybe).” In a later line for Tobias, Albee directs the actor to deliver it in this way: (Very nice, but there is steel underneath). For one of Claire’s lines, Albee suggests that the actor speak, “ (to Agnes’ back, a rehearsed speech, gone through but hated)”.|$|E

2500|$|Vishniac's {{photographs}} from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished. His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: [...] "There is barely a hint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> {{on any of the}} faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient casement windows and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners." [...] Gene Thornton, writer for The New York Times, called them [...] "somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter".|$|E

25|$|Cheater {{recognition}} {{is closely related}} to the recognition of specific emotions. Bell et al. argue for the existence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emotional incongruity effect. Memory is better for the face <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> cheater than <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> cooperator, because the incongruity captures the attention of the participant. If the emotion violates the expectancy then it is much better remembered. Furthermore, negative information is much better remembered whether it violates expectancies or not. Negative emotions have a strong effect on source memory due to the presence of threatening stimuli.|$|R
