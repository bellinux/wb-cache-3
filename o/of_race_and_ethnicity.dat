25|$|A small {{percentage}} of Nevada's population lives in rural areas. The culture of these places differs significantly from the major metropolitan areas. People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where {{the vast majority of}} the population was born in another state. The rural population is also less diverse in terms <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity.</b> Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent. Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} occurs {{beyond the}} spheres <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> {{in the identification}} of geographic origin. Indeed, evidence suggests that listeners may successfully categorize speakers based upon dialect. Clopper and Pisoni (2003) found that naïve (or inexperienced) listeners could successfully categorize speakers as hailing from New England, the South, or the West, but had greater difficulty discerning geographic origin when a larger number of dialects were provided: New England, North, North Midland, South Midland, South, West, New York City, or Army Brat. Listeners were only able to identify speakers correctly 30% of the time. They also found evidence suggesting that residential history of the listener affected speaker categorization, and that listeners tended to use a small set of phonetic cues to make these distinctions.|$|E

40|$|Notions <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> <b>and</b> gender are so {{frequently}} essentialized {{precisely because they}} are such complex, messy, contingent, contradictory, and fragmentary concepts. As a result, representations <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> gender, <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> tend to mistake the wholeness of the representations for the wholeness of the racial, ethnic, or gendered subject. Just as <b>race,</b> gender, <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> are lived <b>and</b> experienced by comic book creators, so too are they imagined and constructed within the constraints of industry practices. This dissertation examines the representation <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> gender, <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> in comic books {{through the eyes of}} comic book producers; a relatively small segment of the U. S. entertainment industry consisting of men, women, and corporate entities that make their living imagining identities and telling tales of adventure and heroism. This dissertation is an intentional and, I will argue, necessary break from more traditional models of media and cultural studies that emphasize consumption, textual analysis, audience reception, and reading practices...|$|R
25|$|As {{enrollment}} increased, so did {{the ethnic}} diversity of the student body. By 1995, fully 30% of UCR students were members of non-Caucasian groups, the highest proportion of any campus in the UC system at the time. The 1997 implementation of Proposition 209 — which banned the use <b>of</b> <b>race</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnicity</b> as criteria for admissions, hiring, promotions and contracting by state agencies (including the University of California) — {{had the effect of}} further increasing ethnic diversity at UCR while reducing it at the most selective campuses in the system. By 2007, fully 69% of undergraduates were members of non-Caucasian groups. Faculty diversity statistics, however, remained relatively constant. 9.1% of UCR faculty were members of underrepresented minority groups in 1997, only 2% higher than the UC average. This percentage dropped to the UC average of 7.3% in 2002, but was back up to 9% in 2006, making it the third-most diverse faculty in the UC system behind Merced and Santa Cruz. Still, given the diversity of the student body and within the surrounding area, this relative lack of diversity at the faculty level remains controversial.|$|E
