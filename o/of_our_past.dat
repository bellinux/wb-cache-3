500|$|Scholar Andrea Loewenstein {{published}} the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes {{that they were}} [...] "exceptionally good pulp" [...] that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 {{had a tendency to}} reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. [...] "Since much <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>past</b> is so bitter, ... pretend away our most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states [...] "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, [...] "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is [...] "surprisingly... passionate, tender, and erotic".|$|E

500|$|The poem {{served as}} a sort of {{opposite}} to the popular idea that The Waste Land {{served as a}}n expression of disillusionment after World [...] War I, even though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. World War II itself has a direct mention in only a few of Eliot's writings. However, World War II does affect the poem, especially with the disruption caused by the war being reflected within the poem as a disruption of nature and heaven. The poem describes society in ways similar to The Waste Land, especially with its emphasis on death and dying. The place is connected to where Eliot's family originates, and, as such, is also the place where his family will symbolically end. In {{the second part of the}} poem, nature is experiencing disorder, and it is suggested that humans too may burn, and also that reason, knowledge, and science cannot save people. The errors <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>past</b> become the reasons for war and conflict and we need to become humble in order to escape the destruction. However, darkness consumes the rulers of the world and society. This is, in part, due to Adam's fall, and the resulting concept of original sin. Christ is our savior and we need to seek redemption to overcome our human failings. Eliot states that he has been involved with fighting for humanity and trying to help mankind learn what is important. Only through Christ is man able to be redeemed.|$|E

2500|$|Urechia's had {{conflicting}} {{attitudes on}} the cohabitation of Romanians and ethnic minorities. His Coliba Măriucăi, {{one of the}} first novels in Romanian literature to explore social problems from a critical perspective, and written just as slavery was being outlawed in Moldavia, he expresses sympathy for the persecuted Romani community. In contrast with this approach, the statements made by Urechia in his conflict with Lazăr Şăineanu show an antisemitic side to his Romanianism, which academic Michael Shafir rates as [...] "cultural" [...] and [...] "economic" [...] rather than [...] "racial". While debating Şăineanu's status in academia, Urechia claimed: [...] "A person foreign to our nation's fiber could never awaken in the mind and heart of the young generation the image <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>past</b> [...] How will that person recognize those pulsations in the historical life of Romanians, when he has nothing in common with [...] aspirations?" [...] Urechia was especially adverse to Şăineanu's study on the traditional references to Jews as [...] "Tatars" [...] and Uriaşi, as a reference to an Early Medieval presence of Khazars in present-day Romanian territories. He therefore publicly accused Şăineanu of making it seem that the Jews had a historical precedent over Romanians. Literary critic Laszlo Alexandru writes that Urechia's reading of the text was [...] "in bad faith", and his conclusions [...] "slanderous". In 1895, during the final Senate vote on Şăineanu's naturalization, Urechia gave an applauded speech in which he likened the linguist with the Trojan Horse, urging his fellow parliamentarians not to allow [...] "a foreigner into the Romanian citadel".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>past</b> records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release.

They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them.

2500|$|Having {{failed to}} perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony's only means {{with which he}} might [...] "write himself into Rome's {{imperial}} narrative and position himself at the birth of empire" [...] is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; [...] "once [...] understands his failed virtus, his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate Dido". Antony and Cleopatra {{can be read as}} a rewrite of Virgil's epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: [...] "If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>past</b> is Aeneas' rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the Roman Empire, than it is surely significant that Shakespeare's ... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back {{for the sake of his}} African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas". Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of [...] "occupying the... politically empowering place" [...] of the female sacrificial victim. The abundant imagery concerning his person—"of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame"—informs the view of some critics that the Roman [...] "figures Antony's body as queer, that is, as an open male body... not only 'bends' in devotion' but... bends over". In reciprocal contrast, [...] "in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals". While Caesar's empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra's is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally—indeed, [...] "she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough'd her, and she cropp'd" [...] (2.2.232–233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that [...] "as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play's action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility". Caesar says of her final deed, [...] "Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way" [...] (5.2.325–327).|$|E
2500|$|Because {{it had no}} intersections, the autobahn {{required}} {{a huge number of}} bridges and underpasses. These were initially purely utilitarian in design, but after inspecting the first completed stretch, Todt sought to give them a more unified and aesthetic appearance. Paul Bonatz, who was hired in 1934 to oversee bridge design on the Reichsautobahn, wrote a few months before that they should be as unnoticeable as possible, minimal in mass and in obstruction of view. Like the rest stops, they were also designed to reflect local building styles and materials. One exception that proved the rule was the bare steel bridges spanning the Dessauer Rennstrecke high-speed section, which expressed its high-tech purpose and also alluded to the Junkers aircraft company that was headquartered in Dessau. The relatively few large bridges were major design statements; Todt wrote in 1937 that they [...] "should not be [...] for 1940, nor yet for 2000, but... should extend their dominating presence, like the cathedrals <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>past,</b> into future millennia." [...] The first of these was the Mangfall Bridge at Weyarn, a girder bridge designed by German Bestelmeyer that spanned the valley on two double pylons of reinforced concrete. Built in 193436, this served as the model for several subsequent autobahn bridges, and a model of one of the huge pylons dominated the Reichsautobahn exhibit at the Gebt mir vier Jahre Zeit exhibition. Subsequently, the preferred style for the large bridges evolved away from this modern form toward viaducts derived from Roman bridges, which had a more imposing mass, allowed the reflection of regional building styles in their use of stone and brick, and embodied the Nazi claim to be the heirs to the great builders of ancient times. These included the Holledau Bridge by Georg Gsaenger (193738) and the bridges over the Saale at Hirschberg, Thuringia, and Jena; in 1938 Friedrich Tamm designed a huge imitation Roman viaduct for the Werra valley at Hedemünden. Another factor in this change in style was the shortage of steel caused by the policy of autarky and by rearmament and war; there was also a near failure of a continuously welded bridge, which had to be quietly reinforced and led to mistrust of steel construction. Many later bridges had a reinforced concrete core clad in stonework or brick. However, with the bridges the shift was never as complete as it was in other aspects of Reichsautobahn architecture: in 194041, along the Rhine, a stone bridge was under construction at Frankenthal {{and at the same time}} at Rodenkirchen in Cologne, an ultra-modern suspension bridge by Bonatz. In addition to the self-image of modernity, another reason for this was the enormous cost of stone construction in man-hours and in material; so much masonry construction was carried out in the Third Reich that shortages occurred. Hence many of the viaducts were in simplified, modernized form, for example the series at the Drackensteiner Hang by Paul Bonatz and the bridge over the Lahn valley at Limburg, by Bonatz and Gottwalt Schaper.|$|E
