40|$|Abstract. A {{successful}} {{approach to}} tracking is to <b>on-line</b> <b>learn</b> discriminative classifiers for the target objects. Although these trackingby-detection approaches are usually fast and accurate they easily drift {{in case of}} putative and self-enforced wrong updates. Recent work has shown that classifier-based trackers can be significantly stabilized by applying semi-supervised learning methods instead of supervised ones. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>on-line</b> multi-view <b>learning</b> algorithm based on random forests. The main idea of our approach is to incorporate multiview learning inside random forests and update each tree with individual label estimates for the unlabeled data. Our method is fast, easy to implement, benefits from parallel computing architectures and inherently exploits multiple views for learning from unlabeled data. In the tracking experiments, we outperform the state-of-the-art methods based on boosting and random forests. ...|$|R

As a second standard learning technique, the application of Sanger's rule for principal component analysis is investigated. In both scenarios the necessary process of student specialization may be delayed significantly due to underlying symmetries. ...|$|R

On-line technology is supporting our learning in many ways. There {{is a need to}} understand not only what framework could help conduct <b>on-line</b> problem-based <b>learning</b> but also the learner’s motivation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to draw up a framework of <b>on-line</b> problem-based <b>learning.</b> Based on literature review, a theoretical framework was identified. An implementation of this framework was conducted to verify the feasibility based upon the learner’s motivation. Motivation survey was conducted to explore the learner’s response. Concerning the framework of on-line PBL, the results of the evaluation conducted in this study implied that the feasibility existed. Pertaining to motivation, learners suggested that their motivations were from both the on-line social network and real world problem.

The key advantage of the presented method is a continuously updated model of the tracked target, used in the TL process, that allows to <b>on-line</b> <b>learn</b> the target visual appearance and consequently to improve the tracker accuracy.

The ability of <b>On-line</b> Dictionary <b>Learning</b> (ODL) to achieve sparse representation of an image is exploited to develop dictionaries for each class using edge-based feature.
