40|$|Purpose: Sustainability and {{the search}} for {{solutions}} that are both efficient and ecologically sound (eco-efficient) have become topics of great interest. However, companies seeking to develop supply chain solutions that are eco-efficient are often hampered by their ability to control the wider supply chain and they may need to draw on external support from logistics service providers (LSPs). This paper aims to explore the innovative strategies undertaken by LSPs in the eco-efficiency arena and the logistics and learning capabilities needed to achieve eco-efficiency in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The insights derived from a systematic literature review approach to identify the most relevant articles {{to be included in the}} analysis represented the starting point for building the authors empirical investigation, based on case studies with in-depth interviews to investigate the phenomenon under consideration and to explore trends and evolving paradigms. Findings: The systematic literature review enriches the existing literature by drawing on three bodies of knowledge, i. e. logistics service providers, eco-efficiency and logistics innovation, and putting them into a single framework. The findings from the interviews suggest that although LSPs are well placed to implement innovative initiatives for eco-efficiency there is a range of inhibitors that prevent major change programmes. Research limitations/implications: The research reported in this paper is exploratory and limited in its scope. It is based on in-depth interviews within six companies. However, it does provide a platform from which more detailed research may be conducted. Practical implications: The managerial implications arising from the research offer a wide range of current practices in sustainability, from which strategic and <b>operative</b> <b>directions</b> to compete can be derived. Originality/value: There is little existing literature that addresses the innovative strategies undertaken by LSPs in influencing and moving supply chains towards eco-efficiency and hence the present paper is meant to help fill this gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research station {{located at}} the {{geographic}} South Pole, is the most isolated, permanently inhabited human outpost on Earth. Medical care is provided to station personnel by a non-surgeon crew medical officer (CMO). During the winter-over period from February to October, the station is isolated, with no incoming or outgoing flights due to severe weather conditions. In late June, {{four months after the}} station had closed for the austral winter, a 31 year old meteorologist suffered a complete rupture of his patellar tendon while sliding done an embankment. An evacuation was deemed to be too risky to aircrews due to the extreme cold and darkness. A panel of physicians from Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Texas Medical Branch were able to assess the patient remotely via telemedicine and agreed that surgery was the only means to restore mobility and prevent long term disability. The lack of a surgical facility and a trained surgical team were overcome by conversion of the clinic treatment area, and intensive preparation of medical laypersons as surgical assistants. The non-surgeon CMO and CMO assistant at South Pole, were guided through the administration of spinal anesthetic, and the two-hour operative repair by medical consultants at Massachusetts General Hospital. Real-time video of the <b>operative</b> field, <b>directions</b> from the remote consultants and audio communication were provided by videoconferencing equipment, operative cameras, and high bandwidth satellite communications.

40|$|Biohazards are non-conventional {{threats that}} are very {{difficult}} to manage. This is due to difficulties in the identification of biological agents that are responsible for the onset of a disease, which can be bacteria, viruses, fungus or toxins. In Italy, the first response system to biohazards is provided by the National Fire Brigade (NFB) (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco - CNVVF). The aim of this work is to evaluate the procedures adopted by the NFB for the management of biohazards. This is done by comparing the statistics of NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 for potential biohazard events, and chemical and radioactive risks. A series of solutions is then proposed to improve the NFB’s national response system for biohazards. 1. INTRODUCTION Biohazards is a very complex subject which is not easily explored. In fact, while for chemical and radiological-nuclear hazards we can often refer to well-known data, it is not the same for risks in the biological context (Kaszeta, 2012). The reason for this lack of information is clear; biohazards have still not been completely understood. For example, the molecular mechanisms of cancer development have only recently been associated with viruses directly transmitted (Butel, 2000). Moreover, commercialised systems and instruments do not currently exist to identify several biological agents, and the ones that exist do not allow instant infield identification. Hence, it is often necessary to use complex laboratory instrumentation for certain and rapid determination. The use of laboratory techniques require extended periods of Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 34 Orlando Cenciarelli et. al time to get an answer. Additionally, the appropriate response is not always clear. In Italy, the first response system to biohazard events is provided by the National Fire Brigade (NFB) (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco - CNVVF). In the last decade, the NFB had to create a new division to operate in these “new risk scenarios” (we used the term “new” taking into account the classical background of infield operators). Following events involving biohazards, such as envelope and package contamination with anthrax spores (2001), and the potential spread of the avian influenza pandemic (2006)), circulars decrees were issued ad hoc by the Ministry of Interior (MOI) in order to provide <b>operative</b> <b>directions</b> for firefighters (MOI, 2001 a; MOI, 2006). Immediately afterwards, the NFB was equipped with modern facilities for the detection and management of biological agents (e. g. mobile laboratories, decontamination units, etc.). The aim of this work is to evaluate the procedures adopted by the NFB for the management of biohazard events. This is done by comparing the statistics of NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 for potential biohazard events, and chemical and radioactive risks. A series of solutions is then proposed to improve the NFB’s national response system for biohazard events. 2. THE NFB AND THE ITALIAN MANAGEMENT OF CBRN RISKS 2. 1 NFB’s Role in CBRN Events The NFB, a key element of the Italian civil protection system, is part of the Department of Fire, Rescue Service and Civil Defense, which operates under the MOI. It consists of approximately 35, 000 units. The NFB ensures urgent technical rescue, even in circumstances of unconventional risks. Its original primary objective is “to protect the safety of persons and things, by preventing and extinguishing fires and providing technical services in general, including those related to air defence” (MOI, 1941). The functions of the NFB was formally updated in MOI (2006), whereby the role of the NFB for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) events is also defined, particularly in terms of counteracting the risks arising from CBRN substances, including from possible non-conventional crimes aimed at damaging people or property, using adequate instruments and mobile units. Therefore, in order to respond effectively to CBRN events, the NFB requires suitable technical skills, resources and specialised equipments. 2. 2 NFB’s Response Levels NFB’s model response for CBRN events is described in the NFB intervention model (MOI, 2001 b). It is a mechanism of response that involves three different competency levels related to the complexity of the handling of the event. According to the intervention model, the local team (normally the closest one, the “basic team”) must reach the location of the event first. This team will then evaluate the situation, and determine the requirements for adequate means and support of other teams more qualified for that type of intervention. The intervention teams based on the level of qualification are as follows: Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 35 Evaluation of biohazard management of the Italian national fire brigade a) Basic team: Locally qualified to ensure the first intervention; b) Province specialists: Present in each provincial command; c) CBRN regional operative unit: Present in each command in the regional capital towns. Some of the regional commands are equipped with mobile analytical CBRN laboratories. It is specifically built for the CBRN unit of the NFB to carry out chemical, radioactive and biological sample analyses at the event site. Thus, they are able to obtain results in a shorter amount of time (Gulli et al., 2008). 2. 3 Scenarios and Type of Intervention In the case of biohazard events, the NFB refers to MOI (2001 b) to define the standard scenarios of intervention. Several possible scenarios of action are presented: a) Presence of suspicious material without clear traces of powder or liquid; b) Presence of suspicious material with clear traces of powder or liquid dispersed on surfaces but not spread within the environment; c) Presence of suspicious material with clear traces of powder dispersed on surfaces and also spread within the environment. Similarly, the types of events {{can be traced to the}} following three categories: a) Release (or risk of release) without (or no risk of) fire or explosion; b) Release (or risk of release) with (or risk of) fire or explosion; c) Recovery of hazardous substance (or suspect) without (or remote) risk of loss. 3. BIOHAZARDS Biohazards are linked to the exposure to biological agents and represent a potential danger for public health. Biohazards may arise from a variety of events involving biological agents, such as the natural diffusion; the accidental diffusion (e. g., spill from a biotechnology industry) or the intentional release into the environment (e. g., for terroristic attacks or war actions) (EC, 2012). Biological agents are microorganisms, including those which have been genetically modified, cell cultures and human endoparasites, which can cause any infection, allergy or toxicity (EC, 2000; MOL, 2008; DOL, 2012). According to EC (2000), biological agents can be classified into four risk groups depending on their level of risk of infection: Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 36 Orlando Cenciarelli et. al a) Group 1 : Agents that are unlikely to cause human disease. b) Group 2 : Agents that can cause human disease and might be a hazard to workers. They are unlikely to spread to the community, and there is usually effective prophylaxis or treatment available. c) Group 3 : Agents that can cause severe human disease and present a serious hazard to workers. They may present a risk of spreading to the community, but there is usually effective prophylaxis or treatment available. d) Group 4 : Agents that cause severe human disease and are a serious hazard to workers. They may present a high risk of spreading to the community, and there is usually no effective prophylaxis or treatment available. CDC (2012) further classifies the most important biological agents into three categories: a) Category A: Agents that can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person. They result in high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact. They might cause public panic and social disruption, and require special action for public health preparedness. b) Category B: Agents that are moderately easy to disseminate. They result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality, and require specific enhanced diagnostic capacity and disease surveillance. c) Category C: Emerging agents that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of their availability. They are easy to produce and disseminate. They are potentially linked to high morbidity and mortality rates, and major health impact. Biological agents can be further classified according to certain characteristics that define the hazard to health (NATO, 1996) : a) Infectivity: The aptitude of an agent to penetrate and multiply in the host; b) Pathogenicity: The ability of the agent to cause a disease after penetrating into the body; c) Transmissibility: The ability of the agent to be transmitted from an infected individual to a healthy one; d) Ability to neutralise: Means to have preventive tools and/or therapeutic purposes. Each biological agent can be transmitted through one or more ways. The transmission modes are mainly (La Placa, 2010) : a) Parenteral: Agents that are transmitted through body fluids or blood; b) Airway (by droplets) : Agents that are emitted by infected people, which can then be inhaled by surrounding people; c) Contact: Through which the agents present on the surface of the infected organism can infect another organism; Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 37 Evaluation of biohazard management of the Italian national fire brigade d) Oral-fecal route: Through objects, foods or other items contaminated with the feces of infected patients, or through sexual contact. 4. STATISTICS FOR NFB INTERVENTIONS FOR CHEMICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL RISKS, AND POTENTIAL BIOHAZARDS Since 2000, the NFB publishes on their website statistics of province command interventions for yearly periods (NFB, 2012). For this work, statistics regarding CBRN was collected for analysis. In particular, as shown in Table 1, the interventions involving chemical and radiological risks were examined. The total number of interventions involving chemical substances was obtained by adding all the events classified as “chemical substances involved” and “other inflammable and liquid and/or gaseous combustibles”, which includes “accident with a vehicle transporting dangerous substances”, “flipping over of a truck transporting dangerous substances” and “a gas leak”. The total number of interventions involving radioactive substances is reported in the official NFB statistics tout court and includes, among others, “recovery of radioactive lightning rod” and “recovery of radioactive substances”. Table 1 : NFB interventions in 2000 - 2010 involving chemical and radioactive substances. (Adapted from NFB (2012)). The estimation of the percentages of interventions involving chemical and radioactive substances over total interventions is calculated for yearly periods. The mean percentage is obtained by averaging the annual percentages calculated over total yearly interventions. While chemical and radiological risks are clearly evaluated in the NFB’s statistics, this is not done for biohazards, which is neither considered nor put into a table. For this reason, in order to conduct a statistical analysis, we considered the types of interventions that can be potentially associated to biohazards (natural, human related or voluntary) as the following: a) Saving of people; b) Recovery of dead people; c) Saving of animals; d) Recovery of dead animals; e) Transport of patients. Defence S&T Tech. Bull. 38 Orlando Cenciarelli et. al The non-specific category “general assistance services” was not considered. Following this notional evaluation, surprising results are obtained, as shown in Table 2. By taking the mean of the 2000 - 2010 data, we have a high percentage value (6. 61...|$|R
