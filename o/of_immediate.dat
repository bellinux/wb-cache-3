Radio Japan, which continued to extoll victory for Japan by never surrendering, had informed the Japanese of the destruction of Hiroshima by a single bomb.|$|E

5|$|UN forces {{began their}} final counteroffensive against the stalled North Korean forces on 15 August. Intense {{fighting}} around P'ohang-dong ensued {{for several days}} as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By 17 August, UN forces were able to push North Korean troops out of the Kyongju corridor and An'gang-ni, putting the supply road to Taegu out <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> danger. The NK 766th Independent Regiment—now down to 1,500 men—was forced to withdraw north to prevent being surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment.

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, {{whose job}} it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians, who would decide on the appropriate level of support {{and whether or not}} the applicants should be assigned to the workhouse.|$|E
30|$|With the {{development}} of LTCC technology, the comprehensive mechanical model for LTCC mining face has been greatly improved. Liu Changyou, et al. used site observation, finite element numerical calculation, and the analogous material modelling method to investigate the comprehensive mechanical properties <b>of</b> the <b>immediate</b> roof and their effect {{on the relationship between}} support and surrounding rock. By considering the immediate roof as a variable body, the characteristics of deformation and fracture <b>of</b> the <b>immediate</b> roof and the structural mechanical and stiffness properties <b>of</b> the <b>immediate</b> roof were studied. They proposed that the load <b>of</b> the <b>immediate</b> roof is regionalized, and provided a calculation method for the stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>immediate</b> roof. In addition, based on the stiffness characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>immediate</b> roof with a rectangle shape face, the immediate roof is divided into three categories as stiffness similar, zero stiffness and medium stiffness. When the immediate roof stiffness is zero, the support is in the status of a “given load” or a “limited load”. When the immediate roof is in a stiffness similar status, the support is in a “given deformation” status. When the immediate roof is in a medium stiffness status, the “P–△L” curve shows a typical double curve relationship. When the immediate roof is in a zero stiffness status, the rational resistance force of support is mainly determined by its effect on the stability of the face ends.|$|R

An estimated 30% <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries.

To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E

Though a few jeeps and trucks were found and commandeered, most of the retreat was carried out on foot. A few scattered artillery shells landed around the retreating force, but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them. By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> danger.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E

There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions, the problem would simply be ignored. The royal eyres, courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign. They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer, rather than coming from important local families, and they focused on generating revenue for the King. Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes. Unlike his father, Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown, and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to the end}} of the war on 15 August 1945, the Australian {{military}} was preparing to contribute forces to the invasion of Japan. Australia's participation in this operation would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces. It was planned to form a new 10thDivision from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the Commonwealth Corps with British, Canadian and New Zealand units. The corps' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps, and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of Honshū which was scheduled for March1946 under Operation Coronet. Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August1945 when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japanese field commanders subsequently surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre and Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai, several locations in Borneo, Timor, Wewak, Rabaul, Bougainville and Nauru. Following the surrender the Australian Army faced a number <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> operational and administrative issues, including the need to maintain security in the areas it occupied, the disarming and administration of surrendered Japanese forces in these areas, organising the return of approximately 177,000 soldiers (including prisoners of war) to Australia, the demobilisation and discharge of the bulk of the soldiers serving in the Army, and the raising of an occupation force for service in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia is the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces of the Republic of Croatia and appoints and relieves military commanders of duty, conforming to applicable legislation. Pursuant to decisions of the parliament, the president declares war and concludes peace. In cases <b>of</b> <b>immediate</b> threats to the independence, unity and existence of the state, the president may order the use of armed forces, even if no state of war is declared, provided that such an order is countersigned by the prime minister. During a state of war, the president may promulgate regulations with the force of law on the basis of, and within the scope of, authority obtained from the parliament. In such circumstances, the president may convene government cabinet meetings and preside over them. If the parliament is not in session, the president is authorized to regulate all matters required by the state of war through regulations carrying the force of law. In case of an immediate threat to the independence, unity and existence of the state, or if the governmental bodies are prevented from performing their constitutional duties regularly, the president may, at the proposal of the prime minister, issue regulations carrying the force of law. Such regulations must also be countersigned by the prime minister to become valid. The president is required to submit regulations that are promulgated thus to the parliament for approval as soon as the parliament may convene, otherwise the regulations become void. The president cooperates with the government directing operation of the Croatian security and intelligence system. The president and the prime minister jointly appoint heads of the security agencies, and the president may attend cabinet meetings, taking part in discussions held at such meetings.|$|E
