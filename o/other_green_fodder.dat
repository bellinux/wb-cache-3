25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no <b>other</b> <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> {{is available in}} the dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high nutritive value. Feeding of the leaves during winter when no <b>other</b> <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

The S 1 families were found different for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield per plant and number of leaves per plant. The values of coefficients of variation {{were found to be}} high for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> weight per plant (18. 34 %). These results indicate that there was more variability among S 1 lines for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> weight per plant. <b>Green</b> <b>fodder</b> weight was positively and highly significantly correlated with number of leaves per plant and plant height.

40|$|One hundred S 0 {{families}} selected out of 500 {{families on}} the basis of fresh shoot weight were further evaluated for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield under field conditions. The value of genetic coefficients of variation was found to be high (29. 97 %) for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield per plant suggesting greater variability for the said trait. <b>Green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield had positive and significant phenotypic correlated with number of leaves per plant and plant height. High relative expected genetic advance (18. 82 %) was found for <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield than <b>other</b> indicated traits. On the basis of genetic coefficient of variation, inter-relationships and relative expected genetic advance (REΔg %), it is concluded that <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> weight may be used as selection criteria while selecting superior S 1 families of maize. A selection intensity of 20 % from the families revealed an average of 424. 2 g compared to 234. 6 g <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield.

Plant height, number of leaves hill - 1, number of tillers hill - 1, <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield and seed yield were significantly differed due to different cultivar and leaf clipping height. Latishail produced the highest plant height, number of leaves hill - 1 and number of tillers hill - 1 at all growth stages where BR 10 showed the lowest among cultivars.

The experimental plot was located in Troubsko and Vatín, in the Czech Republic. Two varieties of Medicago sativa and one variety of Trifolium pratense were compared. <b>Green</b> <b>fodder</b> and subsequently produced silage reaching up to 23 % of dry matter were evaluated and prepared using a bio-enzymatic additive and a chemical additive. <b>Green</b> <b>fodder</b> of Medicago sativa was more contaminated by Enterococci than Trifolium pratense fodder.

Over the other treatments apart from 2 / 3 level of cutting seed yield of 3543 and 2072 kg ha‾ 1 as compared to control (un-cut) treatment yield of 3201 and 1973 kg ha‾ 1 both the year, respectively. The <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> obtained according to the cutting level of plant but the said treatments also gave an additional benefit of <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> of 4950 to 5550 and 3472 to 5347 kg ha‾ 1 without involvement of any extra cost of cultivation. Plant height and number of branches per plant were influenced by cutting levels whereas pods/plant and 1000 seeds weight did not differ significantly. Increase in seed yield {{may be the result of}} bearing more number of branches and pods per plant by the said treatment, which could easily matured within the available duration. The severe cutting of ground level gave maximum <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> both the years but lowest seed yield during 1999 - 2000 whereas in 2000 - 2001 after cutting, plant stand severely affected due to prevailing of foggy weather along with cold temperature remained in late December to mid January and later on crop completely failed to be recorded yield data...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 31 {{selection}} indices were constructed on five characters in 33 diversed genotypes of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). High heretability couple with high genetic advance {{expected in the}} next generation and association of characters were the basis for choosing of the characters for discriminant function analysis. <b>Green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield and grain yield have to be simultaneously improved through selection. Amongst the single character selection indices, grains/panicle offered maximum genetic worth (11. 51). In general, inclusion of every character in the function, exerted a progressive relative efficiency over straight selection. The highest relative efficiency over straight selection on grain yield alone was realized while grain yield/plant (x 1), fodder cutting maturity (x 2), <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield/plant (x 3), digestible dry matter/plant (x 4) and grains/panicle (x 5) were concurrently integrated in the function...|$|R
40|$|One newly {{developed}} variety of forage sorghum along with 7 check varieties was evaluated. The {{significant differences were}} observed for plant height, number of tillers per plant, stem thickness and <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield, while difference for number of leaves per plant was non-significant. Jincao 1 (272. 5 cm) produced the highest average plant height and stem thickness and produced {{the maximum number of}} tillers per plant. Jumbo ranked top in average <b>green</b> <b>fodder</b> yield by producing 111. 23 t ha - 1 closely followed by Jincao 1 (110. 85 t ha - 1). The varieties Jumbo, Jincao 1 produced far better yield than the other six check varieties. Jincao 1 has an average number of leaves per plant of 19 and has good tillers, which is a fine variety for forage...|$|R
