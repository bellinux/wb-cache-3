5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that <b>often</b> <b>were</b> considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E
5|$|Having {{abandoned}} {{not only}} the concert stage, but also the income that went with it, Ornstein signed an exclusive contract with the Ampico label to make piano rolls. He made over two dozen rolls for Ampico, mostly of a nonmodernist repertoire; the composers he performed most <b>often</b> <b>were</b> Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Two rolls contained his own compositions: Berceuse (Cradle Song) (c. 1920–21) and Prélude tragique (1924). Ornstein never recorded, in any format, even a single example of his futurist pieces which had brought him fame.|$|E

5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which <b>often</b> <b>were</b> built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the ceilings and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E
5|$|Word {{of mouth}} {{has it that}} an {{individual}} would have his debt paid when a third person or group would offer to pay it off if the bankrupt person undergoes the corda, serving as public entertainment. Those condemned to death <b>often</b> <b>were</b> subjected to endure torture and later hanged outside Valletta, in the whereabouts of the Bastion of St. Jacob. According to , the historian of the Order, amid {{the last three days}} of the Maltese carnival the locals used to recite a Roman tradition at the Castellany by dangling a stone above the pillory (instead of a human) and hit it which symbolised a temporal halt of punishment during those days.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meant to}} take place in Santa Barbara, California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed in and around the Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked to the set every day. The scripts for each Psych episode had to go through several reviews, and <b>often</b> <b>were</b> cut down by as much as a few dozen pages. A large portion of show's dialogue consists of on-the-spot improvisation by the actors, specifically Roday and Hill. The writers noted that much of the humor in the installments came from improvisation. The episode also included several reoccurring gags on the show, such as an introductory flashback and the inclusion of a pineapple; both gags were created by the action of one of the actors.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey was {{a patron}} of scholarship, and {{employed}} scholars throughout his life, one of whom, Honorius of Kent, Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter {{and wrote a}} legal work on canon law. The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed {{into the hands of}} Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts <b>often</b> <b>were,</b> was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741.|$|E
5|$|In 738 the {{interlinked}} {{fortunes of}} Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had installed {{him on his}} throne in 725. This coup {{does not seem to}} have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron deities. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities <b>often</b> <b>were</b> carried into battle on palanquins, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice, and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant due to death, resignation, or conviction of impeachment, the lieutenant governor assumes the title of governor. Should {{the office of}} lieutenant governor also become vacant, {{the president of the}} senate becomes the acting governor. If the vacancy of both offices took place during the first twenty months of the term, a special election is to be held on the next even-numbered year to elect new officers to serve out the current term. Prior to 1851, the speaker of the senate acted as governor for the term. Since 1978, the governor and lieutenant governor have been elected on the same ticket; prior to then, they could be (and <b>often</b> <b>were)</b> members of different parties.|$|E

5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers <b>often</b> <b>were</b> not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E
