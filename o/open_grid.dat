25|$|The {{geometry}} of the normal, <b>open</b> <b>grid</b> is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a Defensible Space Theory described {{ways to improve the}} social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, <b>open</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{electricity}} retail reform {{follows from}} electricity wholesale reform. However, {{it is possible}} to have a single electricity generation company and still have retail competition. If a wholesale price can be established at a node on the transmission grid and the electricity quantities at that node can be reconciled, competition for retail customers within the distribution system beyond the node is possible. In the German market, for example, large, vertically integrated utilities compete with one another for customers on a more or less <b>open</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} in California {{examined}} {{the amount of}} child play that occurred {{on the streets of}} neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the <b>open</b> <b>grid</b> streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic thereby encouraging more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe and most recently in Australia found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the Mackinac Bridge was {{directly}} influenced by the lessons from the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which failed in 1940 because of its instability in high winds. Three years after that disaster, Steinman had published a theoretical analysis of suspension-bridge stability problems, which recommended that future bridge designs include deep stiffening trusses to support the bridge deck and an open-grid roadway to reduce its wind resistance. Both of these features were incorporated into the {{design of the}} Mackinac Bridge. The stiffening truss is open to reduce wind resistance. The road deck is shaped as an airfoil to provide lift in a cross wind, and the center two lanes are <b>open</b> <b>grid</b> to allow vertical (upward) air flow, which fairly precisely cancels the lift, making the roadway stable in design in winds of up to [...]|$|E

To enable this computational infrastructure, we configured, {{for the first}} time, a LIGO Data Grid Tier- 1 Center that can submit heterogeneous LIGO workflows using <b>Open</b> Science <b>Grid</b> facilities. In order to enable a seamless connection between the LIGO Data Grid and Blue Waters via <b>Open</b> Science <b>Grid,</b> we utilize Shifter to containerize LIGO's workflow software. This work represents the first time <b>Open</b> Science <b>Grid,</b> Shifter, and Blue Waters are unified to tackle a scientific problem and, in particular, {{it is the first}} time a framework of this nature is used in the context of large scale gravitational wave data analysis. This new framework has been used in the last several weeks of LIGO's second discovery campaign to run the most computationally demanding gravitational wave search workflows on Blue Waters, and accelerate discovery in the emergent field of gravitational wave astrophysics. We discuss the implications of this novel framework for a wider ecosystem of Higher Performance Computing users. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|Currently, most {{computational}} grids (systems allowing transparent {{sharing of}} processing resources across organizational boundaries) are assembled using human negotiation. This procedure does not scale well, and is too inflexible {{to allow for}} large <b>open</b> <b>grids.</b> Peer-to-peer grids present an alternative way to build grid infrastructures {{with a large number}} of sites. However, to actually assemble a large grid, peers must have an incentive to collaborate by providing resources to the system. In this paper we propose an incentive mechanism called the Network of Favors, which is designed {{to make it in the}} best interest of each participating peer to make as much as possible of its spare processing resources available to the system. We show through analysis, simulations, and experiments with an implementation that the Network of Favors promotes collaboration in a simple and robust fashion.

The comparison of two recent plans of district redevelopment in Paris and Istanbul by the firms OMA and Zaha Hadid Architects has confirmed the modern character of the grid.
