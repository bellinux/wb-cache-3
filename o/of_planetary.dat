40|$|In the paper, {{the design}} and {{operation}} <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> cycloidal transmission have been discussed. The transmission is a synthesis <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> and the straight-line mechanism. The planetary mechanism is made <b>of</b> a <b>planetary</b> gear set with rollers, which is critical for the proper work of the transmission. Its basic and most important element is the planetary cycloidal gear. Influence of the parameters determining the cycloidal profile of the gear on the gear’s geometry and the forces has been presented. The straight-line mechanism carrying the motion from the driving onto the driven unit of the transmission is made of the pins and bushes located in the holes <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> gears. The influence of the number and geometry of the elements on the forces and occuring in the holes <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> gears has been presented. Therefore, the properly defined geometry of the gear and of the material of which the gear is made is crucial for the safe operation <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> cycloidal transmission...|$|R

5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the periodic movement <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system and its influence on solar activity is currently a serious topic in research. The kinematic index of the planet juncture index has been developed to find the track and variation of the Sun around the centroid {{of the solar system}} and the periodicity of solar activity. In the present study, the kinematic index <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system's heliocentric longitude, developed based on the orbital elements of planets in the solar system, and it is used to investigate the periodic movement <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system. The kinematic index <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system's heliocentric longitude and that of the planet juncture index are simulated and analyzed. The numerical simulation of the two kinematic indexes shows orderly orbits and disorderly orbits of 49. 9 and 129. 6  years, respectively. Two orderly orbits or two disorderly orbits show a period change rule of 179. 5  years. The contrast analysis between the periodic movement <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system and the periodicity of solar activity shows that the two phenomena exhibit a period change rule of 179. 5  years. Moreover, orderly orbits correspond to high periods of solar activity and disorderly orbits correspond to low periods of solar activity. Therefore, the relative movement <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system affects solar activity to some extent. The relationship provides a basis for discussing the movement <b>of</b> the <b>planetary</b> system and solar activity...|$|R

5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E

5|$|Newton's {{contribution}} to gravitational theory was {{to unify the}} motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth.

5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, which suggests that it is a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these objects were incorporated into larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this early stage <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> formation.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> rings that makes it visually unique.

The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E
5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius.

5|$|The {{earliest}} scientific {{models of}} the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at {{the centre of the}} Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> motion.|$|E
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to}} be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|The nebular {{hypothesis}} {{is the most}} widely accepted model {{in the field of}} cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System (as well as other planetary systems). It suggests that the Solar System formed from nebulous material. The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the Universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular {{hypothesis is}} the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion {{in the same direction as}} the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> formation, but most elements have been superseded.|$|E

5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres.

5|$|With the {{discovery}} and observation <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> systems around stars {{other than the}} Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 (helium)—is now thought to determine {{the likelihood that a}} star will have planets. Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, population II star.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides <b>of</b> <b>planetary</b> orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E
