5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} <b>oxidation</b> <b>resistance</b> and decrease in flammability.|$|E

500|$|The high {{melting point}} and <b>oxidation</b> <b>resistance</b> lead {{to the use of}} the metal in the {{production}} of vacuum furnace parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and {{high melting point}}. [...] It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material. The high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding. Because tantalum is a non-ferrous, non-magnetic metal, these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures. The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses.|$|E

To make transformable martensitic type of 12 CrODS steels that have superior processing capability by using alpha/gamma phase transformation, alloy design was conducted through varying nickel content. The structure of 12 CrODS steels was successfully modified from full ferrite to a transformable martensite-base matrix containing ferrite. This ferrite consists of both equilibrium ferrite and a metastable residual ferrite. It was {{shown that the}} fraction of the equilibrium ferrite is predictable by computed phase diagram and formation of the residual ferrite was successfully evaluated through pinning of alpha/gamma interfacial boundaries by oxide particles...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{sintering}} aids for densifying ceramics can lead to problems associated with formation of low viscosity or glassy intergranular phases. This problem has been intensively studied in out laboratory and a system has been developed whereby densification is achieved using rare-earth oxides with silica as additives, and subsequent crystallization to develop the intergranular crystalline RE 2 Si 2 O 7, although complete removal of glassy phases is not achieved. The results are quite exciting in that 91 % of the room temperature strength is retained at 1300 °C and both creep and <b>oxidation</b> <b>resistances</b> are superior to those in the published literature. Currently, room temperature tests suggest that both fracture toughness and cyclic fatigue behavior of these materials are comparable to those of conventional silicon nitrides with amorphous grain boundaries.

40|$|Comparative thermal-fatigue and <b>oxidation</b> <b>resistances</b> of cobalt-modified wrought Udimet 700 alloy (obtained by {{reducing}} the cobalt level by direct substitution of nickel) were determined from fluidized-bed tests. Bed temperatures were 1010 and 288 C (1850 and 550 C) for the first 5500 symmetrical 6 -min cycles. From cycle 5501 to the 14000 -cycle limit of testing, the heating bed temperature was increased to 1050 C (1922 F). Cobalt levels between 0 and 17 wt% were studied in both the bare and NiCrAlY overlay coated conditions. A cobalt level of about 8 wt% gave the best thermal-fatigue life. The conventional alloy specification is for 18. 5 % cobalt, and hence, a factor of 2 in savings of cobalt could be achieved by using the modified alloy. After 13500 cycles, all bare cobalt-modified alloys lost 10 to 13 percent of their initial weight.

40|$|In {{the search}} for newer {{distributed}} phases {{that can be used}} in Ni-composite coatings, inexpensive and naturally available pumice has been identified as a potential candidate material. The composition of the pumice mineral as determined by Rietveld analysis shows the presence of corundum, quartz, mulllite, moganite and coesite phases. Pumice stone is crushed, ball-milled, dried and dispersed in a nickel sulfamate bath and Ni-pumice coatings are electrodeposited at different current densities and magnetic agitation speeds. Pumice particles are uniformly incorporated in the nickel matrix and Ni-pumice composite coatings with microhardness as high as 540 HK are obtained at the lowest applied current density. In the electrodeposited Ni-pumice coatings, the grain size of Ni increases with the applied current density. The overall intensity of texture development is slightly stronger for the Ni-pumice composite coating compared to plain Ni coating and the texture evolution is possibly not the strongest deciding factor for the enhanced properties of Ni-pumice coatings. The wear and <b>oxidation</b> <b>resistances</b> of Ni-pumice coating are commensurate with that of Ni-SiC coating electrodeposited under similar conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
