5|$|A {{series of}} {{disturbing}} events troubled Monteverdi's {{world in the}} period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and {{over a period of}} 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.|$|E
5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> <b>and</b> a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E

5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would have a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established {{to make use of the}} Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E

25|$|Political {{repression}} and fraud, {{as well as}} huge income inequalities exacerbated by the land distribution system based on latifundios, in which large haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of underpaid peasants living in precarious conditions, led to the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), an armed conflict that drastically transformed Mexico's political, social, cultural, and economical structure {{during the twentieth century}} under a premise of social democracy. The war itself left a harsh toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> population, which decreased over the 11-year period between 1910 and 1921. The reconstruction of the country was to take place in the following decades.|$|E
25|$|The social {{security}} system, which expanded rapidly during the prosperous 1950s and 1960s, includes a medical system, unemployment insurance coverage, child allowances, invalid benefits, {{and other benefits}} and pensions. With the onset of a recession in the 1970s, this system became an increasing burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> accounted {{for much of the}} government budget deficits. The national unemployment figures mask considerable differences between Flanders and Wallonia. Unemployment in Wallonia is mainly structural, while in Flanders it is cyclical. Flanders' unemployment levels are generally only about half those of Wallonia. The southern region continues a difficult transition out of sunset industries (mainly coal and steel), while sunrise industries (chemicals, high-tech, and services) dominate in Flanders.|$|E
25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden {{not to do}} it, saying the American people would never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> <b>and</b> the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union.

25|$|In 1917, {{the year}} before Willingdon's {{resignation}} of the governorship, a severe famine {{broke out in the}} Kheda region of the Bombay Presidency, which had far reaching effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> left farmers in no position to pay their taxes. Still, the government insisted that tax not only be paid but also implemented a 23% increase to the levies to take effect that year. Kheda thus became the setting for Gandhi's first satyagraha in India, and, with support from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Ravi Shankar Vyas, organised a Gujarat sabha. The people under Gandhi's influence then rallied together and sent a petition to Willingdon, asking that he cancel the taxes for that year. However, the Cabinet refused and advised the Governor to begin confiscating property by force, leading Gandhi to thereafter employ non-violent resistance to the government, which eventually succeeded and made Gandhi famous throughout India after Willingdon's departure from the colony. For his actions there, in relation to governance and the war effort, Willingdon was on 3 June 1918 appointed by the King as a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India.|$|E
25|$|According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer {{the biggest}} primary {{impact of the}} New Deal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> the key to {{recovery}} and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis {{is based on the}} observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933 people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.|$|E
