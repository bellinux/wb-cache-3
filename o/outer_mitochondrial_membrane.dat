5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> which {{encloses}} {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Å) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer membrane, which then actively moves them across the membrane. Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer membrane also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer membrane permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer membrane can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|During hypoxia, {{a protein}} called Hif1α is {{activated}} and causes TIGAR to re-localise from the cytoplasm to the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane.</b> Here, HK2 {{is bound to}} an anion channel in the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> called VDAC. TIGAR binds hexokinase 2 and increases its activity by an as yet unknown mechanism.|$|E
25|$|TIGAR also reduces ROS by {{increasing}} the activity of HK2. HK2 reduces ROS levels indirectly by keeping ADP levels at the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> high. If ADP levels fall, the rate of respiration decreases and causes the electron transport chain to become over-reduced with excess electrons. These excess electrons pass to oxygen and form ROS.|$|E

40|$|Hereditary methemoglobinemia with {{generalized}} {{deficiency of}} NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase (b 5 R) (type II) {{is a rare}} disease characterized by severe developmental abnormalities, which often lead to premature death. Although the molecular relationship between the symptoms of this condition and the enzyme deficit are not understood, {{it is thought that}} an important cause is the loss of the lipid metabolizing activities of the endoplasmic reticulum-located reductase. However, the functions of the form located on <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> have not been considered previously. In this study, we have analyzed the gene of an Italian patient and identified a novel G [...] >T transversion at the splice-acceptor site of the 9 th exon, which results in the complete absence of immunologically detectable b 5 R in blood cells and skin fibroblasts. In cultured fibroblasts of the patient, NADH-dependent cytochrome c reductase, ferricyanide reductase, and semidehydroascorbate reductase activities were severely reduced. The latter activity is known to be due to b 5 R located on <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes.</b> Thus, our results demonstrate that the reductase in its two membrane locations, endoplasmic reticulum and <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes,</b> is the product of the same gene and suggest that a defect in ascorbate regeneration may contribute to the phenotype of hereditary methemoglobinemia of the generalized type...|$|R

Hop (HSP organizing protein) mediates {{the interaction between}} different HSPs, forming HSP70–HSP90 complexes.

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 is involved in regulation of biosynthesis of cardiolipin in mitochondria, and its overexpression in cultured cells resulted in increased cardiolipin synthase, activity. As cardiolipin is synthesized in the luminal side of inner mitochondrial membrane, a major fraction of this newly synthesized pool of cardiolipin has to be translocated from the inner to the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane.</b> PLSCR3 has been proposed {{to be involved in}} this translocation from the inner to the outer membrane that is essential for maintaining the mitochondrial architecture, mass, and transmembrane potential.|$|E
500|$|A {{critical}} {{role for the}} ER in calcium signaling was acknowledged before such a role for the mitochondria was widely accepted, {{in part because the}} low affinity of Ca2+ channels localized to the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane</b> seemed to fly {{in the face of this}} organelle's purported responsiveness to changes in intracellular Ca2+ flux. But the presence of the MAM resolves this apparent contradiction: the close physical association between the two organelles results in Ca2+ microdomains at contact points that facilitate efficient Ca2+ transmission from the ER to the mitochondria. Transmission occurs in response to so-called [...] "Ca2+ puffs" [...] generated by spontaneous clustering and activation of IP3R, a canonical ER membrane Ca2+ channel.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5, reductase are {{integral}} membrane proteins with cytosolic active domains and short membrane anchors, which are inserted post-translationally into their target membranes. Both are produced as different isoforms, with different localizations, in mammalian cells. In the rat, the reductase gene generates two transcripts by an alternative promoter mechanism: a ubiquitous mRNA coding for the myristylated membrane-bound form, and an erythroid mRNA which generates both the soluble form and a nonmyristylated membrane-binding form. The available {{evidence indicates that}} the ubiquitous myristylated form binds to the cytosolic face of both <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> and ER. In contrast, two genes code for two homologous forms of cytochrome b 5, {{one of which is}} found on <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes,</b> the other on the ER. The gene specifying the ER form probably also generates an erythroid-specific mRNA by alternative splicing, which codes for soluble cytochrome b 5. Possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed localizations of these different enzyme isoforms are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Hsp27 is also {{involved}} in the apoptotic signalling pathway. Hsp27 interacts with the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes</b> and interferes with the activation of cytochrome c/Apaf-1/dATP complex and therefore inhibits the activation of procaspase-9. The phosphorylated form of Hsp27 inhibits Daxx apoptotic protein and prevents the association of Daxx with Fas and Ask1. Moreover, Hsp27 phosphorylation leads to the activation of TAK1 and TAK1-p38/ERK pro-survival signaling, thus opposing TNF-α-induced apoptosis.|$|R
2500|$|Cytochrome c is also {{released}} from mitochondria due to {{formation of a}} channel, the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), in the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane,</b> and serves a regulatory function as it precedes morphological change associated with apoptosis. [...] Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome. [...] The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn activates the effector caspase-3.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, the [...] NADH + H+ {{generated}} by glycolysis {{has to be}} transferred to the mitochondrion to be oxidized, and thus to regenerate the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue. However the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. [...] Use is therefore made of two “shuttles” to transport the electrons from NADH across the mitochondrial membrane. They are the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle. In the former the electrons from NADH are transferred to cytosolic oxaloacetate to form malate. The malate then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is reoxidized by NAD+ forming intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate and NADH. The oxaloacetate is then re-cycled to the cytosol via its conversion to aspartate which is readily transported out of the mitochondrion. In the glycerol phosphate shuttle electrons from cytosolic NADH are transferred to dihydroxyacetone to form glycerol-3-phosphate which readily traverses the <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membrane.</b> Glycerol-3-phosphate is then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone, donating its electrons to FAD instead of NAD+. This reaction takes place on the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing FADH2 to donate its electrons directly to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) {{which is part of the}} electron transport chain which ultimately transfers electrons to molecular oxygen (O2), with the formation of water, and the release of energy eventually captured in the form of ATP.|$|E

The increase in surface pressure was dependent on (1) the amount and (2) the oligometric form of Mi-CK in the subphase, as well as on (3) the initial surface pressure and (4) the phospholipid composition of the monolayer.

40|$|NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase {{is known}} to be located on two {{distinct}} membranes, i. e. endoplasmic reticulum and <b>outer</b> <b>mitochondrial</b> <b>membranes.</b> The endoplasmic-reticulum-associated form of the enzyme contains myristic acid in an amide linkage to its N-terminal glycine [Ozols, Carr & Strittmatter (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13349 - 13354]. To investigate whether the dual subcellular localization of the reductase corresponds to a difference in fatty acylation, the enzyme was purified from well-characterized rat liver microsomal and mitochondrial fractions and analysed by a new quantitative analytical procedure. The purified reductases were run on SDS/polyacrylamide gels and blotted on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The reductase-containing bands were treated with hydroxylamine, and amide-linked fatty acids were then detached by acid hydrolysis. The detached fatty acids were extracted, derivatized and analysed as phenylacyl esters by reverse-phase h. p. l. c., and the protein content of the samples was determined by amino acid analysis of the acid hydrolysates. Myristic acid was found in both the microsomal and mitochondrial reductases in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 with protein.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} {{network is}} a dynamic organization within eukaryotic cells that participates {{in a variety of}} essential cellular processes, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, central metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation.
