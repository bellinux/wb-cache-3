Option sellers are {{generally}} seen as taking on more risk because they are contractually obligated to take the opposite futures position if the options buyer exercises their right to the futures position specified in the option.

50|$|However, {{the cost}} to the option buyer of exercising the option is not zero. For instance, the buyer's broker may charge {{transaction}} fees to exercise the option to buy or sell the underlier. If these costs are greater than the amount the option is in the money, the owner of the option may rationally choose not to exercise. Thus, the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> may end up with an unexpected position in the underlier and thus risk losing value if the underlier's price then moves adversely before the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> can eliminate this position, perhaps not until the next trading day. The costs of exercise differ from trader to trader, and therefore the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> {{may not be able to}} predict whether the options will be exercised or not.|$|E

The earliest results evidenced that VIX is the gauge of investor fear, where in the expected stock market volatility rises when the given market is declined. It is also proven that expected volatility is being unbiased estimate of the actual return volatility (30 -calendar days); hence, during the market turmoil VIX likely to be biased. Lastly, {{it is suggested that}} the nervousness of investor yields potential profit to the <b>options</b> <b>seller</b> (market crises).

50|$|The {{owner of}} an option {{contract}} {{has the right to}} exercise it, and thus require that the financial transaction specified by the contract is to be carried out immediately between the two parties, whereupon the option contract is terminated. When exercising a call option, the owner of the option purchases the underlying shares (or commodities, fixed interest securities, etc.) at the strike price from the <b>option</b> <b>seller,</b> while for a put option, the owner of the option sells the underlying to the <b>option</b> <b>seller,</b> again at the strike price.|$|E
5000|$|Cash {{settlement}} - Cash-settled options do {{not require}} the actual delivery of the underlier. Instead, the market value, at the exercise date, of the underlier is compared to the strike price, and the difference (if in a favourable direction) is paid by the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> to {{the owner of the}} option. An example of a cash-settled contract is most U.S.-listed exchange-traded index options. This settlement occurs the next business day following the trade.|$|E

50|$|The {{buyer of}} a call option {{has the right}} to buy a {{specific}} number of shares from the call <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> at a strike price at an expiration date (European Option). Since a naked call seller does not have the stock in case the option buyer decides to exercise the option, the seller has to buy stock at the open market in order to deliver it at the strike price. Since the share price has no limit to how far it can rise, the naked call seller is exposed to unlimited risk.|$|E
50|$|Sellers of option {{contracts}} often hedge {{them to create}} delta neutral portfolios. The objective is to minimize risk due to {{the movement of the}} underlier's price, while implementing whatever strategy led to the sale of the options in the first place. For instance, a seller of a call may hedge by buying just enough of the underlier to create a delta neutral portfolio. As time passes, the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> adjusts his hedge position by buying or selling some quantity of the underlier to counteract changes in the price of the underlier.|$|E
5000|$|In finance, {{the time}} value (TV) (extrinsic or {{instrumental}} value) of an option is the premium a rational investor would pay over its current exercise value (intrinsic value), {{based on the}} probability it will increase in value before expiry. For an American option this value is always greater than zero in a fair market, thus an option is always worth more than its current exercise value.. As an option {{can be thought of}} as 'price insurance' (e.g., an airline insuring against unexpected soaring fuel costs caused by a hurricane), TV {{can be thought of as}} the risk premium the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> charges the buyer—the higher the expected risk (volatility [...] time), the higher the premium. Conversely, TV can be thought of as the price an investor is willing to pay for potential upside.|$|E

40|$|Buying put {{options is}} {{commonly}} understood {{to provide a}} measure of insurance against price declines. As such, the cost of options is strongly correlated {{to the amount of}} fear in the market. It might be prudent in these cases to make the opposite trade [...] selling put <b>options.</b> The <b>seller</b> (or writer) collects the premium, which during times of fear is very large. The risk is a significant decline in prices. See the article here, Forbes...|$|R
50|$|The seller's {{potential}} loss on a naked put can be substantial. If the stock falls {{all the way}} to zero (bankruptcy), his loss is equal to the strike price (at which he must buy the stock to cover the option) minus the premium received. The potential upside is the premium received when selling the option: if the stock price is above the strike price at expiration, the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> keeps the premium, and the option expires worthless. During the option's lifetime, if the stock moves lower, the option's premium may increase (depending on how far the stock falls and how much time passes). If it does, it becomes more costly to close the position (repurchase the put, sold earlier), resulting in a loss. If the stock price completely collapses before the put position is closed, the put writer potentially can face catastrophic loss. In order to protect the put buyer from default, the put writer is required to post margin. The put buyer does not need to post margin because the buyer would not exercise the option if it had a negative payoff.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if a stock {{trades at}} $50 {{right now and}} you buy its call option with a $50 strike price, {{you have the right}} to {{purchase}} that stock for $50 regardless of the current stock price as long as it has not expired. Even if the stock rises to $100, you still have the right to buy that stock for $50 as long as the call option has not expired. When the price of the underlying instrument surpasses the strike price, the option is said to be [...] "in the money". On the other hand, if the stock falls to below $50, the buyer will never exercise the option, since he would have to pay $50 per share when he can buy the same stock for less. If this occurs, the option expires worthless and the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> keeps the premium as profit. The payoff is as scaled and shifted ramp function, frequently referred to as a hockey stick, due to the resemblance to an ice hockey stick. Since the payoff of purchased call options increases as the stock price rises, buying call options is considered bullish. Conversely, since the payoff for sold (or written) call options increases as the stock price falls, selling call options is considered bearish.|$|E
40|$|We derive {{behavioral}} finance {{option pricing}} formulas {{consistent with the}} rational dynamic asset pricing theory. In the existing behavioral finance option pricing formulas, the price process of the representative agent is not a semimartingale, which leads to arbitrage opportunities for the <b>option</b> <b>seller.</b> In the literature on behavioral finance option pricing it is allowed the option buyer and seller to have different views on the instantaneous mean return of the underlying price process, which leads to arbitrage opportunities according to Black (1972). We adjust the behavioral finance option pricing formulas {{to be consistent with}} the rational dynamic asset pricing theory, by introducing transaction costs on the velocity of trades which offset the gains from the arbitrage trades...|$|E
25|$|A special {{situation}} called pin risk {{can arise}} when the underlying closes at or {{very close to}} the option's strike value on the last day the option is traded prior to expiration. The <b>option</b> writer (<b>seller)</b> may not know with certainty whether or not the option will actually be exercised or be allowed to expire. Therefore, the option writer may end up with a large, unwanted residual position in the underlying when the markets open on the next trading day after expiration, regardless of his or her best efforts to avoid such a residual.|$|R

40|$|This article evaluates Tourinho's (1979) work {{as one of}} the {{earliest}} contributors to the real options literature. His model pioneered the application of risk neutrality to uncertain investments, but his originality of introducing an option-holding cost albeit to overcome the extraction paradox is rarely imitated. We claim that the combination of a convenience yield and an option-holding cost produces a more satisfying representation. Moreover, variations in the holding cost give rise to a host of investment decisions ranging from the standard real option solution for a zero-holding cost to a net present value solution for an infinite-holding cost. Not only does the holding cost mediate between these two poles, but it provides the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> (usually a landowner or a government) with a policy instrument for influencing the extraction timing and thus the extraction profit of the option buyer. We derive the holding cost that optimizes the landowner's combined value of the option premium, holding costs and eventual royalties...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new call option where the <b>option</b> <b>seller</b> pays the minimum price (in {{inflated}} dollars) that the asset has ever traded at {{during the time}} period (which may be indefinitely long) between the selling time and the delivery time (to be chosen by the seller). This option is the dual of the put option where the option buyer receives the maximum price (in discounted dollars) that the asset has ever traded at during the time period (which may be indefinitely long) between the buying time and the exercise time (to be chosen by the buyer). Because the settlement payoff is at the minimum (for the call) or the maximum (for the put) there is reduced regret {{in the sense that}} it is not necessary for the option holder to worry about missing a good price in the recent past (of course he may regret not holding on longer) since he gets the best price up to the settlement time. We give the exact simple formula for the optimal expected present value (fair price) that can be derived from the opt [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with valuing options on traded accounts using both continuous and discrete time models. An option on a traded account is a zero strike call on the balance of a trading account which consists of a position of size θ in a risky asset (which we refer to as a stock) and the remaining wealth in a risk-free account. The choice of trading positions throughout {{the life of the}} option are made by the buyer, subject to constraints specified in the contract at the time of purchase. The specification of these trading constraints gives rise to some of the more well known examples including passport options and vacation options. At maturity, the option buyer is entitled to any positive wealth accumulated in the trading account whilst any losses are covered by the <b>option</b> <b>seller.</b> First, we examine the problem of valuing these options in continuous time. A review of some existing methods is presented, including a complete derivation of the pricing formula for the passport option and the option on a traded account following the methods proposed by Hyer et al. (1997) and Shreve and Vecer (2000), though we often use different techniques to those authors. We also present an alternative derivation for the value of a passport option using our own methodology which we believe is simpler than those currently available. Secondly, we consider the valuation problem in a discrete time setting by looking at one specific discrete time model, the binomial tree. This is a new contribution to the literature as binomial models for these options have not been previously examined. Using this approach, the greatest difficulty is the determination of an optimal trading strategy which is required to price this class of option. We show that in general, binomial models and continuous time models {{do not have the same}} trading strategy, and in fact that the analytic determination of the trading strategy for an option on a traded account may in fact be impossible to obtain. We then turn to passport options, where we are able to derive an analytic optimal strategy which in this case is identical to that used in the continuous time models, thus the problem of valuing passport options is reduced to the same computational burdens as a binomial valuation without recombining branches. Lastly, we examine some numerical methods which could be used to value options on traded accounts with binomial models. Our problem is shown to be an NP-hard convex maximisation which we convert into both an l 1 -norm convex maximisation and an indefinite quadratic program. Whilst we present algorithms which are guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution, they are also known to be inefficient and thus inappropriate for any likely application beyond a few time steps. We conclude by summarising our results and give directions for future research in this area...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} have a valid option the tenant-buyer must in most cases provide [...] "valuable consideration" [...] (a fee) for the <b>option.</b> Generally, <b>sellers</b> will ask for as much as possible--often around 3%-5% of the {{purchase}} price. The tenant-buyer usually will want to provide as little as possible--even a token amount of $100 represents [...] "consideration." [...] The option gives the tenant the right (but not the obligation) to purchase the property at a later date. The lease option only binds the seller to sell, it does not bind the buyer to buy.

50|$|An Evergreen {{option is}} an option where the buyer {{has the right to}} {{exercise}} by providing a pre-determined period of notice. This option could be either American or European in nature or alternatively it could be combined with option styles that have non-vanilla exercise rights. For example, an ‘Evergreen-Bermudan’ option provides the buyer of the option with the right to exercise at set specific points in time after providing the other counterparty with a pre-determined period of notice of their intent to exercise the option. Evergreen <b>options</b> provide <b>sellers</b> with a period of time to prepare for settlement once the buyer has exercised their rights under the option. Embedding evergreen optionality within on and off-balance sheet products can enable counterparties (such as banks that must adhere to Basel III) to lengthen their inflow or outflow obligations.|$|R
