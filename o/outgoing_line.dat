2500|$|Once hooked, a small trout can {{be easily}} {{retrieved}} [...] "on the reel" [...] or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching {{the line between the}} rod handle and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the rod tip high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish's struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line is already on the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the rod handle, one's foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really large trout can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the <b>outgoing</b> <b>line</b> using the fisher's fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel's drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it won't spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.|$|E
50|$|In a {{multidrop}} line arrangement (a central computer and different terminals {{in which the}} terminals share a single communication line {{to and from the}} computer), the system uses a master/slave polling arrangement whereby the central computer sends message (called polling message) to a specific terminal on the <b>outgoing</b> <b>line.</b> All terminals listen to the <b>outgoing</b> <b>line,</b> but only the terminal that is polled replies by sending any information that it has ready for transmission on the incoming line.|$|E

30|$|The {{rationality}} {{can also}} be verified by comparative analysis between two nodes. For example, node 5 and 9 have {{the same number of}} incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines.</b> Flow value rankings of two incoming <b>lines</b> and two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> of node 5 are 2 nd, 7 th and 4 th, 6 th. Flow value rankings of two incoming <b>lines</b> and two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> of node 9 are 9 th, 13 th and 14 th, 17 th. Therefore, node 5 is more important than node 9 for larger power flow values of its incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines.</b> In method 1, the importance rankings of two nodes are 3 rd and 6 th, which accord with actual situation. However, in method 2, the importance rankings of two nodes are much closer {{due to the fact that}} they have the same number of <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>lines.</b> It is unreasonable. Similarly, the analysis can be applied to nodes 2 and 6. It shows that node importance ranking of power grid without consideration of power flow is determined by the topology of power grid to a greater extent. It is inconsistent with practical situation of power grid.|$|R

50|$|A PBX {{differs from}} a key {{telephone}} system (KTS) in that users {{of a key}} system manually select their own outgoing lines on special telephone sets that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the <b>outgoing</b> <b>line</b> automatically, or formerly, by an operator.

5000|$|Two B Channel Transfer or TBCT for short, is an {{emerging}} telephony technology, where a telephone conversation on an incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>line</b> on a PBX {{can be passed}} [...] "up the chain" [...] to the telephone company, freeing up two lines on the PBX. TBCT permits more efficient routing and use of available telephone lines, because callers can [...] "pair" [...] together, without loading the PBX with the call for its entire duration. This makes telephone call routing much more scalable.|$|E
5000|$|This {{function}} is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, {{one for the}} incoming line {{and the other for}} the <b>outgoing</b> <b>line.</b> The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this wiring scheme with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C adaptor is plugged into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices.|$|E

The first two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> {{are connected to the}} critical nodes 49 and 65. The importance of these two nodes ranks at 3 rd and 4 th of 118 nodes, respectively. Active power output of the generator ranks at 5 th of all generators, which is 8.52  % of total active power output of all generators. However, nodes 89 and 66 cannot be found in the top 20 nodes of methods 2 and 3.|$|R

30|$|Different {{speeds of}} a wind turbine {{will affect the}} value of {{measured}} Δθ.

30|$|Besides, in method 1, the {{importance}} ranking of node 3 is 5 th for the load of node 3 {{is the largest}} in IEEE 14 -bus system. And node 11 is evaluated as the least important node. Node 11 is connected to no generator or load. It only has one <b>outgoing</b> <b>line</b> and one incoming line. Flow value rankings of its outgoing and incoming line are 18 th and 11 th.|$|E
30|$|Node 30 is {{connected}} to no load or generator. However, nodes 8 and 26, whose importance ranks at 7 th and 26 th, are connected to node 30. The flow value rankings of the two corresponding incoming lines are 7 th, 20 th. Nodes 17 and 38, whose importance ranks at 23 rd and 24 th, are also connected to node 30. The flow value rankings of the two corresponding <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are 9 th, 29 th. Therefore, node 30 ranks at 18 th in method 1 because not only authority scores and hub scores of its adjacent points but also the weights of its incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are large. It reflects the key idea of MBCC-HITS algorithm.|$|R
30|$|As to a node {{of power}} grid, its {{importance}} is determined in aspects of inflow and outflow power. Therefore, {{the importance of}} a node depends on the numbers and importance of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines,</b> as well as the importance of nodes connected to this node.|$|R
30|$|The {{comparison}} of node importance rankings between methods 1 and 2 is {{to verify the}} rationality of the modification based on power flow. As is shown in Table  2, node 1 {{is the most important}} node in method 1. This node has two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> and is connected to a generator. The active power output of the generator equals 232.84  MW, which is 89.90  % of total active load in IEEE 14 -bus system. The flow values of two <b>outgoing</b> <b>lines</b> are the first and second largest of total twenty lines in IEEE 14 -bus system. So node 1 is a fairly vital node of IEEE 14 -bus system, which is consistent with the node importance ranking of method 1. However, in method 2, the importance ranking of node 1 is 13 th and the importance ranking of node 4 which has the most <b>outgoing</b> and incoming <b>lines</b> is 1 st. It shows that the node importance ranking without consideration of power flow is unreasonable.|$|R

At present， 10 kV aerial line is widely used in our country, after coming out through the substation circuit breaker (the column switch are various, but the most widely used is circuit breaker or load switch). The lines are separated by the column switch. In the branches, column switch and disconnector are also widely used to control the lines. In the client side of 10 kv lines, generally us...|$|E

The new method mainly utilizes the characteristics that the short circuit current of the forward fault is usually a non-power frequency attenuation AC component, while the short circuit current of the backward fault is a power-frequency AC component. If the phase angle difference of the fault current is large {{after a period of}} failure, it {{is considered to be a}} positive direction export fault; if the phase angle difference is small but the amplitude difference is large, it is still considered as a forward outlet fault; if the phase angle difference and amplitude difference of the fault current calculation are relatively small, it is considered to be a reverse outlet fault of the <b>outgoing</b> <b>line.</b> A large-scale wind farm model is established in PSCAD environment to verify the proposed protection. Simulation results show that the fault direction can be accurately identified on both sides of the line when a three-phase fault occurs.|$|E
