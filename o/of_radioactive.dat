5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> waste. Much lower concentrations <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the conversion problem <b>of</b> five <b>radioactive</b> materials, {{the relationship and}} the effects <b>of</b> various <b>radioactive</b> parameters (decay constant and mean lifetime) on radioactive processes were also presented. A system of five coupled ordinary differential equations was obtained. The method of Variational Iteration Method and Homotopy Perturbation Method were applied to obtain the exact solutions to the system of coupled differential equations. The methods {{reduce the size of}} computations and do not require large computer resources and discretization of the variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the methods were achieved as the results obtained rapidly converge after few numbers of iterations. The results obtained show that the mean life time <b>of</b> the <b>radioactive</b> materials decreases with time while the decay constant <b>of</b> the <b>radioactive</b> materials increases with time, also it was observed that, the higher the decay constant <b>of</b> a <b>radioactive</b> material, the faster the rate of conversion. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} land-based subductive {{waste disposal}} method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land, and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement.

5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E

5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|At {{particular}} issue was {{the ability of}} sensors to differentiate an underground test from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> debris.

5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, {{the project}} {{expanded}} to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium {{for most of the}} more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements.
