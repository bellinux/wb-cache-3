5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films,</b> Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was {{set aside for the}} main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films,</b> with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E
