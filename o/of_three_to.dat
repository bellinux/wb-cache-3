5|$|A clutch {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by {{the female}} alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked {{and have their}} eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. The next twenty years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track mileage, and property values would each increase by a factor <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four.|$|E

5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables {{with which they are}} stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who by a majority <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, to a depth <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four feet, before it was discovered.

5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires.

Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3mm and diameters <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.|$|E

5|$|Solitary {{places are}} the best venues for yoga. A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four years.|$|E

5|$|The only {{exception}} to this arrangement was Operation Commando Bolt, a real-time, LORAN-based technique which utilized sensor strike zones derived from predicted target locations. These missions were coordinated by Task Force Alpha's Sycamore control center against targets that passed through strike modules (four strings <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> six sensors each). Air controllers at Sycamore then directly delivered the correct course, altitude, and speed necessary for the strike aircraft to deliver their ordnance to the correct coordinates.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton {{has very}} broad and {{straight}} downtown streets (generally {{two or three}} full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning; streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four pairs of oxen to turn around. In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.|$|E
