5000|$|<b>Obstructive</b> lung <b>disease</b> is a {{category}} of respiratory disease characterized by airway obstruction. Many <b>obstructive</b> <b>diseases</b> of the lung result from narrowing of the smaller bronchi and larger bronchioles, often because of excessive contraction of the smooth muscle itself.

Types of <b>obstructive</b> lung <b>disease</b> include; asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchitis and chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> (COPD). Although COPD shares similar characteristics with all other <b>obstructive</b> lung <b>diseases,</b> such as the signs of coughing and wheezing, they are distinct conditions in terms of disease onset, frequency of symptoms and reversibility of airway obstruction.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic <b>obstructive</b> {{pulmonary}} <b>disease</b> in non-smokers {{has been}} an important concern in past decade. We studied the risk factors responsible for more severe Chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> Identifying them would help to work against progression to more severe disease as well as prevention. Methods: A prospective cross sectional study was done in outpatient clinic of Jinnah postgraduate medical center from December 2010 to December 2011. All patients fulfilling the criteria for Chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> were taken in study. Patients with less than five pack years smoking with other risk factors for Chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> were evaluated. Results: Out of total 90 patients, 74 (82. 2 %) had mild chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> and 16 (17. 7 %) had moderate to severe chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> Patients with single biomass exposure were found to have mild chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> except those having mosquito coil exposure. Patients with mosquito coil and wood smoke exposure were observed to have moderate to severe chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> (p-value 0. 009). Conclusions: Wood smokewith mosquito coil smoke exposure is responsible for more severe chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> _______________________________________________________________________________________ Keywords: biomass; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; non-smoker; tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: oropharyngeal {{dysphagia}} {{in patients}} with chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> PURPOSE: patients with Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease</b> (COPD) can be vulnerable to respiratory incompetence {{that may lead to}} swallowing impairment. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the relationship between Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease</b> and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Forty-seven articles were retrieved relating to Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease</b> and dysphagia. Each article was graded using evidence-based methodology. Only 7 articles out of the 47 addressed oropharyngeal swallowing disorders {{in patients with}} Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease.</b> This review found few studies that documented the relationship between oropharyngeal swallowing disorders and Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease.</b> There were no randomized control trials. CONCLUSION: although the evidence is not strong, it appears that patients with Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease</b> are prone to oropharyngeal dysphagia during exacerbations. Future studies are needed to document the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in homogeneous groups of patients with Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease,</b> and to assess the relationship between respiration and swallowing using simultaneous measures of swallowing biomechanics and respiratory function. These investigations will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the characteristics and risk factors of developing oropharyngeal dypshagia in patients with Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Pulmonary <b>Disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chronic <b>obstructive</b> {{pulmonary}} <b>disease</b> {{is characterized}} by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, particularly tobacco smoke. Diagnosis of chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> is primarily based on a reduction of forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio < 70 % post-bronchodilators. The characteristic symptoms of chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> are cough, sputum, and dyspnea upon exertion. Based on airflow limitation as measured by spirometry, chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> can be classified as mild, moderate, severe and very severe. Chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> can coexist with asthma, although the inflammation characteristic of chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> is distinct from that of asthma...|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} role of DDAH activity in regulating NO synthesis in vivo was demonstrated using a transgenic DDAH mouse. In this animal, {{the activity of}} DDAH is increased, and plasma ADMA levels are reduced by 50%. The reduction in plasma ADMA {{is associated with a}} significant increase in NOS activity, as plasma and urinary nitrate levels are doubled. The increase in NOS activity translates into a 15mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure in the transgenic mouse. This study provides evidence for the importance of DDAH activity and plasma ADMA levels in the regulation of NO synthesis. Subsequent studies have shown that DDAH transgenic animals also manifest improvements in endothelial regeneration and angiogenesis, and reduced vascular <b>obstructive</b> <b>disease,</b> in association with the reduced plasma levels of ADMA. These findings are consistent with evidence from a number of groups that nitric oxide plays a {{critical role}} in vascular regeneration. By contrast, elevations in ADMA impair angiogenesis. These insights into the role of DDAH in degrading endogenous inhibitors of NOS, and thereby maintaining vascular NO production, may have important implications in vascular health and therapy for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|In this perspective-based article, {{which is}} based on {{findings}} from a comprehensive literature search, we discuss the significant and growing burden of chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> in women worldwide. Chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> now affects both men and women almost equally. Despite this, there remains an outdated perception of chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> as a male-dominated disease. Primary care physicians {{play a central role in}} overseeing the multidisciplinary care of women with chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> Many women with chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> delay seeking medical assistance, due to fear of stigmatization or dismissing symptoms as a 'smoker's cough'. Improving awareness is important to encourage women with symptoms to seek advice earlier. Once women do seek help, primary care physicians need to have knowledge of the nuances of female chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> disease presentation to avoid mis- or delayed diagnosis, both of which are more common in women with chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> than men. Subsequent management should consider gender-specific issues, such as differential incidences of comorbid conditions, potentially higher symptom burden, and a higher risk of exacerbations. Chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> treatment and smoking cessation management should be specifically tailored to the individual woman and reviewed regularly to optimize patient outcomes.

40|$|Abstract Background Inflammation in the airways {{and lung}} {{parenchyma}} underlies fixed airway obstruction in chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> The exact role of smoking as promoting factor of inflammation in chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> is not clear, partly because studies {{often do not}} distinguish between current and ex-smokers. Methods We investigated airway inflammation in sputum and bronchial biopsies of 34 smokers with chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> (9 Global initiative for Chronic <b>Obstructive</b> Lung <b>Disease</b> stage 0, 9 stage I, 10 stage II and 6 stage III) and 26 asymptomatic smokers, and its relationship with past and present smoking habits and airway obstruction. Results Neutrophil percentage, interleukin- 8 and eosinophilic-cationic-protein levels in sputum were higher in chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease</b> (stage I-III) than asymptomatic smokers. Inflammatory cell numbers in bronchial biopsies were similar in both groups. Current smoking correlated positively with macrophages: in bronchial biopsies in both groups, and in sputum in chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> Pack-years smoking correlated positively with biopsy macrophages only in chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> Conclusion Inflammatory effects of current smoking may mask the underlying ongoing inflammatory process pertinent to chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary <b>disease.</b> This may have implications for future studies, which should avoid including mixed populations of smokers and ex-smokers. </p...|$|R
