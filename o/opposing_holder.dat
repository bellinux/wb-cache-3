50|$|The {{protagonist of}} Suikoden II (whose name is {{decided by the}} player {{at the start of}} the game) goes from being a member of a youth brigade in the Highland Kingdom to being the leader of its opposition, the New Alliance Army. In {{acquiring}} one half of the Rune of the Beginning, he is destined to become leader of the newly rebuilt Jowston Army, and also to <b>oppose</b> the <b>holder</b> of the other half of the Rune of the Beginning, Jowy Atreides.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We obtain general {{results on}} the {{stability}} of mixing and rapid mixing (superpolynomial decay of correlations) for hyperbolic flows. Amongst C r Axiom A flows, r ≥ 2, we {{show that there is}} a C 2 -open, C r-dense set of flows for which each nontrivial hyperbolic basic set is rapid mixing. This is the first general result on the stability of rapid mixing (or even mixing) for Axiom A flows that holds in a C r, as <b>opposed</b> to <b>Hölder,</b> topology. 1...|$|R
5000|$|He was Negi Springfield's main rival and comrade in the Negima series, and is {{currently}} heralded as the greatest wizard in the Solar System and the current leader of [...] "Ala Alba", the brigade Negi founded with his students 80 years before. He <b>opposes</b> UQ <b>Holder,</b> claiming that Yukihime was responsible for Negi's disappearance. However, Fate claims {{that there is a}} way to save Negi and the fate of the entire Solar System depends on it. To do so, he claims that he needs Tōta's cooperation but instead became the target of Tōta's hatred after revealing that he was the one responsible for the death of Tōta's parents, though this changes as Tōta begins to suspect that Fate is hiding something.|$|R
25|$|With their {{position}} secure, the Democrats next tackled the state debt. Many Democrats from the upcountry, led by General Martin Gary, who had developed the Edgefield Plan for targeted violence {{to take back}} the state, pushed for the entire state debt to be canceled, but Gary was <b>opposed</b> by Charleston <b>holders</b> of the bonds. A compromise moderated by Wade Hampton was achieved and by October 1882, the state debt was reduced to $6.5 million.|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of co-creation and co-communication are emerging concepts in the brand management literature that invoke multiple stakeholder interactions. However, this literature {{does not consider}} {{the impact of the}} com- plex ecosystems that lie behind both the brand and its stakeholders in order to create synergistic outcomes. By analyzing LEGO's relations with four stakeholder ecosystems we find that successful co-creation outcomes are dependent on value and cultural complementarities, but that these outcomes can be jeopardized when there are not also complementarities between the cultures in the process of direct firm-stakeholder interaction. To maximize co-creation the firm should remain open to input from all stakeholders, because even <b>opposing</b> stake- <b>holders</b> at the periphery of the ecosystem can contribute with valuable adjustments at the core.

5000|$|There {{is also no}} {{evidence}} that the two holes could have been bitten at the same time. The tooth spans were analyzed by all taphonomists concerned to see if any animals could bite two or more such holes at once. No match could be found to any known animals. If a match had been found, it could have been cited as prima facie evidence that the holes were animal-made. This was noted by Turk in his book and was also noted from the <b>opposing</b> hypothesis <b>holders</b> Nowell and Chase in their article in the August/October 1998 issue of Current Anthropology. Nowell wrote that holes in the specimen [...] "were almost certainly made sequentially rather than simultaneously and that the distance between them {{has nothing to do with}} the distance between any two teeth in a wolf's jaw." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of the 69 {{cities in}} the United Kingdom, the City of London is among the 30 that have Lord Mayors (or, in Scotland, Lords Provost). The Lord Mayor is {{entitled}} to the style The Right Honourable; the same privilege extends only to the Lord Mayors of York, Cardiff and Belfast, and to the Lords Provost of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The style, however, is used when referring to the office as <b>opposed</b> to the <b>holder</b> thereof; thus, [...] "The Rt Hon Lord Mayor of London" [...] would be correct, while [...] "The Rt Hon Jeffrey Mountevans" [...] would be incorrect. The latter prefix applies only to Privy Counsellors.|$|R
5000|$|When {{incumbent}} State Representative Nancy C. Detert {{was unable}} to seek re-election in 2006 due to term limits, Holder ran in the Republican primary to succeed her in the 70th District, which included most of western Sarasota County, stretching from Englewood to Siesta Key, and faced Rory Dubin, Jon Kleiber, and Elizabeth Cuevas-Neunder. He spent nearly $400,000 {{of his own money}} on advertising, [...] "leading some people to accuse Holder...of trying to buy the office and of ignorance of local issues." [...] Holder emerged victorious in the Republican primary, winning 42% of the vote, and moved on to the general election, where he engaged in a contentious campaign with the Democratic nominee, attorney David Shapiro. Though Holder and Shapiro pledged to run positive campaigns, a group supporting Holder, People for a Better Florida Fund, which received a sizable donation from Holder’s stepmother, attacked Shapiro for being a [...] "millionaire trial lawyer" [...] and for <b>opposing</b> tort reform. <b>Holder</b> narrowly won over Shapiro, winning 51% of the vote to Shapiro’s 49%, a margin of just 756 votes. In 2008, retired dentist Sam Rosenfeld received the Democratic nomination to challenger Holder’s bid for re-election, and though Democrats were hopeful that Rosenfeld could defeat Holder, given the closeness of his initial election, Holder easily dispatched his opponent, winning re-election with 61% of the vote. When Holder ran for re-election in 2010, his Democratic opponent, Nancy Feehan, attacked him over his vote [...] "to allow the governor and cabinet to permit drilling from 3 to 10 miles from shore," [...] which had particular resonance given the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which caused Holder to change his mind on offshore oil drilling. However, despite this fact, Holder managed to repeat his 2008 victory, defeating Feehan with 61% of the vote.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of everyday financial instruments {{is an important}} dimension of modern life, and credit cards {{are considered to be}} the main instruments and facilitators of spending in modern economies. Together with the Internet, which facilitates the spending process, credit cards have become essential instruments of spending. In response to this, and due to the expansion of Islamic banking and finance, the Islamic equivalent of credit cards (Islamic credit cards or ICCs) have been engineered with their own sophisticated financing methods alongside conventional credit cards (CCCs). Malaysia is one of the pioneering countries in Islamic finance and has developed a number of ICC products. This study aims to analyse the two main aspects of credit cards, namely, the selection criteria and the impact of credit cards in Malaysia in general, as well as the difference between ICCs and CCCs in particular. The selection criteria are investigated in terms of various factors, including those that explain the first motivation for credit card holding, selection factors influenced by the credit cards’ embedded features, the difference between the satisfaction and the loyalty level of CCC holders as compared to ICC holders, the customers’ perceptions of ICCs, an investigation into whether ICCs are perceived as being inferior to CCCs, religious commitments of ICC <b>holders</b> as <b>opposed</b> to CCC <b>holders,</b> and how the socio-demographic characteristics may have deterministic power over the holding of ICCs and CCCs. The impact of credit cards is investigated through their usage as well as the perceptions of the credit card holders. In conducting the research, this study assembled primary data from Malaysia through a questionnaire survey with 507 participants. In addition, interviews with financiers or bankers, Shari’ah scholars, economists, and cardholders were conducted to verify the results that were established through a quantitative data analysis of the questionnaire. The findings of this study, inter alia, indicate that Malaysian cardholders are found as perceiving credit card selection factors not much differently than individuals in other nations. ‘Protection’ and ‘convenience’ appear to be {{on the top of the}} selection list, while ‘reputation’ is in the lowest rank. Furthermore, in investigating the selection attributes, ICC holders were found to value religious factors more highly than in comparison with CCC holders. It was also revealed that ICC holders were less satisfied with having a credit card but they were more loyal than CCC holders. Interestingly, the results also revealed that ICC holders perceived ICCs to be more Islamic than CCC holders, although, in an overall evaluation, ICCs were perceived as inferior to CCCs by ICC holders. It should be noted that the religious commitments among the ICC holders were also higher than those of the CCC holders. Furthermore, the ‘ethnicity’ and ‘religion’ of the socio-demographic variables appear to be significantly related to the holding type. Therefore, the results reveal that religious factors are more influential in the selection process of the ICC holders as compared to CCC holders. In terms of determining the impact of credit cards, the study indicates five determining factors for Malaysian revolving credit cardholders, namely, ‘education’, ‘income’, ‘credit behaviour’, ‘car loan’, and ‘number of credit cards held’. A further analysis to determine the impact between sixteen usage and perception variables with holding type indicates that ICC holders suffer a less negative impact for the use of credit cards in comparison with CCC holders. There is also a higher agreement among respondents in believing that credit card companies use aggressive strategies and misleading advertisements. Importantly, the results also indicate that there is, in reality, no obvious difference between ICC and CCC issuers in marketing their credit cards. It should also be noted that the respondents indicate rationality in their thinking, as the majority admit that widespread credit card debt is due to their self-attitude. This study is useful for various parties, including customers, to examine how credit cards can create financial difficulty. It will also aid financial issuers in understanding the attitudes and perceptions of cardholders, hence, allowing a better strategy in structuring their credit cards. Policy makers, on the other hand, will be able to use it as a guide in implementing policies to curb credit card debt from proliferating. ...|$|R
