40|$|Wage {{differentials}} between {{mothers and}} childless women are estimated correcting for the selectivity bias resulting from two double selection processes: firstly, the motherhood decision and the employment decision, and secondly the motherhood decision {{and the decision}} to be employed in a <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> job. We use Dutch data on women’s wages and construct an indicator for <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> jobs. Our estimations indicate that the motherhood decision is strongly correlated with both employment and having a <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> job. This suggests that ignoring these correlations will lead to inconsistent parameter estimations of wage equations. The selectivity corrected estimation of women’s wage differentials indicate that {{a large part of}} the wage differential is composed by discrimination compared to estimations without correction for selectivity. ...|$|R
