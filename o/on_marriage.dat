5|$|The debate, again {{including}} {{contributions from}} Justice Minister Michael McDowell, {{took place in}} February 2007. All speakers supported civil unions for same-sex couples and complimented Deputy Howlin on the bill. One expressed reservations about adoption. Minister McDowell claimed that the bill violated the constitutional provisions <b>on</b> <b>marriage</b> and the family. Government speakers said that civil unions needed to be introduced but that more time was needed {{to take account of}} the ongoing Supreme Court case and investigation work in the Department of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings <b>on</b> <b>marriage</b> call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E

5|$|Cope and Marsh {{came from}} very {{different}} backgrounds. Cope {{was born into}} a wealthy and influential Quaker family based in Philadelphia. Although his father wanted his son to work as a farmer, Cope distinguished himself as a naturalist. In 1864, already a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Cope became a professor of zoology at Haverford College and joined Ferdinand Hayden on his expeditions west. In contrast, Marsh would have grown up poor, the son of a struggling family in Lockport, New York, {{had it not been for}} the benefaction of his uncle, philanthropist George Peabody. Marsh persuaded his uncle to build the Peabody Museum of Natural History, placing Marsh as head of the museum. Combined with the inheritance he received from Peabody upon his death in 1869, Marsh was financially comfortable (although, partly because of Peabody's stern views <b>on</b> <b>marriage,</b> Marsh would remain a lifelong bachelor).|$|E
5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter <b>on</b> <b>marriage,</b> which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Mani again {{teamed up}} with Ram Gopal Varma to provide the {{screenplay}} for the latter's Telugu film Gaayam, a socio-politico film loosely based on The Godfather. In 1995, Mani returned to Tamil language drama through Bombay starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala, which {{told the story of}} a Hindu-Muslim couple {{in the midst of the}} 1993 religious Bombay riots and bombings. It was also the first Indian film to focus <b>on</b> <b>marriage</b> between Hindu and Muslim people. The film met with controversy and censorship upon release, was subsequently dubbed into Hindi and was commercially successful and appreciated by critics. It won a number of awards, such as Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Special Award from the Political Film Society, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem International Film Festival and the Gala Award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.|$|E
30|$|Cross-nativity and cross-racial {{marriages are}} more likely to end in divorce. Intact marriages, and marriages that are {{expected}} to endure, usually involve more specialization. Since we focus <b>on</b> <b>marriages</b> that are continuing, we may have selected marriages where the division of labor is better established and higher than all <b>marriages</b> <b>on</b> average.|$|R

40|$|England’s post-Reformation {{demographic}} {{regime has}} been characterized as ‘low pressure’. Yet the evidence hitherto {{for the presence of}} a preventive check, defined as the short-run response of marriage and births to variations in living standards, is rather weak. New evidence in this paper strengthens the case for the preventive check in both medieval and early modern England. We invoke manorial data to argue the case for a preventive check <b>on</b> <b>marriages</b> in the middle ages. Our analysis of the post- 1540 period, based on parish-level rather than aggregate data, finds evidence for a preventive check <b>on</b> <b>marriages</b> and births.

5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated <b>on</b> <b>marriage,</b> which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not so sure that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis <b>on</b> <b>marriage</b> {{as a way to}} perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, who was responsible for choosing their husband; the bride had little say in this decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, women often married relatives. This was especially the case of women with no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E

5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence <b>on</b> <b>marriage</b> of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
