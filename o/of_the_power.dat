5|$|Childs-Irving was {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant built in Arizona, and in 1920 it was supplying as much as 70percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> used by Phoenix.

5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> stations, other than {{a small number of}} bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the closure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{stations}} at Stella, {{as well as}} those at Dunston and Blyth (in 1981 and 2001 respectively), the northern part of North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for electricity.

Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up {{for the value of}} their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
