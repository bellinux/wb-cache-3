On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on the practice field lights, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|Following Dana's murder, {{the killer}} uses her {{cellphone}} {{to call the}} girls. Figuring out that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her.

Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable {{for at least two}} hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had gotten killed by a falling icicle. Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive.|$|E

5|$|Seward was an expansionist, {{and sought}} {{opportunities}} to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) {{as a financial}} liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> {{there was no time}} to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.|$|E

25|$|Lands of the north, {{formerly}} open {{to summer}} seasonal grazing, {{began to be}} taken and transformed into farms. Hence in late spring tribes of pastoral Berbers arrived at what they considered their customary grazing lands, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that the land was now entirely owned by another, a planter, who refused them permission to graze and water their herds. The new, often large, agricultural operations produced grain for export, which quickly became highly profitable. The two opposing sides were firmly committed to their own interests.|$|E

A superb conversationalist {{known for his}} disarming charm and excellent social and people skills, he had {{an uncanny ability to}} establish rapport and win people over and achieve consensus. Sharaf could be obdurate, refusing to comply with the instructions of international border officials to postpone his travel till daylight and insisting on his right, as a diplomat, to free and unfettered movement across borders, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> of the impossibility of crossing the border at night due to dangers associated with the presence of active mine fields.|$|E
25|$|The next year, 1923, Soviet {{authorities}} {{were eager to}} expand the Toikino experiment of 1922. The Soviet People's Commissariat of Agriculture offered a large tract of fertile land in the Kuban region, {{just north of the}} Black Sea for another model farm. Working with the Friends of Soviet Russia organization, Hal Ware organized a party of 40 to make the trip, including agricultural specialists, a doctor, and a nurse. Ware arrived in Soviet Russia to inspect the land designated for the project <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> by Soviet officials that the deal was off — local peasants had begun to allocate the land reserved for the project amongst themselves. An alternative site in the North Caucasus was hastily located, but the project was delayed.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{during the}} early 1960s, there were several scandals in California {{involving}} county assessors. These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with tax bills to match. These scandals led {{to the passage of}} AB 80 in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid-double-digit percentage increase in assessment for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced an immediate and drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.|$|E

Standing beside him was a proud father who had dragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> return on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible.

2500|$|In issue #2 Miller's gritty {{style of}} {{dialogue}} led {{the title character}} to introduce himself to Grayson as [...] "the Goddamn Batman". The phrase {{went on to become}} something of a meme among comic book fans for its perceived comedic value, and has, since its sudden fame, been repeated at least once in nearly every subsequent issue of the comic. According to reviewer Brett Weiss, the line [...] "drew derision from fans and critics alike". DC Comics would even later parody the line's fame in its Superman/Batman comic by having a super deformed Batman introduce himself to the 'canon' Batman by saying [...] "I'm the goshdarn Batm–", <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> swiftly <b>told</b> <b>to</b> shut up. Another infamous element of the story was Grayson frequently being referred to as [...] "Dick Grayson, Age 12", no matter what the circumstance.|$|R
25|$|Madeleine's body {{is found}} by her blind {{mother and the}} Abbé in the laundry vat. The Abbé is devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is {{captured}} and imprisoned inside an iron dummy. The Abbé blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and prods him into a fury. The Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> she had died a virgin. The Abbé has the Marquis' tongue cut out as punishment for his involvement, but is riddled with remorse and physically punishes himself. The Abbé then has a dream in which Madeleine comes alive and they have sex, but ultimately it ends with him holding her corpse. The Marquis' health declines severely, but he remains perverse as ever, decorating his dungeon with a story, using faeces as ink. As the Marquis lies dying, the Abbé reads him the last rites and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that he understands that his daughter is strong and can take care of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E
