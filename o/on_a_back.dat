25|$|To this day, {{the most}} {{traditional}} huipils {{are made with}} hand woven cloth <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> strap loom. However, the introduction of commercial fabric made this costly and many indigenous women stopped making this fabric, or making simpler versions. By the early 1800s, women began to wear undecorated huipils or European style blouses. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, most Maya women had forgotten the technique of brocade weaving entirely.|$|E
25|$|As the killer's epithet implies, {{the victims}} usually were {{attacked}} with an axe, which often {{belonged to the}} victims themselves. In most cases, a panel <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> door of a home was removed by a chisel, which were both left on the floor near the door, followed by an attack on {{one or more of}} the residents with either an axe or straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims' homes.|$|E

25|$|Col. Kelley {{devised a}} two-prong {{attack against the}} Confederate force in Philippi, {{approved}} by Gen. Morris on his arrival in Grafton on June 1. The principal advance would be 1,600 men led by Kelley himself, and would include six companies of his own regiment, nine of the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment under Col. Robert H. Milroy, and six of the 16th Ohio Infantry. In order to deceive the enemy into thinking the objective was Harpers Ferry, they departed by train to the east. They disembarked at the small village of Thornton and marched south <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> road {{on the same side}} of the river as Philippi, intending to arrive at the rear of the town.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the International Skating Union {{enacted a}} rule stating that a skater may perform {{each type of}} triple only once, or twice {{if one of them}} is {{incorporated}} into a combination or sequence. For a set of jumps to be considered a combination, each jump must take off from the landing edge of the previous jump, with no steps, turns, or change of edge in between jumps. Toe loops and loops are commonly performed as the second or third jump in a combination because they take off from the back outside edge of the landing foot, or skating leg. To perform a salchow or flip on the back end of a combination, a half loop (which is actually a full rotation, but lands <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> inside edge of the landing leg) may be used as a connecting jump. In contrast, jump sequences are sets of jumps which may be linked by non-listed jumps or hops. Sequences are worth 80% of what the same jumps executed in combination would be worth.|$|E

500|$|On October 8, 2012, {{production}} {{returned to}} Sydney with filming on Erskine Street near Cockle Bay. The following week, the film shot in Parramatta, which doubled as a Japanese city. Also in October, Mangold {{revealed that the}} film follows the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, saying, [...] "Where this film sits in the universe of the films is after them all. Jean Grey is gone, most of the X-Men are disbanded or gone, so there’s {{a tremendous sense of}} isolation for [...]" [...] Mangold later stated that in the fight scenes, [...] "there's an urgency and a kind of intensity and hand to hand physicality that I hope is a little different than everything else out there." [...] On October 25, 2012 production relocated to Sydney Olympic Park in western Sydney. The set was made into a Japanese village draped in snow with filming beginning on November 1, 2012. [...] On November 10, 2012, filming took place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> street in Surry Hills. The set, constructed on Brisbane St., was transformed to look like a Japanese street with Japanese signage and vehicles scattered throughout. Principal photography concluded on November 21, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Edgeworth devoted {{considerable}} {{effort to}} insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all {{schools of thought}} in economics. [...] While {{at the helm of}} The Economic Journal, he published several articles criticizing the mathematical rigor of rival researchers, [...] including Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, a noted skeptic of mathematical economics. [...] The articles focused <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> and forth over tax incidence and responses by producers. [...] Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied. [...] Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous. [...] Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation. [...] He suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions. [...] Harold Hotelling later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a [...] "diminution of price {{as a result of the}} tax") could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} the 2016 NBA draft, LeVert {{authored}} {{an open letter to}} NBA general managers to assure them of his resiliency {{in the face of all}} of his doubters due to his injury. On June 23, LeVert was selected with the 20th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Indiana Pacers. He became Michigan's fifth first-round draft selection since 2013 and the fourth player drafted from Michigan's 2012 entering class. His rights were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets on July 7, in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Dr. O'Malley, who had performed LeVert's most recent foot surgery, was on the Brooklyn Nets medical staff at the time of the trade. On July 14, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nets. LeVert missed the 2016 NBA Summer League as well as preseason and resumed practicing near the beginning of the regular season. He began the season sidelined and still rehabbing his injury. He was cleared to play on December 4. He made his professional debut on December 7 against the Denver Nuggets. Although he went 0-of-3 from the field, he posted 4 rebounds and 3 steals in 9 minutes of play, becoming the first Net to post 3 steals in his debut since Chris Childs in 1994. Levert entered at the start of the second quarter and posted 3 steals and 3 rebounds in 5:15 of play before halftime. LeVert scored his first NBA points on December 10 against the San Antonio Spurs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> door reverse layup assisted by Brook Lopez. LeVert posted double digit scoring for the first time with 12 points on December 30 against the Washington Wizards and former Michigan one-on-one training partner Burke's season-high 27 points. On February 3, Levert made his first NBA start against former Michigan teammate Robinson and the Indiana Pacers. On April 6 against the Orlando Magic, LeVert posted his first 20-point performance. Despite missing a large portion of the season, LeVert almost made the NBA All-Rookie team, finishing 12 in the voting for the 10-man team.|$|E

2500|$|The Deer Hunter began {{principal}} photography on June 20, 1977. This was {{the first}} feature film depicting the Vietnam War to be filmed on location in Thailand. All scenes were shot on location (no sound stages). [...] "There was discussion about shooting the film <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> lot, but the material demanded more realism," [...] says Spikings. The cast and crew viewed large amounts of news footage from the war to ensure authenticity. The film was shot {{over a period of}} six months. The Clairton scenes comprise footage shot in eight different towns in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Ohio. The initial budget of the film was $8.5 million.|$|E
2500|$|The Godzilla roar was revamped for the movie. According to Edwards, sound {{designer}} Erik Aadahl improved {{on the original}} sound effect provided by Toho. Aadahl and fellow {{sound designer}} Ethan Van Der Ryn spent six months over the three-year production getting the roar right. Using microphones that could record sound inaudible to humans, the team found sounds to match the initial shriek and the finishing bellow. The new roar retains the musical key and cadence of the roar, going from a C to a D. The final version was the 50th the team produced. The pair tested the roar <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> lot at Warner Bros., using a tour speaker array for The Rolling Stones, and estimated {{that it could be}} heard [...] away. In IMAX theatres, the roar was integrated into the sound of the [...] "Welcome to IMAX" [...] sequence shown before Godzilla showings.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein {{dedicated}} his 1958 novel Methuselah's Children [...] "To Edward E. Smith, PhD".) Heinlein {{reported that}} E. E. Smith perhaps took his [...] "unrealistic" [...] heroes from life, citing {{as an example}} the extreme competence of the hero of Spacehounds of IPC. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports {{that he began to}} suspect Smith might be a sort of [...] "superman" [...] when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction—a process apparently improvised on the spot.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews upon {{release and}} currently holds a 91% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating {{on the website}} Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that the film [...] "provides a good time, high style, a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking". The New York Times chief critic of the era, Vincent Canby, pointed out that [...] "had Dame Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express been made into a movie 40 years ago (when it was published here as [...] "Murder on the Calais Coach"), it would have been photographed in black-and-white <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>back</b> lot in Burbank or Culver City, with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players. Its running time would have been around 67 minutes and {{it could have been a}} very respectable B-picture. Murder on the Orient Express wasn't made into a movie 40 years ago, and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened yesterday at the Coronet, you may be both surprised and glad it wasn't. An earlier adaptation could have interfered with plans to produce this terrifically entertaining super-valentine to a kind of whodunit that may well be one of the last fixed points in our inflationary universe." ...|$|E
