5|$|Turbines {{offered more}} power than {{reciprocating}} engines for the same volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.|$|E
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment {{showed that there}} is no relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Holding such {{conservative}} views, Saint-Saëns was out {{of sympathy}} – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> labels argent are a peculiarly royal symbol, {{and that}} eldest sons outside {{the royal family}} should use labels of a {{different}} colour, usually gules.|$|E

2500|$|It has <b>often</b> been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{she once}} stated, [...] "I can get any woman {{away from any}} man" [...] {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} to substantiate this claim.|$|R
50|$|It has <b>often</b> been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> forms (kata) are the {{backbone}} of the martial arts. Nevertheless, different schools and styles put a varying amount of emphasis upon their practice.|$|R
25|$|Although Paul has <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> his {{ultimate}} goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and eliminate the income tax, the Plan to Restore America does not address that specific goal.|$|E
25|$|The race {{started at}} 6am with {{only four of}} the 12 {{entrants}} on the track. Although it is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the first six-day was a non-stop, no-sleeping event that ran without pause for six days, in fact riders joined in when they chose and slept as they wished.|$|E
25|$|Hubble <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Leavitt {{deserved}} the Nobel for her work. |title=Mile Markers to the Galaxies |date=19 November 2009 |work=One-Minute Astronomer |accessdate=25 February 2011}} Gösta Mittag-Leffler of the Swedish Academy of Sciences had begun paperwork on her nomination in 1924, {{only to learn}} that she had died of cancer three years earlier (the Nobel prize cannot be awarded posthumously).|$|E

5|$|Mo {{is closed}} about her {{personal}} relationships and she <b>often</b> has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> having a boyfriend {{is not her}} priority in life. She also stated that personal relationships should remain private.|$|R
25|$|The Mustaali sects are {{the most}} {{traditional}} of the three main groups of Ismāʿīlī, maintaining rituals such as prayer and fasting more consistently with the practices of other Shi'i sects. It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they resemble Sunni Islam even more than Twelvers do, though this would hold true for matters of the exterior rituals (zahir) only, with little bearing on doctrinal or theological differences.|$|E
25|$|How {{important}} {{the concept was}} can be understood from how the idea that some local phenomenon may be somehow linked to an absolute and sacred object found extensive application in the medieval and early modern periods. It was <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> temple lands in Japan were local emanations of Buddhist paradises or that an artisan's work was one with the sacred actions of an Indian Buddha, such as Nevin Koshy.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Galileo {{thought the}} curve of a hanging chain was parabolic. In his Two New Sciences (1638), Galileo says that a hanging cord is an {{approximate}} parabola, and he correctly observes that this approximation improves as the curvature gets smaller and is almost exact when the elevation is less than 45°. That the curve followed by a chain is not a parabola was proven by Joachim Jungius (1587–1657); this result was published posthumously in 1669.|$|E
5000|$|It has <b>often</b> been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> [...] "there {{was not one}} drop of Egyptian {{blood in}} the Ptolemaic line", and that the Romans, in all their anti-Cleopatra propaganda, {{made no mention of}} any illegitimacy against her.|$|R

25|$|Jacek Dukaj: one of {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} writers of the 1990s and 2000s, and winner of many awards. He is known for the complexity of his books, and it is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a single short story by Dukaj contains more ideas than many other writers put into their books in their lifetime. His books are generally hard sf; popular themes include the technological singularity, nanotechnology and virtual reality. Among his favourite writers is Australian Greg Egan, and Dukaj's books bear some resemblance to Egan's.|$|E
25|$|Warner Bros. had {{originally}} picked George Jessel for the role, {{as he had}} starred in the Broadway play. When Sam Warner decided to make The Jazz Singer a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed to put it over. He told Jessel {{that he would have}} to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner to replace him with Jolson. Jessel never got over it and <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Warner gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{twelve years}} elapsed between {{the second and}} third acts of Siegfried, but this is an exaggeration. While it is true that eleven years and twenty-nine weeks passed between the {{completion}} of the developed draft of Act II {{and the beginning of the}} preliminary draft of Act III, Wagner devoted more than a year of this so-called hiatus to the composition of Siegfried, completing the fair copy of Act I, drawing up both the full score and fair copy of Act II, and making sketches for Act III.|$|E
25|$|In {{medieval and}} modern {{heraldry}} eagles are <b>often</b> <b>said</b> to indicate <b>that</b> the armiger (person bearing the arms) was courageous, {{a man of}} action and judicious.|$|R
50|$|It has <b>often</b> been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> many {{communities}} in northern latitudes {{are living in}} denial of their northern climate. As evidence, {{they point to the}} fact that many northern cities are designed {{in much the same way}} that southern/warm-climate cities are designed.|$|R
50|$|The record {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of styles within the electronica spectrum, including techno, breakbeats, trip hop and drum 'n' bass. David Holmes has produced many film scores, and it has <b>often</b> been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> his studio albums have a cinematic feel to them.|$|R
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding of how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{respondents}} who {{never used the}} library cited embarrassment or {{lack of knowledge about}} available information as reasons. Even those that did frequent the library <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they were too embarrassed to ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from those who did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was needed to address these perceptions. She also found that those {{respondents who}} regularly used a college or university library had a more positive experience finding needed information than those who used only the public library.|$|E
25|$|De Divina Proportione, a three-volume work by Luca Pacioli, was {{published}} in 1509. Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, was known mostly as a mathematician, {{but he was also}} trained and keenly interested in art. De Divina Proportione explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the Vitruvian system of rational proportions. Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. De Divina Proportione contains illustrations of regular solids by Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.|$|E
60|$|It has <b>often</b> been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the snake's rattle is for {{warning to}} birds and other animals; {{but this is}} now {{known to be a}} mistake, for when a snake rattles, it strikes its victim almost at the same time, if it has a chance.|$|R

50|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>said</b> humorously <b>that</b> the area's {{culture is}} agriculture, {{with plenty of}} rice cultivation. Some modern changes are apparent. Cultivation of Jasmine flowers, coconut, arecanut, {{sugarcane}} and poultry farming is on the rise. The landscape of Belle has significant natural beauty {{with a lot of}} mountains and forests.|$|R
