5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2009–10 season, Djurgården participated in the Nordic Trophy pre-season tournament. In the second game, Josefson scored a hat trick and added two assists against the Malmö Redhawks. At the end of the group stage, Josefson was the scoring leader with five goals and seven points. He scored his first points for the regular season, three assists, in the Elitserien premiere away against HV71. Djurgården lost the game 7–6, but on 20 October, Josefson would get his revenge when he scored the game-winning goal in the 3–2 victory over HV71 20. This was also his first goal of the regular season. Josefson missed six Elitserien games due to the World Junior Hockey Championship, but was back in the roster against Timrå IK on 9 January. He recorded an assist against Rögle BK on 30 January, which was his 17th point of the season, putting him ahead of last season's total. At the end of the regular season, Josefson had scored 8 goals and 20 points in 43 games. The 2009–10 playoffs were Josefson's first Elitserien playoffs, and he played almost every game missing the first two semifinal games against Linköpings HC due to illness. Djurgården lost the finals 4–2 to HV71. Josefson re-signed with Djurgården for another year on 27 April. Despite this and an <b>oral</b> <b>guarantee</b> the club received from Josefson's agent Peter Wallén that Josefson would stay, Josefson signed with the New Jersey Devils on 14 May 2010.|$|E
50|$|On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an Enabling Act passed by all {{parties in the}} Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the Centre Party, led by Prelate Ludwig Kaas, by issuing <b>oral</b> <b>guarantees</b> of the party's continued existence and {{the autonomy of the}} Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.|$|R
5000|$|Hitler {{offered the}} {{possibility}} of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the states, or the churches if granted emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: [...] "It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace". Hitler offered Kaas <b>oral</b> <b>guarantees</b> of the Centre Party's continued existence, autonomy of the Church, her educational and cultural institutions. Kaas {{was aware of the}} doubtful nature of such guarantees, but told members to support the bill, given the [...] "precarious state of the party". A number opposed the chairman's course, among them former Chancellors Brüning and Joseph Wirth and former minister Adam Stegerwald. Brüning called the Act [...] "the most monstrous resolution ever demanded of a parliament", and was sceptical about Kaas' efforts. The Centre Party, having obtained promises of non-interference in religion, joined with conservatives in voting for the Act (only the Social Democrats voted against). Hoffman wrote that the Centre Party and Bavarian People's Party, along with other groups between the Nazis and the Social-Democrats [...] "voted for their own emasculation in the paradoxical hope of saving their existence thereby". Hitler immediately set about abolishing the powers of the states, the existence of non-Nazi political parties and organisations. The Act, allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenberg remained President. The Act did not infringe upon the powers of the President, and Hitler would not fully achieve full dictatorial power until after the death of Hindenburg in August 1934. Hindenburg remained Commander and Chief of the military and retained the power to negotiate foreign treaties. On 28 March the German Bishops' Conference conditionally revised prohibition of Nazi Party membership.|$|R

500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several <b>oral</b> independence <b>guarantees</b> to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|R
40|$|Three galenic {{formulations}} of cefixime (tablet, syrup and dry suspension) containing 200 mg each {{were compared with}} respect to their relative bioavailability in twelve healthy volunteers. All three formulations showed reliable absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations were reached after 3. 3 - 3. 5 h, mean terminal half lives were 2. 9 - 3. 1 h. 18 - 24 % of the dose administered were recovered unchanged in the urine. Best bioavailability was obtained with the dry suspension (AUC 0 -infinity = 25. 8 +/- 7. 0 micrograms/ml h; Cmax = 3. 4 +/- 0. 9 microgram/ml), followed by the tablet (AUC 0 -infinity = 20. 9 +/- 8. 1 micrograms/ml h; Cmax = 3. 0 +/- 1. 0 micrograms/ml) and the syrup which is based on triglycerides (AUC 0 -infinity = 17. 8 +/- 5. 9 micrograms/ml h; Cmax = 2. 4 +/- 0. 7 micrograms/ml). The statistical analysis resulted in bioinequivalence between dry suspension and syrup. It is concluded that best bioavailability of cefixime after <b>oral</b> administration is <b>guaranteed</b> when taken in an "aqueous medium" either as dry suspension or as tablet with "plenty of liquid"...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{immediate}} release dosage forms involve compressing {{the powder}} with a disintegrating agent that enables rapid disintegration and dissolution upon oral ingestion. Among 3 D printing technologies, the {{fused deposition modelling}} (FDM) 3 D printing technique has considerable potential for patient-specific dosage form. However, the use of FDM 3 D printing in tablet manufacturing requires large portion of polymer, which slows down drug release through erosion and diffusion mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} the use of a novel design approach of caplets with perforating channels to accelerate drug release from 3 D printed tablets. This strategy has been implemented using a caplet design with perforating channels of increasing width (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8 or 1. 0 mm) and variable length, and alignment (parallel or at right angle to tablet long axis). Hydrochlorothiazide (BCS class IV drug) was chosen as model drug as enhanced dissolution rate is vital to <b>guarantee</b> <b>oral</b> bioavailability. The inclusion of channels exhibited an increase in the surface are/volume ratio, however, the release pattern was also influenced by the width and the length of the channel. A channel width≥ 0. 6 mm deemed critical to meet the USP criteria of immediate release products. Shorter multiple channels (8. 6 mm) were more efficient at accelerating drug release than longer channels (18. 2 mm) despite having comparable surface area/mass ratio. This behaviour may be linked to the reduced flow resistance within the channels and the faster fragmentation during dissolution of these tablets. In conclusion, the width and length of the channel should be carefully considered in addition to surface area/mass when optimizing drug release from 3 D printed designs. The incorporation of short channels can be adopted in the designs of dosage forms, implants or stents to enhance the release rate of eluting drug from rich polymeric structures.
