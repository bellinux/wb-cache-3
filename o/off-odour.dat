In this paper the analytical resolution {{of a complex}} <b>off-odour</b> problem is described. Identification of the catty odour as the mesityl oxide-hydrogen sulphide adduct 4 -methyl- 4 -mercaptopentan- 2 -one is followed by investigating {{the formation of the}} <b>off-odour</b> with the aid of different model experiments. It is pointed out that the ethylene ionomer material that is used for the sealing layer of the multilayer packaging film has some dehydration property for diacetone alcohol, which was found as a residual solvent in the film material in question. Probably this pathway seems most likely to be responsible for the <b>off-odour...</b>|$|E

The contaminants in question had thus been undetected by the in-line detection devices (so-called 'sniffers') {{that are supposed to}} reject misused bottles. GC-MS analysis was carried out on the headspace of 31 returned products and their corresponding reference products, and chromatograms were compared to find the possible <b>off-odour</b> compounds. Substances believed to be responsible for the organoleptic change were 2 -methoxynaphthalene (10 bottles), dimethyl disulfide (4), anethole (3), petroleum products (4), ethanol with isoamyl alcohol (1) and a series of ethers (1). The mouldy/musty odour (5 bottles) was caused by trichloroanisole in one instance. In some cases, the origins of the off-odours are believed to be previous consumer misuse of food products (liquorice-flavoured alcohol, home-made alcohol containing fusel oil) or non-food products (cleaning products, petroleum products, oral moist snuff and others). The results also apply to 1. 5 -litre recyclable PET bottles, since {{the nature and extent of}} consumer misuse can be expected to be similar for the two bottle types...|$|E

To this aim, an alternative use of fining agents (activated charcoal, PVPP and zeolite) was evaluated. Two levels of ethylphenol contamination were considered: a naturally low contaminated red wine and the same wine spiked with 4 -EP and 4 -EG. The impact of the treatments on desirable aroma volatiles, polyphenols and colour was also evaluated. The effectiveness in diminishing the intensity of the phenolic <b>off-odour</b> was assessed by descriptive sensory analysis. The activated charcoal and PVPP significantly decreased the concentrations of 4 -ethylguaiacol and 4 -ethylphenol in the naturally contaminated wine, while none of the tested fining agent was effective in the spiked one. Polyphenols and colour were slightly affected, to the same extent for the two treatments. Charcoal and PVPP additions negatively impacted the concentration of the aroma volatiles, especially esters, with the activated charcoal achieving a higher decrease.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if storage at - 80 °C prevents <b>off-odour</b> formation from oxidative fatty acid degradation, as previously observed for storage at - 19 °C. This was carried out on milk from mothers being supplemented with fish oil, as well as on milk from those receiving no supplementation (control group). The rationale for this approach was that human milk fatty acid profiles have previously been shown to be highly influenced by maternal fatty acid dietary intake. Also, (poly) unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to be the precursors for <b>off-odour</b> generation during storage at - 19 °C. Therefore, determination of aroma marker odourants originating from unsaturated fatty acids was performed on milk from both groups that had been stored at - 80 °C, showing that, unlike the previously reported dramatic flavour changes in human milk stored at - 19 °C, aroma profiles of milk from both groups remained generally unmodified after storage at - 80 °C...|$|E

Oxidation stability (TBARS), instrumental color, metmyoglobin formation, psychrotrophic flora, and sensory attributes (<b>off-odour</b> and discoloration) were measured at four-day intervals. Rosemary and, to a lesser extent, carnosine (both with ascorbic acid) were very effective in inhibiting both metmyoglobin formation and lipid oxidation, thus stabilizing red meat color and retarding <b>off-odour</b> development. These effects were most noticeable in patties subject to lighting during display, either with the standard fluorescent or with the low-UV color-balanced lamp.

40|$|The end {{of shelf}} life of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce packed in {{modified}} atmosphere (MA) {{is determined by}} its visual quality and by its microbial load. The total microbial load should not exceed 6 – 7 log CFU g− 1 mesophilic counting and be free of human pathogens. Not much is known about specific interactions between the levels of specific spoilage micro-organisms and the sensorial quality attributes of the fresh-cut product. We studied the changes in sensorial quality attributes and the growth and population dynamics of microorganisms in three independent batches of MA packed fresh-cut iceberg lettuce stored at 7 °C. The sensorial quality of the fresh-cut product was daily evaluated by visual determination of color, shape (indication of crispness) and discoloration (browning); together these attributes were translated into an Overall Visual Quality (OVQ) value. In addition, <b>off-odour</b> and sourness production were scored immediately after opening of the bags. Samples of the fresh-cut product were taken to determine the total microbial load and to investigate the bacterial species composition using mass sequencing analysis. The decrease of OVQ over time showed a down sigmoid curve, reaching the limit of consumer acceptance after about eight days. Total bacterial counts increased from about 5 log at day 1 to about 8 log colony forming units (CFU) per gram at day 7. Initially, Pseudomonas species were dominant but when the package became anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in particular Leuconostoc spp. and Lactococcus spp. became more abundant and dominated the bacterial population. Especially {{the rapid growth of}} Leuconostoc species correlated with development of a sour <b>off-odour,</b> represented by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids in the product and the decrease in OVQ. Results indicate that metabolites produced by LAB are responsible for <b>off-odour</b> production and loss of sensorial quality. Based on this knowledge, new strategies for shelf-life improvement may be designed to prevent the dominance of LAB in fresh cut lettuce or make shelf-life better predictable based on initial counts of LAB, that may assist the industry and retail to reduce food waste. <br/...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate migrational and sensorial changes of plastics packaging materials caused by gamma-irradiation with different irradiation doses. Various packaging plastics (two LDPE types, two PP types, PET, PA, PVC and two bag-in-box systems) were treated with irradiation doses between 7 kGy and 56 kGy in a commercial irradiation plant. Subsequently, migration into different food simulants and alternations in the sensory properties were investigated as well as the amount of volatile substances by headspace gas chromatography. As a result, the overall migration into food simulants and the extraction with iso-octane and ethanol, respectively, did not show significant changes effected by irradiation treatment up to doses of 56 kGy.

Heat-shock treatment, however, may also affect the vitality of the plant tissue, leading to early senescence symptoms. In the present study several heat-shock treatments were tested for their effect on pink discoloration and on lettuce tissue vitality. The optimal heat-shock treatment was found within a narrow range of temperatures (between 45 and 47. 5 °C) and application times (between 30 and 180 s). Heat-shock treatment reduced significantly the PAL activity by a factor 3 during the first 5 d of storage but increased the respiration rate of the produce by a factor 2 on day 5. We recommend to optimize the packaging to suit the heat-shock associated higher respiration rate of the treated product in order to increase the shelf life of the fresh-cut lettuce...|$|R
