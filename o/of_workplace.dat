Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side <b>of</b> <b>workplace</b> safety.|$|E

This is quite satisfactory according to existing theory. However, of these explanatory factors only the number <b>of</b> <b>workplaces</b> influences the net in-commuting. But by using spatial lag structures it is shown that unemployment in neighbourhood municipalities influences net in-commuting. Finally, evidence of impact of local spatial industrial {{patterns on the}} commuting behaviour is provided, and the nature and reasons for these spatial patterns are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is the {{theoretical}} and applied substantiation <b>of</b> competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>workplaces</b> as a defining feature and component for provision of decent work. The author’s interpretation of the concept “competitiveness of workplaces” and signs of its manifestation in different aspects of social and labor relations are given. Suggestions for improving the methodological structure of the certification <b>of</b> <b>workplaces</b> {{in the context of}} determining the components of their competitiveness are outlined. The necessity of implementing a number of measures to create new high-tech workplaces and modernize the existing ones with the aim of bringing their level to the competitive one is justified. The results of analyzing individual indicators <b>of</b> competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>workplaces</b> in the economy of Ukraine for 2006 - 2015 are presented. It is proved that under conditions of the entry of Ukraine into the European space, the dominant factor in increasing the competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>workplaces</b> is the modernization of the existing ones and bringing them to the level of high-tech and high-performance ones. It is noted that the theoretical and methodological basis for assessing the level <b>of</b> competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>workplaces</b> and determining the directions for its improvement is formed by the concept of decent work and the indicators of decent work deficit that are singled out on its basis...|$|R
