50|$|Engineer's blue, Prussian blue in an <b>oily</b> <b>base,</b> is the {{traditional}} material used for spotting metal surfaces such as surface plates and bearings for hand scraping. A thin layer of nondrying paste is applied to a reference surface and transfers to the high spots of the workpiece. The toolmaker then scrapes, stones, or otherwise removes the marked high spots. Prussian blue is preferable because it will not abrade the extremely precise reference surfaces as many ground pigments may.|$|E
50|$|Atropa {{belladonna}} {{and related}} plants, such as Datura stramonium (commonly known as jimson weed or jimsonweed), have occasionally {{been used as}} recreational drugs because of the vivid hallucinations and delirium they produce. However, these hallucinations are most commonly described as very unpleasant, and recreational use is considered extremely dangerous {{because of the high}} risk of unintentional fatal overdose. In addition, the central nervous system effects of atropine include memory disruption, which may lead to severe confusion. The major effects of belladonna consumption last for three to four hours, visual hallucinations can last for three to four days, and some negative aftereffects are preserved for several days. The use of belladonna as a recreational drug is reported to bring about predominantly bad trips that the users want never to repeat {{for as long as they}} live. Trips induced by belladonna are threatening, dark, demonic, hellish, frightening, and terrifying. Occasionally, belladonna can induce out-of-body experiences, a heightened sense of awareness, and enhance sexual, mystical and lucid dreaming experiences often in combination with other psychoactive plants. Positive experiences induced by belladonna consumption are rare.Historically, the plant was an important, active ingredient in witches' flying ointments : complex, transdermally-absorbed hallucinogens with a fatty or <b>oily</b> <b>base,</b> which caused a deathlike trance in which vivid hallucinations of flight and bacchanalian carousal were experiencedbelow.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMost steroidal ointments contain {{propylene}} glycol (PG) and surfactants, which improve the solubility of corticosteroids in white petrolatum. Surfactants aid the uniform dispersal of PG within white petrolatum. Since the surfactants used in generic ointments are usually {{different from those}} used in brand name ointments, we investigated the effects of surfactants on the rheological properties of three brand name ointments and six equivalent generic ointments. We detected marked differences in hardness, adhesiveness, and spreadability among the ointments. Further examinations of model ointments consisting of white petrolatum, PG, and surfactants revealed that the abovementioned properties, especially hardness and adhesiveness, were markedly affected by the surfactants. Since steroidal ointments are often admixed with moisturizing creams prior to use, we investigated the mixing compatibility of the ointments with heparinoid cream and how this was affected by their surfactants. We found that the ointments containing glyceryl monostearate demonstrated good mixing compatibility, whereas those containing non-ionic surfactants with polyoxyethylene chains exhibited phase separation. These results were also {{consistent with the findings}} for the model ointments, which indicates that the mixing compatibility of steroidal ointments with heparinoid cream is determined by the emulsifying capacity of the surfactants in their <b>oily</b> <b>bases...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectrorheological (ER) fluids, {{discovered}} in 1947 by W. WINSLOW, are concentrated suspensions of solid particles in an <b>oily</b> <b>base</b> liquid.

In order to study the disposal testing characteristics of highly emulsified <b>oily</b> wastewater <b>based</b> on hydrophilic dialysis membranes,No. 1000 cylinder oil and emulsifier is used to make highly emulsified oily wastewater,and a small oil/waster separating tester is created. The relationships between the temperature,consistency of original highly emulsified oily wastewater and dialysis membrane aperture are tested. Not only is the pollution resistance of the dialysis membrane tested on the basis of resolution MEPC. 107 (49),but the attenuation characteristic of the dialysis membrane is also tested after self-cleaning each time. All the tests show that for dialysis membranes with in the range 0. 1 μm to 0. 45 μm,the treatment capability will increase with the aperture;they all show a similar flow vs temperature curve,with the treatment capability first increasing and then decreasing with the increasing temperature;when the aperture of the dialysis membrane reaches 0. 45 μm,the separation of highly emulsified oily wastewater is best achieved at 55 - 60 ℃.

To improve the bioavailability of CoQ(10), we have proposed {{to formulate a}} nanoemulsion consisting of salmon oil, salmon lecithin, CoQ(10) and water. A commercial <b>oily</b> mixture, <b>based</b> on soybean oil and CoQ(10), was used for comparison, {{as well as a}} second oily mixture, composed of salmon lecithin, salmon oil and CoQ(10). Salmon oil and salmon lecithin were used as sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The maximum solubility of CoQ(10) in salmon oil was 81. 30 ± 0. 08 mg/mL at 37 °C. Mean droplets size of the control and CoQ(10) nanoemulsions was 164 and 167 nm, respectively. The nanoemulsion was stable during 30 days at 25 °C. Bioavailability was evaluated as the area under the curve of CoQ(10) plasma concentration in male Wistar rats following oral administration of the three formulations of CoQ(10). The nanoemulsion increases at twice the bioavailability of CoQ(10) than conventional oily formulations regardless the nature of used fatty acids (soybean and salmon oils). Prepared nanoemulsion represents a vectorization of both LC-PUFAs and CoQ(10). That could be an interesting way to increase the absorption of these two bioactive molecules with natural low availability...|$|R

This wastewater is a mixture of fresh water and seawater containing various contaminants. Typical contaminants may include fuels, oils, greases, detergents, solvents, rusts, paints, insulation material and a wide variety of other substances. Bilge water is a very challenging wastewater to treat due to large variations in production rates and the complex nature of the wastes in solution. Membrane <b>based</b> <b>Oily</b> Water Separators (OWS) are being increasingly used throughout the world for the treatment of oily wastewater.

40|$|The chronic {{discharge}} of oily wastewater, mainly including bilge water, offshore produced water and ballast water, has {{been referred to}} as a major contributor to marine oil pollution. Although gravity-based treatment techniques have been widely used to separate oil from wastewater, many dissolved toxic organics, particularly Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{are not likely to be}} effectively removed and may cause severe environmental problems. Further treatment has therefore become necessary for the shipping and offshore oil and gas industries, particularly in the harsh environments (e. g., the Arctic Ocean) where ecosystems are extremely vulnerable. Among many chemical and biological treatment techniques, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and advanced oxidation techniques have been recently regarded as promising solutions to the removal of PAHs. Such advanced treatment systems, as compared to the traditional ones, are usually lack of in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms and kinetics, process control requirements, and long-term planning strategies. More particularly, the integration of process control and operation planning has been proven in the literature to greatly reduce process cost and improve system performance. However, such integration is usually complicated by many factors such as the multi-scale nature of decisions, the lack of knowledge of process dynamics and control, and uncertainty. These deficiencies can drastically hinder the widespread application of these advanced treatment systems in the shipping and offshore industries. In response to these knowledge and technique gaps, this research proposes an integrated process control and operation planning system to aid marine <b>oily</b> wastewater management <b>based</b> on experimental study, process modeling, process control, operation planning and their coupling...|$|R
