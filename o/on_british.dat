5|$|Although L'Hermite {{achieved}} minor successes against individual British shipping, his {{force was}} too small to have a serious impact <b>on</b> <b>British</b> trade in the region and the promised reinforcements failed to materialise {{in the aftermath of the}} destruction of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, ten days before L'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient. In early January 1806, L'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig but was still unable to make any significant impact <b>on</b> <b>British</b> trade operations. In the spring of 1806 L'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic, taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil. During the return journey to France in August 1806, the squadron was caught in a major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged, limping to a port in the United States for repairs. The rest of the squadron continued on to France, L'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus. The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers.

The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut {{concrete}} finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence <b>on</b> <b>British</b> architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|E
