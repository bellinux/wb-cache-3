In particular, the joint distribution of mortality and investment returns {{is crucial in}} determining capital requirements {{as well as in}} pricing and hedging of mortality-linked securities and <b>other</b> <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products. This paper proposes simple stochastic models that are well suited for numerical analysis of mortality-linked cash flows. The models are calibrated with a data set covering six countries and 56 years. Statistical analysis supports the known dependence of old-age mortality on GDP which, in turn, is connected to many sectors of financial markets. Our models allow for a simple quantitative description of such connections. Particular attention is paid to the long-term development of mortality rates, which is an important issue in life insurance...|$|E

Life insurance is applying to all insurances in which death in one or more persons brings a payment of agreed amount of money by the insurance company. Life insurance includes all types of insurances which cover from risks for life or health of a person: life insurance, rent insurance, tontine insurance, additional insurance with life insurance, insurance from accidents, voluntarily pension insurance, voluntarily-private health insurance etc. Life insurance has a central spot in insurance market. It is a specific form of insurance which successfully combines insurance and saving.

40|$|This thesis {{gives some}} {{perspectives}} on insurance mathematics related to <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> and / or reinsurance. Catastrophes and large accidents resulting in many lost lives are unfortunatley known to happen {{over and over}} again. A new model for the occurence of catastrophes is presented; it models the number of catastrophes, how many lives that are lost, how many lost lives that are insured by a specific insurer {{and the cost of}} the resulting claims, this  makes it possible to calculate the price of reinsurance contracts linked to catastrophic events.   Ruin is the result if claims exceed inital capital and the premiums collected by an insurance company. We analyze the Cramér-Lundberg approximation for the ruin probability and give an explicit rate of convergence in the case were claims are bounded by some upper limit. Death is known to be the only thing that is certain in life. Individual life spans are however random, models for and statistics of mortality are imortant for, amongst <b>others,</b> <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies whose payments ultimatley depend on people being alive or dead. We analyse the stochasticity of mortality and perform a variance decomposition were the variation in mortality data is either explained by the covariates age and time, unexplained systematic variation or random noise due to a finite population. We suggest a mixed regression model for mortality and fit it to data from the US and Sweden, including prediction intervals of future mortalities.

40|$|A <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policy {{provides}} a cash payment {{when a person}} dies. This payment {{is known as the}} death benefit. Many people buy <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> to protect the people who are dependent on them. <b>Others</b> buy <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> as a way to leave a cash gift to their spouse, children, grandchildren, and charities at their death. If you have made the decision to buy a policy, you may wonder which type of policy to choose since there are several different types of policies. The policy is written on the life of a person, known as the insured. The owner makes payments, known as premiums, to the insurance company for the policy. In return, the insurance company agrees to pay the death benefit to the beneficiary if the insured dies within the stated term. Term Term insurance is the most basic type of <b>life</b> <b>insurance.</b> The policy is written for the term of the policy, usually from one to 30 years. If the insured dies within the stated term, the insurance company pays the death benefit to the beneficiary. When the term ends, the insurance ends. The premiums for term insurance are usually the lowest among the different types of <b>life</b> <b>insurance,</b> but will increase with the age of the insured. There is no cash value in a term life policy. (Cash value will be discussed in greater detail later.) This means there is no money for loans or to pay for the insurance if you can’t pay the premiums. Many employers offer a type of term insurance known as “group ” term to their workers. Group policies cost less, and many companies pay the premiums. Generally, the policy is only good {{for as long as the}} worker stays with the company. Term insurance is suggested for those who only need the death benefit for a certain period of time.

40|$|The study {{proposed}} the variable <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policy {{as an alternative}} method of formulating thewhole life policy to effectively hedge against inflation. The discussion ended with {{a report of the}} consequences of increased government regulation in the whole <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. Conclusions Based on the study, the following conclusions should be considered: 1) The whole <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policy, because it involves a fixed dollar benefit accruing {{over a long period of}} time, is greatly affected by inflationary forces. Consideration should be given to ascertaining either methods of manipulating the present whole life policy to meet the inflation risk or to develop an alternative policy formulation which would effectively hedge against inflation. 2) The whole life policy is characterized by its complexity and flexibility. While the complexity exposes it to the adverse effects of inflation more readily and substantially than <b>other</b> types of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage, the flexibility enables it to be manipulated by the policyholder in several ways to provide an adequate response to the risk of inflation. A policyholder should take advantage of his policy loan option by investing the borrowed cash reserve in more financially profitable instruments. He should purchase his coverage from a mutual <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> company in order that the profits earned by the company will be returned to him and not to a profit-seeking stockholder. Also, a policyholder should consider a variable annuity to enable a financially sufficient retirement as well as providing that the proceeds of the policy be handled by a lump sum option to in turn be handled by a banking official.
