KAStrion goals were to maximize the production time of wind turbine farms by delivering a complete solution build upon a stand-alone analysis system which delivers a continuous on-site pre-diagnostic of the machine based on a multi-modal spectral monitoring technology. This embedded system located in the nacelle is connected to a tailored diagnostic center which delivers a periodic reporting on technical state of each machine of the farm. The strong innovation of KAStrion was to develop firstly a data-driven signal processing, referred to as AStrion, to automatically analyze, detect, classify all the spectral structures (harmonics and sidebands) of vibration signals, and secondly an original approach, referred to as SMESA, to process polyphase electrical signals.

40|$|International audienceIndustrial {{plants are}} facing today with new {{challenges}} to well optimize {{performance of their}} operation and maintenance. For example, the sustainability paradigm is introducing new requirements {{to be taken into}} account in the decision-making process. In that way, energy consumption (EC) and energy efficiency (EE) are two critical performances impacting severely the plant effectiveness mainly with regards to its life cycle cost. Although there are models for following these two performances at the component level, there is a real need for modelling them at the function or system levels not only to support strategic decisions (and not only operational one) but also to forecast them to make decisions in advance for better optimization. Thus, the principles of a generic approach, which is focused on EE performance (EEP) and built on the modelling of this EEP at functional level, and its prognostics to calculate a Remaining Energy-Efficient Lifetime (REEL), are proposed in this paper. The REEL should integrate future mission profiles and operation conditions. The prognostics model is developed from a data-driven approach by using a nonlinear regression method. This generic approach is instantiated and validated on the TELMA platform (a motor-driven system) which is simulating a real industrial plant addressing unwinding metal bobbins. So, models are built from field data of two independent motors (the component level and electrical energy) in addition to data on the function supported by means of these two motors. It leads to prognostics models usable to predict the EE evolution - REEL (the input of the decision-making module) both at the component level from the relationships between speed performance (motor <b>output),</b> <b>bearing</b> deterioration (Gamma process) and EE, and at the functional level from the relationships between productivity performance (functional output on the product delivered), components deterioration level and EE...|$|E

40|$|The {{crosshead}} bearing in large two-stroke diesel engines operates under severe lubrication conditions because hydrodynamic action {{is limited by}} low-amplitude, low-velocity oscillation under high specific load. The recent trend toward more compact engines with increased <b>output</b> raises the <b>bearing</b> specific load, thereby significantly increasing the lubrication severity. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} find a means to prevent tribological failure such as seizure. In this study, a technique for monitoring abnormal vibration was evaluated using a dynamically loaded bearing seizure test rig that is capable of simulating load patterns and relative oscillations of the {{crosshead bearing}} in actual engines. Vibration spikes occur around crank angles of ± 90 deg where the oscillating speed is zero during one cycle. When lubrication is impaired, an abnormal vibration spike caused by severe metal-to-metal contact is generated at a crank angle of approximately + 90 deg, where the oil film thickness is a minimum. The frequency of this spike generation increases with the degree of impairment. If running-in is carried out immediately after detecting abnormal vibration, the bearing surface is conformed, thereby avoiding severe metal-to-metal contact damage. The detection of abnormal vibration can be an effective means to prevent seizure of the crosshead bearing...|$|R

To achieve this, some theory behind the MUSIC direction finding algorithm, describing its Direction of Arrival (DOA) metric, is first presented. MATLAB simulations are conducted and statistics are collected on the DOA metrics. The magnitudes of these metrics {{are directly related to}} the quality of the bearings produced by the MUSIC algorithm. This research provides HF RADAR users with a practical quality metric for the radial current velocities and their associated bearings produced by the HF RADAR system. Eliminating data with low DOA metrics can decrease the RMS error (by an average of 2. 33 cm/s) in up to 70 % of the spatial RADAR grid, however comes at a cost of an increase the RMS error(by an average 1. 08 cm/s) in 20 % of the same grid.

However, translation of evidence based medicine to practice is impeded by efficiency {{measures such as}} cost per case-mix adjusted separation in hospitals, which ignore health effects of care. In this paper we identify a correspondence method that allows quality variables under control of providers to be incorporated in efficiency measures consistent with maximising net benefit. Including effects framed from a disutility bearing (utility reducing) perspective (e. g. mortality, morbidity or reduction in life years) as inputs and minimising quality inclusive costs on the cost-disutility plane is shown to enable efficiency measures consistent with maximising net benefit under a one to one correspondence. The method combines advantages of radial properties with an appropriate objective of maximising net benefit to overcome problems of inappropriate objectives implicit with alternative methods, whether specifying quality variables with utility <b>bearing</b> <b>output</b> (e. g. survival, reduction in morbidity or life years), hyperbolic or exogenous variables. This correspondence approach is illustrated in undertaking efficiency comparison at a clinical activity level for 45 Australian hospitals allowing for their costs and mortality rates per admission.

Comparison on the cost-disutility plane has previously {{been shown to have}} distinct advantages in comparing multiple strategies in HTA, which this paper naturally extends to a robust method and framework for comparing efficiency of health care providers in practice.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Complexes perform {{numerous}} {{hazardous material}} handling operations {{within the confines}} of a glovebox. The DOE is continuing to seek more efficient and safer means of handling these materials inside gloveboxes rather than the conventional, labor-intensive method through lead lined gloves. The use of glovebox automation technology will also be critical to the DOE in its efforts to comply with its mandated ALARA principles in handling the hazardous materials associated with the cleanup process. Operations associated with materials processing in a glovebox are similar to many industrial tasks, but the unique glovebox environment and Plutonium material properties create a unique set of challenges for conventional automation machinery. Such properties include: Low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation, high abrasiveness, corrosiveness, pyrophoric tendencies, rapid dispersal and permeation of environment, diffuses quickly, and possible incompatible material interaction. The glovebox presents the following challenges: existing gloveboxes may not be readily altered or even modified at all, complex mechanical operations for maintenance and repair are difficult or impossible through gloves, failed equipment may not be removed easily or at all. If a broken piece of equipment cannot be bagged-out through a glove port (approximately 216 mm (8 1 / 2 inch) diameter) it must remain in place. Broken equipment obstructs further operations. If it renders the entire glovebox unusable, a significant volume of waste is generated and an expensive system must be disposed of and replaced. A moderate sized glovebox alone costs between $ 250, 000 and $ 500, 000 and an equipment malfunction, which penetrates the glovebox and exposes the room to Plutonium or other toxic materials, is catastrophic. In addition to the human exposure issues, cleanup can easily run into the millions of dollars. A solution to the issues described above is ARM Automation Inc. 's (ARM) modular robotic manipulator technology developed for DOE EM operations, which addresses many of the issues discussed in the previous section. This manipulator system has the capability of custom configurations, which accommodate common glovebox tasks such as materials repackaging. The modular nature and quick connects of this system simplify installations into ''hot'' boxes and any potential modifications or repair therein. In the field of automation and robotics, a very common element is one used to generate motion for precise positioning of loads. One example of such an automation component would be an individual joint within an industrial robotic manipulator. This component consists of a tightly integrated package containing an electric motor, gear train, <b>output</b> support <b>bearings,</b> position sensors, brake, servo-amplifier and communications controller. Within the context of this paper, this key building block is referred to as an actuator module.

Thereby, a modular approach to automation which utilizes a small set of versatile actuator modules can be used to construct a broad range of robotic systems and automation cells suited to EM applications. By providing a pre-engineered, pre-integrated motion system to different robotics users within the DOE, new automation systems can be more quickly created without extensive expertise in motion control or the expense of building custom equipment...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{expression}} of the Endo 16 gene of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is controlled by interactions with at least 13 different DNA-binding factors. These interactions occur within a cis-regulatory domain that extends about 2300 bp upstream from the transcription start site. A recent functional characterization of this domain reveals six different subregions, or cis-regulatory modules, each of which displays a specific regulatory subfunction when linked with the basal promoter {{and in some cases}} various other modules (C. -H. Yuh and E. Davidson (1996) Development 122, 1069 - 1082). In the present work, we analyzed quantitative time-course measurements of the CAT enzyme <b>output</b> of embryos <b>bearing</b> expression constructs controlled by various Endo 16 regulatory modules, either singly or in combination. Three of these modules function positively in that, in isolation, each is capable of promoting expression in vegetal plate and adjacent cell lineages, though with different temporal profiles of activity. Models for the mode of interaction of the three positive modules with one another were tested by assuming mathematical relations that would generate, from the measured single module time courses, the experimentally observed profiles of activity obtained when the relevant modules are physically linked in the same construct. The generated and observed time functions were compared, and the differences were minimized by least squares adjustment of a scale parameter. When the modules were tested in context of the endogenous promoter region, one of the positive modules (A) was found to increase the output of the others (B and G), by a constant factor. In contrast, a solution in which the time-course data of modules A and B are multiplied by one another was required for the interrelations of the positive modules when a minimal SV 40 promoter was used. One interpretation is that, in this construct, each module independently stimulates the basal transcription complex. We used a similar approach to analyze the repressive activity of the three Endo 16 cis-regulatory modules that act negatively in controlling spatial expression. The evidence obtained confirms that the repressive modules act only by affecting the output of module A (C. -H. Yuh and E. Davidson (1996) Development 122, 1069 - 1082). A new hierarchical model of the cis-regulatory system was formulated in which module A plays a central integrating role, and which also implies specific functions for certain DNA-binding sites within the basal promoter fragment of the gene. Additional kinetic experiments were then carried out, and key aspects of the model were confirmed...|$|R

An extensive parametric study has been carried out and the results of the analyses are presented as normalized means and coefficients of variation of bearing capacity factor, and comparisons between different cases are presented. The results indicate that, in general, the mean of the bearing capacity reduces as soil variability increases and the worst case scenario occurs when the correlation length is in the range of 0. 5 to 1. 0 times the footing width. The problem of estimating the bearing capacity of shallow strip footings founded on multi-layered soil profiles is very complex, due to the incomplete knowledge of interactions and relationships between parameters. Much research has been carried out on single- and two-layered homogeneous soil profiles. At present, the inaccurate weighted average method is the only technique available for estimating the bearing capacity of footing on soils with three or more layers. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to develop meta-models for bearing capacity estimation. ANNs are numerical modelling techniques that imitate the human brain capability to learn from experience. This research is limited to shallow strip footing founded on soil mass consisting of ten layers, which are weightless, purely cohesive and cohesive-frictional. A large number of data has been obtained by using finite element limit analysis. These data are used to train and verify the ANN models. The shear strength (cohesion and friction angle), soil thickness, and footing width are used as model inputs, as they are influencing factors of bearing capacity of footings. The model <b>outputs</b> are the <b>bearing</b> capacities of the footings. The developed ANN-based models are then compared with the weighted average method. Hand-calculation design formulae for estimation of bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered soil profiles, based on the ANN models, are presented. It is shown that the ANN-based models have the ability to predict the bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered soil profiles {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, and outperform traditional methods.
