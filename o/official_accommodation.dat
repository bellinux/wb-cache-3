In April and May of that year, he was encountering {{problems}} with his wife, and he accompanied Montagu's fleet to the Netherlands to bring Charles II back from exile. Montagu was made Earl of Sandwich on 18 June, and Pepys secured the position of Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board on 13 July.

50|$|Traditional reunion and Commencement {{events are}} linked, and {{celebrate}} the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At {{the conclusion of}} final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for <b>official</b> <b>accommodations</b> in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.|$|R

50|$|Pennington was {{the site}} of a migrant hostel from 1950 until it closed in 1985. It was known as Finsbury Hostel from 1949 to 1966, then renamed to Pennington. It {{initially}} consisted of Nissen huts, Romney huts and Quonset huts, mostly second hand Army surplus. The huts provided dormitory and family accommodation, with separate dining, recreation and latrine buildings. Despite <b>official</b> closure, <b>accommodation</b> continued for migrants up to the mid-1990s.|$|R

50|$|Gălăciuc (pronounced Gah-lah-chook) is a youth camp in Vrancea county, Romania, 3 km {{west from}} Tulnici village, 10 km east of Lepşa resort and 75 km west of Focşani at an {{altitude}} of 710 meters, near National Road 2D, {{in some of the most}} beautiful and picturesque surroundings in the Carpathians. Built in the 1970s in a very remote, mountainous region, it is the host of some national or international contests such as the Infoeducatie Applied Informatics Contests or The Omega Balkanic Physics contest. The camp can accommodate 390 persons, but the very poor conditions available on site have restricted its <b>official</b> maximum <b>accommodation</b> number to 250.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{southwest}} {{side of the}} agora in Athens, {{and part of the}} Bouleuterion complex stood the Tholos, a round temple (tholos is the Greek word for [...] "dome or cupola," [...] when used in an architectural sense), eighteen metres in diameter, which served as seat of the Prytaneis of Athens and so was their Prytaneion. It was this round feature that allowed archaeologists to identify the badly damaged buildings surrounding it. It functioned as a kind of all purpose venue, with both a dining hall and sleeping quarters for some of the <b>officials.</b> This <b>accommodation</b> was necessary as, after the reforms under Cleisthenes, one third of the senate had to be present in the complex at all times. It was built around 470 BCE by Cimon, to serve as a dining hall for the boule (members of the senate).|$|R

Parties to {{the convention}} also agree to criminalise the attempted commission or threatened commission of such acts. [...] "Internationally protected persons" [...] is a term created by the convention, and refers explicitly to heads of state, heads of government, foreign ministers, ambassadors, other official diplomats, and members of their families.|$|R
50|$|Akasaka Palace (Akasaka rikyu), or the State Guest House (Geihinkan), {{is one of}} the two State Guesthouses of the Government of Japan. The palace was {{originally}} built as the Imperial Palace for the Crown Prince (Togu gosho) in 1909.Today the palace is designated by the government of Japan as an <b>official</b> <b>accommodation</b> for visiting state dignitaries. Located in the Moto Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo, the building took on its present function in 1974, having previously been an imperial detached palace.

30|$|The {{preference}} for independent and hassle- free accommodation away from official commitments creates {{a demand for}} rented housing. Non-availability of <b>official</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{in the private sector}} may also influence the decision to rent houses (Al-Jassem 2013). The continually increasing demand for real estate, the lag in supply, and increasing prices are hurdles for potential buyers.|$|E
5000|$|Parties to the {{convention}} agree to criminalise the commission of murders or kidnappings of UN or association personnel as well as violent attacks against the equipment, <b>official</b> premises, private <b>accommodation,</b> or means of transport of such persons. Parties to {{the convention}} also agree to criminalise the attempted commission or threatened commission of such acts. [...] "UN personnel" [...] refers to individuals engaged or deployed by the UN Secretary-General {{as members of the}} military, police, or civilian components of a UN operation; it also includes officials of the UN specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency. [...] "Associated personnel" [...] includes other personnel—such as members of non-governmental organizations—assigned to act in an official capacity by UN personnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is built}} on an oyster and mussel bed. This lighthouse is unique in that the base is shaped like the prow of a ship to reduce {{the impact of the}} waves on the structure. The lighthouse {{is open to the public}} although no <b>official</b> tours or <b>accommodations</b> are made. However, visitors to the area frequently access the beacon by kayak, often taking a commercial tour. The National Park Service cut a trail to the lighthouse through the brush in 2005 to allow visitors a closer vantage point. The trail begins on the northeast side of the fort and is about 0.8 mile (1.3 km) long. At low tide, hikers can get within approximately 200 yards (180 m) of the lighthouse.|$|R
40|$|Universities and {{academic}} couples frequently face {{the dilemma of}} finding two jobs at the same institution for two job candidates who form an academic couple. Universities are increasingly adopting <b>official</b> partner <b>accommodation</b> policies {{to address this issue}} during the hiring process. Little is known about the effect these policies have on recruitment, retention, and productivity. We seek to understand how specific types of policies – such as the one in place at Washington State University – affect the university’s ability to recruit and retain highly productive candidates. We develop a theoretical model that predicts that when couples have a strong desire to work near each other, and universities evaluate members of couples independently one of another, couple hires will comprise some of an institutions highest quality faculty. We test our prediction using employment data from WSU. Using salary and promotion as indirect measures of productivity, we find that new assistant professors hired under the accommodation policy are 30 % more likely than their peers to gain tenure. We also find that individual’s hired via accommodation have 4. 6 % higher salaries than their peers on average. Thus, partner accommodation policies may be instrumental in the recruitment of top academic candidates...|$|R
50|$|In 1958 a new larger modern Court House was {{constructed}} in Quay Street, adjacent to the 1900 Police Station building and facing Anzac Park situated {{on the banks of}} the Burnett River. At this time the original court house was remodelled to accommodate the Police Service. The major alteration to the building was the reorganisation of the court room space to provide four new offices and the addition of a recreation room and other amenities at the rear of the building. Various out buildings including wash houses, toilets, motor garages, horse stables and bicycle sheds were also located on the site at this time. The aggregate police site included the 1882-4 Court House, and the 1900 Police Station, lock up keepers residence, the cell block, providing a range of <b>official</b> and residential <b>accommodation</b> for the police service.|$|R
40|$|The Justice and Development Party (JDP, Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi) has {{launched}} a rapprochement policy toward the Alevis. The JDP's Alevi Opening has presented a unique case in Turkey's latest identity politics not only because Alevi claims, for the first time, came {{to be involved in}} political processes for <b>official</b> recognition and <b>accommodation,</b> but also because the process was handled by a political party which is regarded to have retained Islamist roots in Sunni interpretation. This article explores the JDP's Alevi Opening process and tries to explain the motivations behind the party's decision to incorporate the Alevi question in its political agenda. What is more, the debate that the opening has caused is also under scrutiny with the positions and arguments held by the actors and the agencies involved in the process, e. g., the Alevis (the secularist and the conservative wings), the General Directorate of Religious Affairs, the National Security Council, the JDP leadership and the Islamist intellectuals...|$|R
