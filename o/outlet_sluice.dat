40|$|The Dutch {{department}} of Public Works {{had a problem}} regarding wave impacts on a beam in the Stevin <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices,</b> located in the Afsluitdijk. Wave impacts on this beam could also cause a peak pressure on the barrier gate, just behind the beam. The numerical program ComFLOW and physical scale experiments were used to predict the wave impacts for different hydraulic conditions (i. e. wave height, wave period and water level). The research questions were: 1. How is the wave load on the northern gates depending {{on the presence of}} the military beam? 2. How large is a wave impact load {{on the bottom of the}} military beam in the Stevin <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices?</b> 3. How well can the numerical model ComFLOW and physical modelling be used to determine the wave impact on the bottom of the military beam in the Stevin <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices?</b> 2 D scaled experiments were performed making use of a model with the (simplified) geometry of the Stevin <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices</b> and regular waves. It was found that the largest wave impacts occurred for water levels equal to the bottom plane of the beam or slightly under it. This happened for the shortest waves in the test domain. The largest pressure measured on the beam was approximately 50 kPa or 35 H, with H representing the incident wave height in front of the model. It was also found that the spread in the peak pressures for one single experiment was large. The results of the measured impulse per peak showed far less spread. The effect of wave impacts under the beam was also found on the vertical wall under the beam. The actual pressures however were less and they were decreasing with increasing depth. Besides physical wave impact testing, a few experiments were performed with the beam removed from the model. This resulted in wave simply running up the vertical wall of the model. They did not cause a wave impact. The measurements of both type of experiments, with and without a beam, were compared. This revealed that the total wave impulse on the gate was not affected by the presence of the beam. However the distribution of the pressure within a single wave period was significantly different. In case of a beam, a large impact peak was observed, whereas the other wave only showed a small hump caused by the deflected flow against the vertical wall. When the calculated and measured wave impact results were compared it became clear that ComFLOW underestimated the peak pressures by a factor 2 to 20 for the pressures on the impact plane. The same was done for the peak impulse. This showed that the impulse of the peak on the impact plane were underestimated by a factor 2 at most. These results confirmed that the used grid was too coarse for the program to model the physics correctly. The main conclusions to the research questions were: 1. The presence of the military beam causes a different distribution of the force on the gate within a wave period. The total amount of impulse is more or less the same as for the situation without a beam. With the military beam, a wave impact results in a peak force on the gate. Without the beam, there will be no peak force. 2. The largest measured wave impact pressure is 35 H. 3. Both ComFLOW and physical modelling can be used to predict wave impacts for the geometry of Stevin <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices.</b> Much care should be taken when modelling and much attention should go to the input parameters of the program.

40|$|This report {{concerning}} {{the development of}} a new water management system in direct tidal swamps with acid sulphate soils with the Pulau Petal area in South Kalimantan as an example. The most important characteristic of acid sulphate soils is that the soil contains the mineral pyrite that oxidizes when the soil is aerated and produces sulphuric acid. To prevent the soil from acidification it must be kept waterlogged and if this fails or acid or toxic elements are already present they must be leached out, which requires large amounts of water. The state of the art of lowland development in Indonesia and the formation, ripening and classification of acid sulphate soils are discussed briefly. In relation to this alternative reclamation strategies are laid out. The Pulau Petak area is an island formed by the rivers Barito, Pulau Petak and Kapuas and the Java sea and is a lowland area with acid sulphate soils. Existing research programs in this area are used to picture the general situation. Data on tidal movements in the area are scarce and had to be calculated. Transmissivities are extremely high varying from 90 to 600 m^/day. After these general chapters the study focuses on the particular boundary conditions of the area with direct tidal influence i. e. gravity irrigation is possible at least during springtide and drainage is always possible. This lead to the objective to design a new water management system that provides the irrigation and drainage facilities for one local rice variety per year with the restrictions that drainage water must not be reused for irrigation as it can be acid and interflow of acid ground water must be intercepted. The new water management system will have a completely separated irrigation and drainage system where a one-way-flow is induced by installing an inlet sluice at the entrance of the secondary irrigation canal that closes when the flow direction reverses and an <b>outlet</b> <b>sluice</b> which allows only water to flow out is installed in the secondary drainage canal. The water level in the irrigation canal will be kept as high as possible and the water level in the drainage canal will be as low as possible. The strategy on tertiary level during the cropping (wet) season is to supply water for the plant and if possible to leach the soil. If a shortage of irrigation water to fulfil the needs for both these practices occurs the water level in the tertiary drain is set up to reduce the leaching component. In the dry season the water level in the tertiary drain is set in order to keep the soil water logged and irrigation is only applied when the water table tends to drop below the soil surface. There is an intermediate period of a month that proceeds the cropping season where the objective is to maximize the leaching flow within the boundary condition that the soil stays water logged. From a control point of view the above can be translated in an open irrigation system to minimize the headless and upstream control water level regulators in the tertiary drain that can maintain two setpoints. For this purpose a Vlugter gate was modified in such a way that a switch can be made in the setpoint that is maintained by increasing or decreasing the counterweight. The design of this gate and the size of the counter weight that should be added to switch from the low to the high setpoint are given. Finally a feasibility study of the project was executed where the internal rate of return was used as indicator of feasibility. With a project lifetime of 40 years and a construction time of two years the internal rate of return appeared to be 15 %. The construction costs per net arable hectare have a present value of $ 1771. Conclusion is that it appears to be a feasible project and should therefor be carried out. In similar areas the system could be used to reclaim new lands. Further study into the quality of the irrigation water in the dry season is recommended in order to investigate the potential for growing two crops per year,and an analysis of the effects of the counter weight adjustments on the gate behaviour of the modified Vlugter gate is advisable.

40|$|Epizootic skin {{diseases}} in euryhaline flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Dutch Wadden Sea were first reported in 1988. Particularly high prevalences of skin ulcers (up to one-third of individual fish being affected) were {{encountered in the}} vicinity of sluices draining freshwater from IJsselmeer Lake, in contrast with much lower levels in the freshwater bodies behind the sluices and open sea areas (< 2 %). It was proposed that salinity stress, high bacterial loads, nutritional deficiencies, and obstruction to fish migration by the sluices could all be involved in disease causation. Results of follow-up surveys at these <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices</b> from 1994 to 2005 further substantiate our preliminary findings. The follow-up data also show a general reduction in disease and improved condition factor during this period, which can be explained by improved habitat conditions for the flounder, partly due to effective sluice gate management. Furthermore, statistical correlations (p< 0. 05) were demonstrated between flounder ulcer occurrence and chemical contaminant concentrations in liver (Hg, Cd, Cu, Zn) and bile (the metabolite 1 -OH pyrene as an indicator of chronic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure), and histological liver lesions generally indicative of contaminant exposure (hydropic vacuolization of biliary duct epithelial cells). The findings suggest that a combination of osmotic and contaminant-induced stress also contributed to the observed disease patterns. © 2011 SETAC...|$|R
40|$|After a major {{flooding}} {{in the north}} of Belgium (Flanders) in 1976, a masterplan – the so-called Sigmaplan – was elaborated in 1977 to mitigate storm surges in the Schelde estuary as to increase the level of safety. Due to changing physical circumstances and new insights in water management, the Sigmaplan was pro-foundly updated in 2005 – i. e. the so-called Actualised Sigmaplan. The Actualised Sigmaplan aims at sat-isfying both safety and ecological needs along the tidal part of the river Schelde and its tributaries in a sustainable way. Therefore, different restoration techniques are elaborated which combine safety with es-tuarine restoration, e. g. dike strengthening together with more space for the river, flood control areas (FCAs) with or without a controlled reduced tide (CRT), non-tidal wetlands, etc. In this paper, only flood control areas with a controlled reduced tide (abbreviated: FCA-CRTs) are considered. During storm surges, FCA-CRTs are filled via a lowered levee (referred to as “overflow dike ” in Figure 1). On average, this takes place {{once or twice a year}} depending on the level of the overflow dike. In addi-tion, a well-designed system with inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sluices</b> allows limited semi-diurnal water exchange be-tween the estuary and the FCA-CRT. The goal is to obtain inundation characteristics in the polder which are similar to natural tidal marshes along the estuary, in order to restore estuarine habitats which have dis-appeared over the past two centuries or degraded (elsewhere) in the estuary (Cox et al., 2006; Maris et al., 2007).

As a rule, it is necessary to adapt technology of the control and automatized control device to each other. The aim of this paper is description of the automatized leak-testing devices for fuel elements for light water reactors which are used at factories of concern JSC "TVEL " (Russia).

Part of the tube between two sluices is high-vacuum test chamber with own exhaust unit. Fuel elements one by one pass through the high-vacuum chamber connected with helium leak-tester. Thus all length of each fuel element tests for leakage consistently. Due to small volume of the vacuum chamber, the device has short the response time and high sensitivity. All parts of the device operate under computer control under special program.
