Mechanical solids removal devices move {{as slowly as}} practical to minimize resuspension of settled solids. Tanks are sized to give water an optimal residence time within the tank.

40|$|Spray profile {{measurements}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the underflow rate, and consequently, be related to hydrocyclone performance. The flow geometry of the spray discharge is found to arise from velocity patterns at the outlet orifice. Through a videographic example of an industrial hydrocyclone, it is shown that underflow profiles are typically parabolic, a feature which is indicative of the velocity at which the fluid exits. The inclusion of gravity in this model clearly highlights deficiencies in currently used models. Moreover, an intimate knowledge of factors affecting the profiles of the underflow of a cyclone is essential for the correct interpretation of videographic images. Subsequently, image data are used to estimate <b>outlet</b> <b>velocities,</b> which give an excellent insight into various fluid mechanical phenomena that are not appreciated by analysing basic operational variables.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} flow {{maldistribution}} across the monolith of an axisymmetric catalyst assembly fitted to a pulsating flow test rig. Approximately sinusoidal inlet pulse shapes with relatively low peak/mean ratio {{were applied to}} the assembly with different amplitudes and frequencies. The inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>velocities</b> were measured using Hot Wire Anemometry. Experimental results were compared with a previous study, which used inlet pulse shapes with relatively high peak/mean ratios. It is shown that (i) the flow is more maldistributed with increase in mass flow rate, (ii) the flow is in general more uniformly distributed with increase in pulsation frequency, and (iii) the degree of flow maldistribution is largely influenced by the different inlet velocity pulse shapes. Transient CFD simulations were also performed for the inlet pulse shapes used in both studies and simulations were compared with the experimental data. For inlet pulse shapes with low peak/mean ratio, CFD predictions matched measurements fairly well in the bulk central region of the monolith. For inlet pulse shapes with high peak/mean ratio, agreement was less satisfactory.

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we present an {{experimental}} approach to the simultaneous two-dimensional measurement of mixture fraction and flow velocity in a non-reacting jet flow. For this, planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) have been applied simultaneously. The aim of this work is to provide data for the validation of models used in large eddy simulations (LES) which require measurements both of quantities on a subgrid level and of spatially filtered quantities. Therefore, a high spatial resolution for both measurement techniques has been used. Beside the resulting experimental challenge to measure the two-dimensional flow field of a jet flow with large velocities (Ma 0. 2) in very small regions of interest with a distance between adjacent vectors of almost 100 µm, a quantitative measurement technique for the simultaneous determination of the mixture fraction is developed. The applied experimental setup consisted of a central nozzle from where air is expanded isothermally with high <b>outlet</b> <b>velocities</b> into a slowly moving co-flow. Here, a gaseous fluorescence tracer in negligible concentration {{is added to the}} central flow in order to measure the mixture fraction directly from the number-density dependent laser-induced fluorescence signal.

40|$|Supersonic {{flow through}} a {{two-dimensional}} cascade of airfoils is discussed {{from the point}} of view of one-dimensional gas dynamics. Two generalizations to compressible flow of the usual velocity vector diagrams are discussed, namely the Mach vector and the reduced velocity vector diagram. A relative mass flow parameter is found which represents the isentropic continuity equation on the two vector diagrams, so that for a set of given cascade inlet conditions all possible <b>outlet</b> <b>velocities</b> and directions appear on the diagrams. The largest possible tangential velocity component and the largest possible change in tangential momentum in a cascade are obtained as functions of the mass flow parameter. From these the largest obtainable stagnation pressure ratio and power of any arrangement of moving and stationary cascades may easily be obtained. Equations are given for the ratios of relative stagnation temperatures, mass flows and Mach numbers in two systems of reference moving with respect to each other. Methods for tracing graphically on the vector diagrams the flow through a stage are presented. The possibility of using cascades instead of shock waves for the transition from supersonic to subsonic flow in diffusers is pointed out. As an example a proposed single cascade supersonic diffuser is briefly analyzed by means of the reduced velocity vector diagram. ...|$|R
