40|$|Si {{epitaxial}} growth from solution in solid Al onto crystal Si substrates was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Growth in reentrant {{corners of the}} substrate {{was found to be}} favored over growth onto a flat surface. For this reason, the smaller-diameter <b>oxide</b> <b>cuts</b> used in integrated-circuit fabrication, in which no portion of the exposed substrate Si is far from a reentrant corner, are favored sites for growth. Si growth readily fills in such <b>oxide</b> <b>cuts</b> forming mesa structures potentially useful in device construction. The probable cause for such preferential growth was indicated in pressure experiments which show that regions in the solid Al under relatively less compression are favored locations for growth...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{lapidary}} {{work is done}} using motorized equipment. Polishing is {{done with}} resin or metal bonded emery, silicon carbide (carborundum), aluminium oxide (corundum) or diamond dust in successively decreasing particle sizes until a polish is achieved. In older systems the grinding and polishing powders were applied separately to the grinding or buffing wheel. Often, the final polish will use a different medium, such as tin oxide or cerium(IV) <b>oxide.</b> <b>Cutting</b> of harder stones is done with a diamond tipped saw. For softer materials silicon carbide, garnet (emery) or corundum {{can be used in}} place of the diamond. Diamond cutting, because of the extreme hardness of diamonds, requires the use of diamond tools. The cutting, grinding and polishing operations are usually lubricated with water, oil, or other liquids.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of MEMS devices {{is limited by}} the strength of critical features such as thin ligaments, <b>oxide</b> <b>cuts</b> joining layers, pin joints and hinges. Devices fabricated at Sandia's Microelectronic Development Laboratory have been successfully tested to investigate these features. A series of measurements were performed on samples with gage lengths of 15 to 1000 microns, using conventional and tungsten coated samples as well as samples that include the critical features of standard components in the test section. Specimens have a freely moving pin joint on one end that anchors the sample to the silicon die to allow rotation to reduce effects of bending. Each sample is loaded in uniaxial tension by pulling laterally with a flat tipped diamond in a computer-controlled Nanoindenter. Load is calculated by resolving the measured lateral and normal forces into the applied tensile force and frictional losses. The specimen cross section and gage length dimensions were verified by measuring against a standard in the SEM. Multiple tests can be programmed at one time and performed without operator assistance allowing the collection of significant populations of data...|$|R

25|$|Cutting is {{initiated}} by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) {{of the steel}} to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry red heat) using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting oxygen valve to release the oxygen from the central jet. The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron <b>oxide,</b> producing the <b>cut.</b> Initiating {{a cut in the}} middle of a workpiece is known as piercing.|$|R
40|$|Areal {{roughness}} parameters {{always need}} to be under control in the thin film solar cell industry because of their {{close relationship with the}} electrical efficiency of the cells. In this work, these parameters are evaluated for measurements carried out in a typical fabrication area for this industry. Measurements are made using a portable atomic force microscope on the CNC diamond cutting machine where an initial sample of transparent conductive <b>oxide</b> is <b>cut</b> into four pieces. The method is validated by making a comparison between the parameters obtained in this process and in the laboratory under optimal conditions. Areal roughness parameters and Fourier Spectral Analysis of the data show good compatibility and open the possibility to use this type of measurement instrument to perform in situ quality control. This procedure gives a sample for evaluation without destroying any of the transparent conductive oxide; in this way 100 % of the production can be tested, so improving the measurement time and rate of production...|$|R
40|$|The main {{problems}} caused by improper gating are entrained aluminium <b>oxide</b> films, <b>cuts</b> and washes, low casting yield and entrapped gas.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} effects of silver salts on biocompatible metals used for prostheses during the chemical reduction process {{to produce a}} silver antimicrobial layer on the metal’s surface. Samples of two biocompatible metals were obtained: Stainless Steel 316 L and ASTM F 75 Cobalt Chromium Alloy. Three different silver salts were also acquired: silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and silver chloride. Specimens of each metal were cut to size using a 4 - 1 / 2 inch aluminum <b>oxide,</b> 40 grit, <b>cut</b> off wheel for metal, attached to a Dewalt Angle Grinder. The biocompatible metal samples were then subject to either Solution 1, water with 10. 0 mg of silver salt per liter of water, or Solution 2, water with 20. 0 mg of silver salt per liter of water. Some samples were left untreated for comparison. The samples {{were removed from the}} solution after 5 days, rinsed, and examined using SEM. From these images, the corrosion of the metal, the increase in corrosion associated with the increase in silver salt concentration, as well as the differences between each of the metal and salt solution combinations was observed.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the characteristic of wear on the clearance face of newly multilayer-coated K 10 cutting tools when cutting mersawa wood, fiberboard, particleboard, and glass reinforced concrete (GRC). The K 10 cutting tools were coated with monolayer titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN), multilayer TiAlN/titanium silicon nitride (TiSiN), and TiAlN/titanium boron <b>oxide</b> nitride (TiBON). <b>Cutting</b> tests {{were performed on}} computer numeric control router at a high cutting speed of 17 m/s and a feed rate of 0. 2 mm/rev to investigate the wear characteristics on the clearance face of these coated tools. Experimental {{results show that the}} coated tools experienced a smaller amount of clearance wear than the uncoated tool in cutting the mersawa wood, fiberboard, particleboard, and GRC. The GRC compared to the other work materials caused higher amount of clearance wear for both the uncoated and coated cutting tools. High content of silica and density were the reason for this phenomenon. The best coating among other coated cutting tools in this study was multilayer TiAlN/TiBON. The high hardness, low coefficient of friction, high resistance to oxidation, and high resistance to delamination wear of the multilayer-coated TiAlN/TiBON tool indicate a very promising applicability of this coating for high-speed cutting of abrasive woods and wood-based materials...|$|R
40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex {{processes}} in machining operation. Usually it is use for the finishing process to give the best surface finish and accurate dimension to the product by removing small amount of material on surface. It is important for the product because it will be influence to the quality of the product. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the surface roughness on the 1060 aluminum alloy when using different depth of cut, worktable speed and different type of wheel. The others purpose is to find the optimization parameters that effect to the surface roughness of the 1060 aluminum alloy. Precision surface grinding machine is use to grind the aluminum alloy. Taguchi method and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are use to analyze the result for experiments. From the result, it shows the highest worktable speed and depth of cut give the highest value of surface roughness for the aluminum oxide and silicon carbide. The lowest value of surface roughness gives the best surface finish. The most significant parameter when grinding 1060 aluminum alloy is worktable speed for aluminum <b>oxide.</b> Depth of <b>cut</b> is the significant factor when grinding using silicon carbide. The suitable wheel to grind aluminum alloy is silicon carbide it produce the lowest value of surface roughness.
