40|$|The high {{recidivism}} rate of Black male {{juvenile offenders}} {{is a problem}} in the United States that continues to be <b>of</b> great concern. <b>Probation</b> has gained popularity as being a means of addressing and reducing the high recidivism rates of juvenile offenders. However, {{there is a lack of}} research regarding Black male juvenile probationers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>probation</b> officers 2 ̆ 7 role in reducing their recidivism. This study examined the following: a) the predictive relationships between Black male probationers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>probation</b> officers, their perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>probation</b> officers 2 ̆ 7 job, and their recidivism within 3 years of being place on probation; and (b) Black male probationers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>probation</b> officers, their perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>probation</b> officers 2 ̆ 7 job, and their ratings <b>of</b> the <b>probation</b> officer 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in deterring their recidivism. Ecological systems theory was used as the theoretical foundation for guiding this research. Results from a logistic regression analysis showed that Black male probationers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>probation</b> officers and the job <b>of</b> their <b>probation</b> officers did not predict their recidivism. The study has implications for social change because the results provide empirical evidence regarding Black male probationer 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>probation</b> officers and recidivism. Human services professionals, leaders in the criminal justice field, and policy makers could use findings from the study to advocate for the need to develop training programs for probation officers that foster positive relationship building between probationers and probation officers. The positive relationships may subsequently bring social change by reducing recidivism among Black juvenile male offenders...|$|R

Lustick later successfully got the Washington fugitive action against Leaf dismissed with prejudice. On June 17, he posted a $45,000 bond in Washington state for the criminal charges in Texas. In April 2010, he pleaded guilty in Amarillo, Texas to seven counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and one count of delivery of a simulated controlled substance, all felonies.

5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period <b>of</b> <b>probation</b> before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial inspections, and conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E
