25|$|This slew {{of early}} successes may {{lie at the}} origin of the love professed for the team by the godfather of Italian sports journalists Gianni Brera (1919–92), who, despite having been born nowhere near Genoa, always {{declared}} himself a supporter of the team. Brera went as far as creating the nickname Vecchio Balordo (<b>Old</b> <b>Fool</b> or Cranky Old One) for Genoa.|$|E
25|$|Hawtrey {{acted in}} films {{from an early}} age, first {{appearing}} while still a child, and as an adult his youthful appearance and wit made him a foil to Will Hay's blundering <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> in the comedy films Good Morning, Boys (1937) and Where's That Fire? (1939). In all he appeared in more than 70 films, including from this period Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage (1936).|$|E
500|$|In March 1914 Formby {{appeared}} in No Fool Like an <b>Old</b> <b>Fool,</b> a 20-minute-long silent comedy film, which {{is thought to}} be lost; it was his only film appearance, and {{little is known about the}} plot or his character. When the First World War broke out in August that year, he tried to enlist, but was turned down on medical grounds; instead [...] he, like many music hall stars, was active in the recruiting campaign for the army and spoke at [...] rallies, particularly on behalf of the Derby Scheme.|$|E

500|$|Historian Paul Avrich {{describes}} the fallout over {{the support for}} the war an [...] "almost fatal" [...] division in the Russian anarchist movement. Muscovite anarchists split into two groups, with the larger faction supporting Kropotkin and his [...] "defensist" [...] associates; the smaller anti-war faction responded by abandoning Kropotkinite anarchist communism for anarcho-syndicalism. In spite of this, the anarchist movement in Russia continued to gain strength. In an article published in a December 1916 issue of The State and Revolution, Bolshevik leader Lenin accused the vast majority of Russian anarchists of following Kropotkin and Grave, and denounced them as [...] "anarcho-chauvinists". Similar remarks were made by other Bolsheviks, such as Joseph Stalin, who {{wrote in a letter to}} a Communist leader, [...] "I have recently read Kropotkin's articlesthe <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> must have completely lost his mind". Lenin protégé Leon Trotsky cited Kropotkin's {{support for the war}} and his manifesto while further denouncing anarchism: ...|$|E
500|$|More {{critical}} {{assessments of}} Markham's {{life and work}} were to follow. Hugh Robert Mill, Shackleton's first biographer and for many years the RGS librarian, referred to the dictatorial manner in which Markham had run the Society. In time, questions would be raised about the accuracy {{of some of his}} Hakluyt translations, and about the evidence of haste in the preparation of other publications. On a personal level he had made enemies as well as friends; Frank Debenham, the geologist who served with both Scott and Shackleton, called Markham [...] "a dangerous old man", while William Speirs Bruce wrote of Markham's [...] "malicious opposition to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition". Bruce's colleague Robert Rudmose-Brown went further, calling Markham [...] "that <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> and humbug". These protestations reflected Markham's protective attitude towards Scott; according to Bruce, [...] "Scott was Markham's protégé, and Markham thought it necessary, in order to uphold Scott, that I should be obliterated". He added that [...] "Scott and I were always good friends, in spite of Markham." [...] Markham's writings on naval history have been criticised by modern scholars due to his nationalistic exaggeration of English sailors' achievements in the Age of Discoveries.|$|E
500|$|A love {{triangle}} storyline between Audrey, Rita and Lewis then {{formed and}} was played out over Easter 2010. Rita hires Lewis {{to accompany her}} to a ball, despite knowing that her friend has fallen for him. Audrey becomes jealous when she tries to book Lewis herself and he explains someone has already hired him. Audrey attends the ball with a friend and is shocked to see Rita with Lewis. The two woman insult each other and Lewis and Rita leave. Susan Hill, writing for the Daily Star said that despite Lewis' apology for attending an event with Rita, Audrey is furious and confronts her friend. Rita tells Audrey she is [...] "acting like an <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> as Lewis can never be hers" [...] and Audrey slaps Rita across the face. Of Lewis' view of the situation, Havers commented, [...] "I think Lewis is genuinely concerned about Audrey. When Rita gets involved, he has to box clever, but he's very good at that." [...] Audrey decides to stop all contact with Lewis after realising she has {{fallen in love with}} him. Audrey's decision is prompted by her falling out with Rita and the fact she has read Lewis' diary, which contains details about his clients. Not wanting to get hurt by him, Audrey tells Lewis that she wants end their arrangement. Lewis is shocked and cannot understand why Audrey would want to stop seeing him. A show spokesperson commented, [...] "In the end she has to come clean and tell him how she really feels – which prompts Lewis to kiss her. He then tells her he's developed feelings for her too." [...] Audrey is shocked by the kiss and Lewis' declaration of love.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1940, Agnès Humbert and Jean Cassou, then {{employed}} at the Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires in Paris and finding {{they were to}} be replaced by German-approved staff, used a roneo machine belonging to the Museum to publish an open letter by Paul Rivet to Marshal Pétain. This was followed by their first tract, Vichy fait la guerre ('Vichy wages war'), written by Cassou. At the end of 1940, a group of 10, including Humbert, Cassou, Marcel Abraham and Claude Aveline founded a clandestine newsletter called Résistance, respecting and supporting De Gaulle but circumspect in references to [...] "that ridiculous <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> Pétain".

2500|$|Increasingly he lost {{influence}} to John Sharp, Archbishop of York, whom the Queen found far more congenial. He was a commissioner for the Union with Scotland in 1706; {{but in the}} last years of the Queen's reign was he [...] very much a secondary political figure, and from September 1710, though he was [...] still nominally a member of the Cabinet, ceased to attend its meetings. A strong supporter of the Hanoverian succession, who shocked many by referring to Anne's death as a blessing, he was one of three officers of state to whom, on the death of Anne, was entrusted the duty of appointing a regent till the arrival of George I, whom he crowned on 20 October 1714. [...] For the last time at the coronation of an English monarch, the [...] Archbishop asked if the people accepted their new King: the witty Catherine Sedley, former [...] mistress of James II, remarked [...] "Does the <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> think we will say no?" [...] Tenison died in London a year later. He was instrumental {{in the last years of}} his life in the literary executorship of Sir Thomas Browne's manuscript writings known as Christian Morals.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934 {{the chief}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Admiral Ernest King, offered Halsey command of the {{aircraft}} carrier , subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Captain Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. [...] "I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be {{at the mercy of the}} pilot." [...] Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, [...] "What do you think that the <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> is doing now? He's learning to fly!" [...] He went on to command the Saratoga, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, [...] "The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good." [...] Captain Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.|$|E
2500|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Fudge orchestrates {{a vicious}} smear {{campaign}} through the Daily Prophet to present Dumbledore as a senile <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> (even {{though he was}} constantly asking for Dumbledore's advice in his early days of being Minister for Magic) and Harry as an unstable, attention-seeking liar. He also passes a law allowing him to place Dolores Umbridge, his Senior Undersecretary, as a teacher at Hogwarts. He then appoints Umbridge as Hogwarts' [...] "High Inquisitor", {{with the power to}} inspect and sack teachers, and ultimately Dumbledore's successor as Headmaster, which gives her (and by extension, Fudge himself) primary control of how Hogwarts is managed. Fudge is concerned that Dumbledore is a threat to his power and that he is planning to train the Hogwarts students to overthrow the Ministry. After Voldemort appears in the Ministry of Magic at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Fudge finally admits that Voldemort has returned, and is sacked in disgrace from his position of Minister for Magic after the wizarding community calls for his resignation and is replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour, though he stays on as an advisor in Half-Blood Prince. Before his resignation, he makes several attempts to have Dumbledore arrange a meeting between himself and Harry so that Harry can lie on Fudge's behalf and make it look as though the Ministry is winning the war, but Dumbledore refuses, knowing how ridiculous Harry would find the idea. Fudge is last mentioned in the series as one of the attendees at Dumbledore's funeral; his fate during Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry during the following year is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|The character's first return storyline {{concentrated}} on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). [...] "Clare's a chancer," [...] explains Bissix, [...] "She sees Ian as a route to easy money!" [...] The Sun newspaper reported that [...] "Ian is mesmerised" [...] by Clare's attempts to lure {{him away from}} his wife Jane (Laurie Brett). Commenting on the storyline, Bissix said [...] "Clare knows Ian is married! But that makes it more of a challenge." [...] Eventually Clare's true motive was unearthed. After Ian nearly relented to her attempts at seduction, she proceeded to blackmail him. An EastEnders insider said: [...] "Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since {{she returned to the}} Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage just by being alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly <b>old</b> <b>fool</b> than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet." [...] However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to [...] "Stay away from Ian!". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: [...] "Poor Adam. He spent a day staring at my chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was around all the time when I was first here and we'd done scenes together. Now, instead of this snotty-nosed little girl making Nigel's tea, she was trying to seduce him and get him in his Y-fronts." ...|$|E
