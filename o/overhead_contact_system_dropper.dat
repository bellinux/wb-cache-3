40|$|Abstract. As the {{requirements}} for <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> line <b>systems</b> increase due to higher train speeds, the need of safety equipment for these systems increases as well. Developing a component for {{the case of a}} contact wire cut to prevent further damage from the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> line <b>system</b> requires an extensive knowledge about the system behaviour. Therefore, a comprehensive multi body system model (MBS) is developed in Matlab SimMechanics environment. In order to validate the datas generated from the simulations, a contact wire test stand has been constructed where cutting experiments can be run by releasing a pretensioned wire. Consequently, the force distribution during the contact wire cut is analyzed and these values are compared with the simulation results. For the comparisons, much attention is given to the period after the contact wire cut...|$|R

The exclusive use of the reserved platform by the tram is meant to provide greater regularity, speed and safety, and it only has contact with other vehicles at several existing at-grade intersections with the local street system. These intersections are regulated by traffic lights, which {{do not have the}} traffic signal preemption system fully operational, what would allow the tram to reach 20 km/h.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for detecting, locating and classifying <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>systems</b> (catenary systems) in point clouds collected by mobile mapping systems (MMS) on rail roads. Contrary {{to many other}} application types, railway embankments are highly regulated and standardized. Railway infrastructure geometric relations remain roughly unchanged within established regions and have similarities between them. The newly-developed method exploits both these characteristics, {{as well as the}} survey process. There are several steps in this approach. Firstly, it restricts the search for catenaries relative to the distance to registered MMS trajectory, then finds possible support structures according to the density of points above the track. Subsequently, the method verifies the structures‚Äô presence and classifies the points {{with the use of the}} RANSAC algorithm. It establishes the presence of cantilevers, as well as poles or structural beams, depending on the type of detected support structure. The method also determines the coordinates of the identified object on the ground. Finally, a classification is clarified with the use of a modified DBSCAN algorithm. The design method has been verified with data collected in four surveys where the cumulative length of the route was almost 90 km. Over 97 % of support structures were correctly detected, and out of these, over 95 % were completely classified...|$|R

The sensor-integrated RFID tags use solar cells and electric double layer capacitors for power supply. Low-price and high-performance solar cells have recently become available.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the 3 kV {{power supply system}} of Polish {{high-speed}} lines is described. Basic OCL parameters and test results of current collection quality is presented. One of the basic parameters limiting the maximum service speed on a given line is the pantograph-OCL cooperation quality. In this paper three types of <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> lines designed and implemented in Poland are described. There are also specified basic parameters and materials of catenaries, as well as OCL geometry or mechanical and electrical design values. The measured values obtained {{as a result of}} the performed tests are given in this paper which allows them to be compared with the design intents. One of the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> line <b>system</b> examples is an OCL system implemented on CMK mainline. The line was built in the 1970 s and nowadays is a backbone of Warsaw to Silesia rail connection. Today PKP provides 200 km/h commercial intercity services on this line. The CMK trunk line is commonly considered as a leading one on the Polish rail network. On this line several tests were performed which allowed the following two types of traction stock to enter service on the domestic network. The first of them was Siemens ES 64 U 4 electric locomotive and the second one was ED 250 Pendolino electric multiple unit, manufactured by Alstom Ferroviaria. All these tests were carried out according to the requirements described in Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) of Trans-European high-speed rail network for both Test pantograph and catenary on compliance with the TSI Energy and locomotives subsystems. During the Pendolino test runs two consecutive speed records were attained, first one (250. 1 km/h) by a modified FS ETR 460 train in 1994 and the latter (293 km/h) by a PKP ED 250 train in 2013. It is to be noticed that the speed records mentioned above were determined not only by the power supply system parameters but were dependent on other factors as well. During the test runs the current collection quality was checked, for both single-unit and multiple-unit operation. In this paper the results of pantograph-OCL cooperation are described, according to TSI ‚ÄúRolling stock‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù subsystems. These specifications state that the general current collection quality assessment criteria are the contact wire uplift and the contact force (calculated between a collector head and the contact wire) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Overhead</b> <b>contact</b> line {{equipment}} is important equipment that supplies power to trains. In order thus {{to maintain the}} soundness of the equipment, we inspect wearing depth of contact wires and positions (height and deviation) of <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> lines {{a few times a}} year using inspection cars. Some equipment, however, cannot be measured by inspection cars, so that is measured or just visually checked and manually measured only about once a year. One way to acquire accurate information of the condition of such equipment is by shortening the inspection period, but that would be quite difficult to implement due to a considerable increase in the amount of work. Furthermore, some items such as temperature of compression joints of feeders and displacement of springs of STBs constantly vary according to load current and weather. Depending on the timing of the inspection, {{we may not be able}} to check the items at their poorest condition. We thus developed an <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> {{line equipment}} monitoring system where equipment measurement devices attached to <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> lines periodically measure temperature and displacement and transmit that measurement data to trains running there in commercial operation.
