5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, {{the person of the}} subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality <b>of</b> <b>person.</b> Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E

If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances.

I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize?

5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son {{at the time of the}} punch. His wife recalls her and the children being treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to his home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster {{argued that}} a Coercion Act—which would punish those participated in events like those at Lough Mask, and would include the {{suspension}} of Habeas Corpus—should be introduced before any Land Act. Gladstone eventually accepted this argument. When Forster attempted to introduce the Protection <b>of</b> <b>Person</b> and Property Act 1881, Parnell and other Land League MP's attempted to obstruct its passage with tactics such as filibustering. One such filibuster lasted for 41 hours. Eventually, the Speaker of the house intervened, and a measure was introduced whereby the Speaker could control the house {{if there was a}} three to one majority in favour of the business being urgent. This {{was the first time that}} a check was placed on a debate in a British parliament. The act was passed on 28 February 1881. There was a negative reaction to the passing of the act in both England and Ireland. In England, the Anti-Coercion Association was established, which was a precursor to the Labour Party.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} inter-relationships among health, education, income, and health-related behaviour {{as measured by}} alcohol consumption and smoking. The cross-section models are estimated using data from Australia 2 ̆ 7 s sixty-one statistical regions to analyse multiple causal relationships among factors taken as endogenous. Classifying health indicators as 2 ̆ 7 no recent illness 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 no chronic condition 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 self-assessed good or excellent health 2 ̆ 7, ten models are presented and econometrically evaluated. The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth models take the proportions <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with no recent illness and no chronic conditions, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 15 years or over with post-school qualifications, and nominal gross annual median income <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 15 years or over, respectively, as endogenous. The inter-relationships among the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with no recent illness, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health, and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with moderate alcohol consumption are specified in the sixth, seventh, and eighth models. The proportions <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with cigarettes consumption and with excessive alcohol consumption are taken as endogenous in the ninth and tenth models. Diagnostic checks are conducted to evaluate ah the models. The tests include the non-nested tests, the tests of independence, the tests for endogeneity and exogeneity, the RESET tests for functional form misspecification, and the tests for heteroskedasticity. The parameter stability of the models is also tested and then (if any instability is apparent) parameter instability analysis is carried out. In addition, the direct, indirect, and total effects of variables exogenously determined in the individual models are manifested, since all the models are identified. The empirical evidence {{is consistent with the}} hypotheses that there are multiple inter-relationships (a) among the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with each <b>of</b> no recent illness and no chronic conditions, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 15 years or over with post-school qualifications and nominal gross annual median income <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 15 years or over, (b) among the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> with no recent illness, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with self-assessed good or excellent health and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with moderate alcohol consumption, and (c) between the proportions <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 years or over with cigarettes consumption and with excessive alcohol consumption...|$|R
