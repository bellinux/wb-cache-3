5|$|The mission {{plan called}} for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 121:28 mission elapsed time. On the {{original}} plan, {{this would have been}} at 7:44 UTC on September 4, 1983, before accounting for the last-minute launch delay; in the event, this was put back by one day to allow for further communications testing, and Challenger touched down at 07:40:33 UTC (00:40:33 PDT), September 5, 1983, on Runway 22 at Edwards AFB, {{on the morning of the}} seventh day of the mission. As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing <b>operational</b> <b>requirement</b> for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E

30|$|Most of the {{approaches}} that use specifications, such as formal methods, assume <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> to be given. However, deriving correct <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> from high-level goals is challenging {{and is often}} delegated to error-prone processes. Letier and Lamwsveerde [31] propose an iterative approach that allows for the derivation of <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> from high-level goals. In this work, goals are expressed in real-time linear temporal logic (RT-LTL). The approach is based on operationalisation patterns. Operationalization {{is a process that}} maps declarative property specifications to operational specifications satisfying them. The approach produces <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> in the form of pre-, post-, and trigger conditions. The approach is guaranteed to be correct, i.e., the conjunction of the <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> entails the goal specification in RT-LTL. The approach is limited to a collection of goals and requirement templates provided by the authors. Moreover, it needs a fully refined goal model that requires specific expertise and is a labour-intensive and error-prone process.|$|R

25|$|Although the Rotachute concept {{had proved}} to be practical, the <b>operational</b> <b>requirement</b> for such a machine never materialised. About eight Rotachutes were constructed, most being {{progressively}} converted to Mark III and then to Mark IV specifications.

40|$|Abstract—The {{process of}} {{requirements}} engineering includes many activities, from goal elicitation to requirements specification. The {{aim is to}} develop an <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> specification that is guaranteed to satisfy the goals. In this paper, we propose a formal, systematic approach for generating a set of <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> that are complete with respect to given goals. We show how the integration of model checking and inductive learning can be effectively used to do this. The model checking formally verifies the satisfaction of the goals and produces counterexamples when incompleteness in the <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> is detected. The inductive learning process then computes <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> from the counterexamples and user-provided positive examples. These learned <b>operational</b> <b>requirements</b> are guaranteed to eliminate the counterexamples and {{be consistent with the}} goals. This process is performed iteratively until no goal violation is detected. The proposed framework is a rigorous, tool-supported requirements elaboration technique which is formally guided by the engineer’s knowledge of the domain and the envisioned system. Index Terms—Requirements elaboration, goal operationalisation, behaviour model refinement, model checking, inductive learning. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{origins of}} the Type 432 lay with a {{requirements}} set out in 1939 for twin-engined fighters with 20 or possibly 40mm cannon. Vickers had set out {{a proposal for a}} Griffon-engined aircraft, equipped with a 40mm cannon in a flexible mounting. This was subsequently encouraged by the Air Ministry. Further development was carried out for a design that could also meet F.6/39 for a fixed gun fighter with 20mm cannon. Specification F.22/39 was drawn up to cover the 40mm project as the Vickers 414 to meet <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirement</b> (OR) 76.|$|E

25|$|Buoyancy {{changes with}} depth {{variation}} are {{proportional to the}} compressible part {{of the volume of}} the diver and equipment, and to the proportional change in pressure, which is greater per unit of depth near the surface. Minimising the volume of gas required in the buoyancy compensator will minimise the buoyancy fluctuations with changes in depth. This can be achieved by accurate selection of ballast weight, which should be the minimum to allow neutral buoyancy with depleted gas supplies {{at the end of the}} dive unless there is an <b>operational</b> <b>requirement</b> for greater negative buoyancy during the dive.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, the Air Staff's {{preferred}} turret-equipped night fighter {{design to}} <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirement</b> O.R 95 was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from their F.9/37). However, although in agreement as {{to the quality of}} the Gloster company's design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently, in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito, when fitted with a turret would be considered for the night fighter requirement.|$|E

25|$|Designed by W. E. W. Petter, the Gnat has {{its origins}} in the {{preceding}} private venture Folland Midge. The issuing of <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirement</b> OR.303 by the British Air Ministry served to motivate the type's development, the Gnat was later submitted to meet this requirement. Its design allowed for its construction and maintenance tasks {{to be carried out}} without specialised tools, making it suitable for use in countries that had not yet become highly industrialised. The Gnat has been viewed as a major motivating factor towards the issuing of the NATO NBMR-1 requirement, which sought to make available a common strike/attack light fighter with which to equip the air forces of the various NATO members.|$|E
25|$|According to Fairey's projections, the ER.103/B {{could have}} been ready to fly within {{eighteen}} months of having received an order, while the ER.103/C could reach the same readiness within 30 months. In particular, Fairey pursued <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirement</b> F.155, which called for a two-seat fighter equipped with radar and missiles with suitable performance to achieve an altitude of 60,000 feet and Mach 2 within six minutes of taking off; while the company thought the firm thought that their design {{would be able to}} fully capable of meeting the specified requirements, it was believed that the complete weapon system would not be fully developed until 1962. Thus, Fairey proposed that a simpler interim aircraft, if selected, could be available by 1960 or potentially earlier.|$|E
25|$|At one point, the Avro 776 looked set {{to win the}} {{competition}} to be selected as the RAF's new maritime patrol aircraft. However, due to a desire to cut costs, the RAF decided to issue an entirely new <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirement,</b> under which the demands for speed, endurance, and capacity had all been diminished. As {{a result of the}} changed requirement, the design team was recalled and the Avro 776 was entirely sidelined for a new proposal. This new proposal, based upon the de Havilland Comet's fuselage, {{had little to do with}} the Trident save for the use of its existing Spey engines; this would go on to be selected and procured as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. As a result of this loss, prospects for an enlarged Trident equipped with more powerful engines effectively evaporated.|$|E

25|$|In May 1951, {{faced with}} {{reports on the}} {{increasingly}} potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation's newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an <b>Operational</b> <b>Requirement,</b> OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of 60,000ft (18,300 m) in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the performance requirement laid out by OR 301 {{was due to the}} anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers might well be capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as 80,000ft. Avro's design team promptly set about designing an suitable interceptor that conformed with the specification's requirements, which would result in the Avro 720 proposal. In addition, various other proposals from a number of companies were received, including Bristol, Blackburn, Shorts and Saunders-Roe.|$|E
25|$|Strict {{enforcement}} of anti-arm laws {{which are in}} existence in Singapore since 1823 {{has resulted in a}} relatively disarmed society, where firearms-related crimes are rare. It is therefore not an <b>operational</b> <b>requirement</b> for police officers to wear bullet resistant vests when conducting normal policing duties. However, vests, helmets, and shields are carried in police vehicles and stocked in police establishments and can be rapidly utilize should the situation require it. In addition, chemical protection equipment such as suit, gloves, boots and NBC masks etc. are readily available to be drawn from the maintenance stores. Special units such as the KINS unit are known for utilising the skeletal battle order vest as a direct alternative to the ops kit belt for as they are issued with firearm magazines while on duty. From 2004, new multi-purpose vests were introduced which offer officers protection against most handgun fire, knife thrusts, as well as doubling up as a buoyancy vest should officers fall into deep water.|$|E
