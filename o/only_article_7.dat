40|$|<b>Articles</b> <b>7</b> and 8 of the TRIPS Agreement are {{a set of}} treaty {{norms that}} provide express {{recognition}} for policy objectives that are fundamental to international intellectual property protection. Not only do they identify the goals of technological innovation and dissemination, they also acknowledge the wider public interest behind the Agreement. Given the content of <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> and 8, {{it is not surprising}} that these provisions are regarded as important interpretative devices that permit a contextual view of the TRIPS Agreement, such that Member States can tailor their intellectual property laws to suit national levels of development. Within the WTO, <b>Articles</b> <b>7</b> and 8 have acquired influence at the policy level through the Doha Ministerial Declaration and the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Yet, these provisions have received only limited recognition from the Dispute Settlement Body. Hence the importance of the 2001 decision in US-s 2 JJ Omnibus Appropriations Act 1998, where the Panel identified <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> as an expression of the good faith principle. In this capacity, not <b>only</b> does <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> function as an interpretative device' also requires substantive compliance, operating as an effective source of law. Beyond the TRIPS Agreement <b>Articles</b> <b>7</b> and 8 have been utilised within the WIPO Development Agenda and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. This, together with increasing recognition at the domestic level, has resulted in an enhanced status within the wider policy arena and an enhanced legal status, such that the interpretation and application of <b>Articles</b> <b>7</b> and 8 is now beyond the exclusive control of the WTO. Consequently, as policy instruments, interpretative devices or substantive rules, <b>Articles</b> <b>7</b> and 8 defend a perspective on intellectual property regulation that is fully supportive of social as well as economic development in all participating nations whatever their stage of development.

40|$|Introduction: The snoring is {{produced}} by the vibration of the soft palatum and/or other oropharyngeal tissues, during the air passage, in the breathing function. OSAHS {{is defined as the}} closing of 30 %, at least, of the nasal/ buccal airway for 10 seconds or more, in spite of existing inspiratory effort, accompanied by oxyhemoglobin de- saturation of 4 % or more. Objectives: To evaluate the available scientific evidence about the use of mandibular advancement intraoral appliances in the treatment of the snoring and/or OSAHS. Methodology: Electronic search strategy using predefined key-words and criteria was realized including studies published until October of 2008. It was also used the qualitative evaluation of the articles methodology. Results: Although a significant number of articles has studied this subject, <b>only</b> <b>7</b> <b>articles</b> showed methodological quality to be included in this systematic review. Conclusions: The intraoral appliances are widely prescribed for the treatment of snoring and OSAHS as primary therapy and as an alternative to patients who are unable to tolerate the positive airway pressure therapy...|$|R
40|$|Substance misuse {{in people}} with {{psychosis}} presents significant problems, but trials of treatments to address it show little sustained advantage over control conditions. An examination of mechanisms underpinning unassisted improvements may assist in the refinement of co-morbidity treatments. This study reviewed existing research on natural recovery from substance misuse {{in people with}} psychosis. To address this issue, a systematic search identified <b>only</b> <b>7</b> <b>articles</b> that fulfilled the criteria. Their results suggest that people with psychosis report similar reasons to change as do non-psychotic groups, although they did not clarify whether the relative frequencies or priority orders were the same. Differences involved issues relating to the disorder and the functional problems faced by this group: receipt of treatment for mental health difficulties, worsening of mental health difficulties, and homelessness. The current research on reasons for change in people with psychosis is sparse and has significant limitations, and as yet it offers little inspiration for new treatments. A more fertile source {{may prove to be}} a detailed investigation of successful substance control strategies that are used in self-management by this group...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: oropharyngeal {{dysphagia}} {{in patients}} with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. PURPOSE: patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be vulnerable to respiratory incompetence {{that may lead to}} swallowing impairment. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the relationship between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Forty-seven articles were retrieved relating to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and dysphagia. Each article was graded using evidence-based methodology. <b>Only</b> <b>7</b> <b>articles</b> out of the 47 addressed oropharyngeal swallowing disorders {{in patients with}} Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. This review found few studies that documented the relationship between oropharyngeal swallowing disorders and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. There were no randomized control trials. CONCLUSION: although the evidence is not strong, it appears that patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease are prone to oropharyngeal dysphagia during exacerbations. Future studies are needed to document the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in homogeneous groups of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and to assess the relationship between respiration and swallowing using simultaneous measures of swallowing biomechanics and respiratory function. These investigations will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the characteristics and risk factors of developing oropharyngeal dypshagia in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{translate}} evidence-based literature into policy and practice guidelines {{in order to improve}} leadership standards and skills among nurse managers and improve patient outcomes and the quality of care. Guided by the American Nurses Credentialing Center Magnet Model and Lewin 2 ̆ 7 s change theory, which sets the framework for creating exceptional nursing leaders, a literature search was conducted from studies ranging from 2010 to 2012 from several databases. Inclusion criteria were based on the presence of one or more leadership styles discussed in the articles and the impact of leadership style on nursing satisfaction. A total of 25 articles were found during the electronic search, but <b>only</b> <b>7</b> <b>articles</b> met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The results of this review revealed that transformational leadership enhanced nursing satisfaction rates, while transactional leadership and situational leadership contributed to low levels of nursing satisfaction rates. This project contributes to positive social change for nurse managers because there is limited research available that focuses on leadership styles and its implication for practice. This project will inform the work of nurse managers by illuminating the importance of leadership styles on nursing satisfaction and work environment conditions...|$|R
40|$|The European Union's Energy Efficiency Directive {{calls for}} EU Member States {{to put in}} place ambitious energy {{efficiency}} policies and requires them to establish energy saving targets. One of the most important Articles of the Directive is <b>Article</b> <b>7,</b> which required Member States to implement Energy Efficiency Obligations and/or alternative policy instruments in order to reach a reduction in final energy use of 1. 5 % per year. This paper assesses how <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> has been applied by Member States and what the implications are. Analysing the plans of all 28 Member States we evaluate how <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> is implemented across the EU. This includes an analysis of the types of policies used, the distribution of the anticipated savings across the different policy instruments, and whether or not the way <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> is applied in reality meets the requirements set by the Directive. Our analysis shows that Member States take very different approaches with some using up to 112 policy measures and others just one. We also identify areas of concern particularly related to the delivery of the energy savings with respect to the <b>Article</b> <b>7</b> requirements, the calculation methods, and the monitoring and verification regimes adopted by Member States. We model to what extent the projected savings are likely to materialise {{and whether or not they}} will be sufficient to meet the target put forward by <b>Article</b> <b>7.</b> In our paper we also make suggestions for modifying the Energy Efficiency Directive in order to address some of the problems we encountered...|$|R
