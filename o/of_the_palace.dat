5|$|The Palace of Frets {{is located}} on the fourth terrace of the Acropolis. The south facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> is {{decorated}} with four large stepped frets. On the east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco. One of the rooms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} {{buildings}} follows ancient customs laid down in the Classic of Rites. Thus, ancestral temples are in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> Storage areas are placed in the front part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> complex, and residences in the back.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> buildings {{had been burned}} down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to this {{there are many other}} brick monuments from different eras. <b>The</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> los Gutierrez de Altamirano, <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> militia, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> Cárdenas, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> río Ungria, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> real, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> Ballesteros Ronquillo, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> Sedeño and <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> <b>of</b> general Vicente del Río. There are also diverse convents, the castle in which <b>the</b> museum <b>of</b> cereal resides, plaza del Arrabal plaza Del Real, plaza de San Pedro and plaza de la Villa.|$|R

5|$|Prince Rainier III was {{responsible}} for not only turning around the fortune and reputation of Monaco but also for overseeing the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French revolution, was rebuilt. This is the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> where the ruling family have their private apartments. The wing also houses the Napoleon Museum and the archives.|$|E

5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected at the entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front lawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace,</b> which {{was used by the}} musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace. Other notable rooms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E

5|$|Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{began on}} May 6, 1782, at {{the order of}} King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), {{the founder of the}} Chakri Dynasty, when he moved the capital city from Thonburi to Bangkok. Throughout {{successive}} reigns, many new buildings and structures were added, especially during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). By 1925, the king, the Royal Family and the government were no longer permanently settled at the palace, and had moved to other residences. After the abolition of absolute monarchy in 1932, all government agencies completely moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the mid-Heian period, {{the palace}} {{suffered}} several fires and other disasters. During reconstructions, emperors {{and some of}} the office functions resided outside the palace. This, along with the general loss of political power of the court, acted to further diminish the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> as the administrative centre. Finally in 1227 the palace burned down and was never rebuilt. The site was built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings, and limited excavations conducted mainly since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the {{pierhead}} {{was extended}} {{under the supervision}} of Birch's nephew, Peregrine, who added a pavilion with a capacity for 1400 people.

5|$|On the {{southwest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> courtyard {{there were some}} low platforms, possibly ritual dance platforms, and on the southeast side was a building with benches against three of the walls and hearths at each end.

5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted {{in their use of}} the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected in the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E
