500|$|Saunders {{went to work}} in {{the logging}} {{industry}} in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, [...] "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire {{to do something about the}} Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. [...] "They can take all the blood they want from me," [...] Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, [...] "and they'll never find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am– least of all an Aborigine– bloody stupid!" ...|$|E

My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors." ...|$|E

[...] The match was lost by Evert in 26, 64, 16, which Evert amassed 25 {{unforced}} errors mostly due to a poor forehand shot, and her serve was not much better having made six double faults. [...] Evert said of her poor showing that [...] "I could not reach deep inside of myself and pull <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> needed to win the match." ...|$|E

[...] She added a year later: [...] "Marriage has never been a big deal for me...But I think I’m ready now...I got to have all the fun in the world, to experience {{a lot of people and}} figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> really like." [...] Delany (in 1988) said she doesn't find being a celebrity to be that appealing: [...] "I'm not a 'personality'. I am never recognized, which I take as a compliment.

2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|The rape was {{revisited}} in 1998 when Luke and Laura's son, Lucky, {{finds out}} about the incident. This time, the writers scripted it as rape instead of a seduction. Lucky struggled {{to come to terms}} with the revelation while Luke and Laura dealt with the unresolved issues surrounding the rape. In a 2000 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Geary said, for the taping of the scenes, [...] "Alan Pultz, who had directed the rape originally, used his original notes and directed me that day to recall all of that. I was able to finally put <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think is Luke's definitive statement: that it was rape, it was ugly, he'd probably never recover." [...] He added, [...] "I was grateful that the directors and the writers were interested in what Luke's experience was and didn't try to spin it for audience control." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sound the Alarm is {{the first}} album in a trilogy with the theme of self-discovery. It was {{followed}} by Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was [...] "an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance." [...] He {{also said that the}} three-album concept was: [...] "just a bit of a therapeutic experiment". I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn’t really deal with the world or myself. So I was just like this has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 Stieglitz read a {{commentary}} about his photography by Waldo Frank that suggested {{the strength of}} his imagery was {{in the power of the}} individuals he photographed. Stieglitz was outraged, believing Frank had at best ignored his many photographs of buildings and street scenes, and at worst had accused him of being a simple recorder of what appeared in front of him. He resolved immediately to begin a new series of cloud studies [...] "to show that (the success of) my photographs (was) not due to subject matter – not to special trees or faces, or interiors, to special privileges – clouds were there for everyone…" [...] He said [...] "I wanted to photograph clouds to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had learned in forty years about photography. Through clouds to put down my philosophy of life –…My aim is increasingly to make my photographs look so much like photographs that unless one has eyes and sees, they won't be seen – and still everyone will never forget them having once looked at them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 27, 2011, Pippen {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of criticism by saying that Miami Heat star LeBron James may be a better player than Michael Jordan. This came only a day after the Heat beat the Bulls 4 games to 1 to advance to the 2011 NBA Finals. Pippen said: [...] "Michael Jordan is probably the greatest scorer to ever play the game. I may go so far as saying LeBron James may be the greatest player to ever play the game." [...] Pippen faced a backlash from Bulls fans after his comments, and even former teammates such as Horace Grant who stated in a radio interview: [...] "Wow, Pippen's my man, and we'll always be close, but I totally disagree. LeBron {{is going to be one}} of the top players to ever play the game, but Michael Jeffrey Jordan, who we bumped heads at times, is I think, the best basketball player I've ever seen." [...] In a later interview on the radio show Kap & Haugh Pippen stated: [...] "No, I did not say I would take LeBron over Michael. The reality is you need to go back and figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing wrong.

2500|$|Then on 29 May Brooke {{was ordered}} by Gort {{to return to}} England, leaving the Corps in Montgomery's hands. According to Montgomery, Brooke was so {{overcome}} with emotion at having to leave his men in such a crisis that [...] "he broke down and wept" [...] as he handed over to Monty on the beaches of La Panne. He was told by Gort to proceed home .... for (the) task of reforming new armies so returned on a destroyer (30 May).

He had already realised that there was no hope of success for the Brittany plan (Breton redoubt) [...] to keep an allied redoubt in France. He told the Secretary for War (Eden) that the mission had no military value and no hope of success although he could not comment on its political value. In his first conversation with Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Brooke had been rung by Dill who was at 10 Downing Street) he insisted that all British forces should be withdrawn from France. Churchill initially objected but was eventually convinced by Brooke and around 200,000 British and Allied troops were successfully evacuated from ports in northwestern France.|$|E
2500|$|Giles and O'Keefe {{have been}} criticized for {{accuracy}} problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would call some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Bernadino employee at ACORN explains {{that there is no way}} ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: [...] " [...] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." [...] He asked, [...] "s that what you think a pimp looks like?" [...] O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, [...] "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?" ...|$|E
