60|$|The saloon {{stood on}} a corner. The hour was eight o'clock. Homefarers and <b>outgoers</b> jostled Curly on the narrow stone sidewalk. Between the {{buildings}} to his left he looked down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare. The alley was dark except for one patch of light. Where there was light there were sure to be human beings. Where there were human beings after nightfall in San Antonio there might be food, and there was sure to be drink. So Curly headed for the light.|$|R
60|$|The {{porter and}} his wife act as domestics to such of the inmates of the mansion as do not keep servants; making their beds, {{arranging}} their rooms, lighting their fires, and doing other menial offices, for which they receive a monthly stipend. They are also in confidential intercourse with the servants of the other inmates, and, having an eye on all the incomers and <b>outgoers,</b> are thus enabled, by hook and by crook, to learn the secrets and domestic history of {{every member of the}} little territory within the porte-cochère.|$|R
2500|$|Under the First Wilson Government, {{subsidies}} for farmers were increased. Farmers {{who wished to}} leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not. A Small Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, 40,000 more farmers became eligible for the maximum £1,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous [...] "disturbance compensation." [...] A Hill Land Improvement Scheme, introduced by the Agriculture Act of 1967, provided 50% grants {{for a wide range}} of land improvements, along with a supplementary 10% grant on drainage works benefitting hill land. The Agriculture Act 1967 also provided grants to promote farm amalgamation and to compensate <b>outgoers.</b>|$|R
