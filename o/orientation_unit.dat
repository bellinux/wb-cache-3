P. and Rey A. D., J. Phys. II France 4 (1994) 645]. Numerical and analytical solutions of the director triad (n, m, l), and uniaxial (S) and biaxial (P) alignments are given. The unit sphere description of the director triad is used to discuss and analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} director triad trajectories and the coupled alignment (uniaxial and biaxial) relaxations to the initial orientation, nematic potential (U), and to the alignment Deborah number (dimensionless extension rate). The evolution of the director triad is given by the rotation of a moving diad (n, l) around a fixed director (m). When the poles of the <b>orientation</b> <b>unit</b> sphere are along the extension axis, and the equator lies in the compression plane of the flow, it is found that the director diad (n, l) dynamics follow geodesic flow and the trajectories belong to the same meridians (great circles through the poles). The space of stable steady state orientation of the uniaxial director n and the biaxial director m is the whole compression plane (the equator of the unit sphere), while that of the biaxial director l is the extension direction (poles). A high degree extension flow-induced biaxiality is found when the uniaxial director is away from the extension axis and when S is relatively low. The scalar order parameter couplings are captured by analyzing the trajectories in the alignment triangle. Computed scientific visualizations of biaxial molecular orientation distributions are used to correlate the director triad dynamics and the alignment's dynamics. The tensor order parameter is used to calculate the main flow-birefringences, thus providing a direct way to verify the theoretical predictions of this paper...|$|E

More specifically, the instructional unit I s effect on the number of processes and key processes utilized, the number of correct solutions, and the number of computational errors made was investigated. [...] The sample consisted of 10 students enrolled in a grade 10 mathematics course designed for low ability students. The textbook for this course was Consumer Related Mathematics. (Kravitz and Brant, 1971) [...] A test consisting of 10 routine word problems was administered to each student individually as a pretest. Students were asked to verbalize their thoughts as they attempted to reach solutions to the problems, and the interviews were recorded on cassette tapes. Following the pretest the results of each student’s performance was coded using the coding sheet. [...] A calculator <b>orientation</b> <b>unit</b> and an instructional unit were devised for use in the study. The primary purpose of the calculator-orientation unit was to instruct students on proper calculator usage and the calculator’s relationship to problem solving. A class set of calculators (Model TI- 1035) was provided for each class period. The {{main purpose of}} the instructional unit was to teach students key processes to be used in problem solving, and how these processes could be applied to different types of problems. The emphasis when teaching the unit was on these key processes with particular attention given to those processes in which students exhibited weaknesses. The duration of the instructional period, including the calculator-orientation unit, was four weeks. Following the instructional unit, students were administered a parallel form of the pretest as a posttest. Students' performances were recorded individually on a cassette tape, and the results coded on the coding sheet. [...] Significant gains were reported on a number of key processes utilized by students following instruction. Significant gains were also made in the number of correct solutions. Also, a significant decrease in the number of computational errors made was reported. [...] An important observation made from the study was that allowing students to verbalize their thoughts while solving routine words problems provides a basis for instruction directed towards the specific weaknesses of the students involved. Recommendations were made that the study be replicated in other geographical areas, with larger samples and with students of differing abilities. Also the long-term effects of such units need to be investigated. ...|$|E

Persons subjected to the survey were residents, prisoners (colonists) in the penal colony and in some areas, primary school children. The spleen rate was examined by manual palpation in children under 12 years. Results obtained were summarized as follows: 1) The parasite rate was 2. 5 % (8 / 320) at Wawa, 0. 5 % (1 / 217) at Sonlon, 4. 0 % (16 / 401) at Maruyogon, 15. 4 % (10 / 65) at Mainit, 26. 7 % (8 / 30) in the native tribe and 5. 7 % (2 / 35) in settlers, and 7. 1 % (21 / 181) in school children at Quezon. 2) The spleen rate was 4. 0 % (7 / 177) at Maruyogon, 40. 9 % (18 / 44) at Mainit and 15. 2 % (34 / 224) at Quezon. 3) In the Iwahig Penal Colony, colonists in the Montible and Central Subcolonies were employed for the parasite examination. The parasite rate in the Montible was 12. 1 %(62 / 521).

Our focus here is on the design of a virtual learning space for the module. Our design is informed by the literature and reflection on our own practice. It was implemented {{under the auspices of the}} University’s VLE policy and strategy. Both the module and the learning environment in which it was implemented were new in September 2008. This posed some interesting challenges which will be explored in the paper. The module was developed in response to a perceived need for colleagues to experience, study and reflect on e-learning. Development work was supported by a CASQ secondment. We have now had one complete run through of the module (September 2008 to January 2009) and have started on the second. Together, we developed the module and are the only tutors teaching on it at this time. Much of the development work was undertaken during the academic year 2007 - 08, but the learning space was set up in September 2008. A unique feature of this module is that, apart from an introductory face to face session, it takes place entirely online. In this paper we discuss what we wanted to do (content and tools), how we wanted to do it (including layout and tools), the constraints that the new VLE imposed and the opportunities that it offered. We want to reflect on what people have said about the module in their evaluations and also in their formative comments in the <b>orientation</b> <b>unit.</b> We can also draw from many rich sources of primary data, both quantitative and qualitative, much of which derive from the VLE and its associated tools eg document access statistics, copies of Chat sessions, records of Discussions, and Blogs. In addition, of course, we have our own experiences and personal blogs to draw from. The guiding principle behind the learning and teaching strategy is one of construction of knowledge through discussion. The module uses the discussion forum tool in particular along with other collaborative technologies – both synchronous and asynchronous. The ethical considerations in presenting such a paper will require us to anonymised content or seek permission from participants. At the time of writing, it is still too early to draw firm conclusions though we can state now that it has been time-consuming, exciting, challenging and frustrating. We have learned a great deal from implementing the module for its first run at the same time as the launch of NOW and this paper will, we hope, inform colleagues on the generalisable aspects of the use of the learning space. ...|$|E

Microstructures consisting of very fine ferrite grains (3 μm) and submicron cementite particles are produced at strain levels larger than ε = 1. 5. The initial grains undergo progressive fragmentation by the generation of low angle boundaries (LABs) by dynamic recovery that progressively transform into high angle boundaries (HABs). The progressive increase of LABs misorientation is attributed {{to the presence of}} cementite particles and is referred to as continuous dynamic recrystallization (cDRX). Fine prior austenite grain size and moderate strain rates are found to promote the occurrence of cDRX. The resulting torsion textures consist of a strong 〈 111 〉 fiber dominated by the D { 112 } 〈 111 〉 component. During the subsequent annealing step, cementite particles coarsen preferentially at the triple junctions whereas the very fine ferrite grain are stable due to the strong pinning effect exerted by the cementite particles.
