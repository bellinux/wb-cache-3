5|$|Charles of Bavaria needed {{military}} assistance {{to take the}} imperial title by force, which he secured the treaty of Nymphenburg (July 1741). During the subsequent War of the Austrian Succession, he successfully captured Prague, where he was crowned King of Bohemia. He invaded Upper Austria, planning to capture Vienna, but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected their troops into Bohemia, where Frederick the Great, himself newly King of Prussia, had taken advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chaos</b> in Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.|$|E

Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E

30|$|Our {{uncertainty}} quantification {{is based}} on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansion (PCE). <b>The</b> homogeneous polynomial <b>chaos</b> was introduced in [46] for Gaussian probability distributions.

40|$|A novel {{polynomial}} chaos proxy-based history matching {{and uncertainty}} quantification method is presented {{that can be}} employed for complex geological structures in inverse problems. For complex geological structures, when there are many unknown geological parameters with highly nonlinear correlations, typically more than 106 full reservoir simulation runs might be required to accurately probe the posterior probability space given <b>the</b> production history <b>of</b> reservoir. This is not practical for high-resolution geological models. One solution {{is to use a}} "proxy model" that replicates the simulation model for selected input parameters. <b>The</b> main advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy compared to other proxy models and response surfaces is that it is generally applicable and converges systematically as <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expansion increases. The Cameron and Martin theorem 2. 24 states that <b>the</b> convergence rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansions is exponential for Gaussian random variables. To improve the convergence rate for non-Gaussian random variables, <b>the</b> generalized polynomial <b>chaos</b> is implemented that uses an Askey-scheme to choose the optimal basis for polynomial chaos expansions [199]. Additionally, for the non-Gaussian distributions that can be effectively approximated by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, we use the mixture-modeling based clustering approach where under each cluster <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy converges exponentially fast and the overall posterior distribution can be estimated more efficiently using different polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxies. <b>The</b> main disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy is that for high-dimensional problems, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> terms increases drastically as <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansions increases. Although different non-intrusive methods have been developed in the literature to address this issue, still a large number of simulation runs is required to compute high-order terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansions. This work resolves this issue by proposing <b>the</b> reduced-terms polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansion which preserves only the relevant terms in <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> representation. We demonstrated that the sparsity pattern in <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> expansion, when used with the Karhunen-Loéve decomposition method or kernel PCA, can be systematically captured. A probabilistic framework based on <b>the</b> polynomial <b>chaos</b> proxy is also suggested in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bayesian model selection to study <b>the</b> plausibility <b>of</b> different geological interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sedimentary environments. The proposed surrogate-accelerated Bayesian inverse analysis can be coherently used in practical reservoir optimization workflows and uncertainty assessments...|$|R
5|$|Revolution {{broke out}} in St. Petersburg {{in the spring of}} 1917. At the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chaos,</b> Maria and her {{siblings}} were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at Gatchina, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major source of support to her mother. Maria went outside with her mother on the night of March 13, 1917 to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and nearly died. She was not told that her father had abdicated the throne until after she began to recover.|$|E

Once there, he battles a robotic imposter before taking on Robotnik, who is piloting a giant mech. Sonic manages to defeat the robot and it explodes, damaging the Death Egg and knocking it out of orbit. Sonic {{falls to the ground}} and is saved by Tails in the Tornado.

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes.

In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed.
