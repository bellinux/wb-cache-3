40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of foreign exchange <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> on exchange rate and stock market changes, in particular to examine the forecasting power of <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> and better {{understand the nature of}} the private information conveyed in <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> in the foreign exchange market. Chapter 1 investigates the performance of foreign exchange customer <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> (six major exchange rates over 3. 5 years) as an additional explanatory variable to technical analysis to forecast exchange rate changes by applying genetic algorithm non-linear methodology. Using the interval permutations technique, we suggest that the improvement of <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> to the performance of technical analysis is not consistently present. Chapter 2 examines the role daily customer GBPUSD <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> play in explaining concurrent and future stock market changes in both UK and US, and discusses the heterogeneous effects from different groups of customers. The basic hypothesis tested is that if foreign exchange <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> have days-ahead effects on future stock market changes, it suggests that at least a part of the information carried by foreign exchange <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> is relevant for stock markets. Using daily GBPUSD <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> over 3. 5 years from 2002 to 2006 provided by RBS, we find that: 1) impacts of <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> from corporate customers on stock markets are positive, while impacts of <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> from unleveraged financial institutions are negative; 2) impacts of corporate <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> are longer than those of financial <b>order</b> <b>flows,</b> especially for the US stock market, suggesting that the two groups of customers may hold different types of private price-relative information. We hypothesize that corporate customers of the bank are mainly based in the UK. When the world economy is doing well, multi-national companies are selling more goods in the US and repatriate more foreign currencies back to UK, during which more GBP or EUR are converted from US Dollars. More sales of US Dollars then reflect the good future prospects of the world economy and stocks listed in both US and UK will rise in value. For unleveraged financial institutions, when the world economy is going bad, clients of those mutual funds which are based in the UK will ask for redemptions of their funds. Assuming the bank services a client base that is UK oriented, this leads to the repatriation of money from abroad back to UK. The buying of GBP or EUR in exchange for US Dollars then takes place alongside sales of US and UK stocks. Foreign exchange flows into GBP or EUR from unleveraged funds forecast poor future stock market returns globally. Chapter 3 empirically tests the effects of EURUSD <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> from different groups of counterparties on the US stock market changes at high frequencies ranging from 1 -minute to 30 -minute, using a unique set of tick-by-tick <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> data obtained from a leading European commercial bank. We find that: 1) <b>Order</b> <b>flows</b> from “corporates” are positively related to exchange rate changes, while <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> from “financials” are negatively signed, which contradict many well-documented papers such as Evans and Lyons (2002 a) (this high frequency forecasting power partly explain the failure of the trading strategy based on our daily <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> data in chapter); 2) The effects of <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> from “financials” are negative on stock market changes, while the effects of orders from “corporates” are positive on stock market changes, which further confirms our findings in chapter 2. Similar to chapter 2, the cross market effects documented in chapter 3 also suggest that there is information content in foreign exchange <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> and that {{it is likely to be}} macroeconomic in nature, relevant for stock markets. Chapter 4 concludes and suggests some directions of refinements and further research...|$|R

50|$|Payment for <b>order</b> <b>flow</b> was a {{practice}} pioneered by Bernard Madoff, {{and the practice}} has long been controversial. However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing payment for <b>order</b> <b>flow,</b> the New York Stock Exchange sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow payment for <b>order</b> <b>flow</b> on its electronic exchange(s).The NYSE is proposing to pay for limit orders {{in order to put}} more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of payment for <b>order</b> <b>flow</b> that pays only for market orders. Payment for <b>order</b> <b>flow</b> has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the tick size and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, payments for <b>order</b> <b>flow</b> were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent. Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of E-Trade's transaction revenue came from payment for <b>order</b> <b>flow,</b> but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.|$|E

In particular, liquidity is intimately connected with the fundamental building blocks of finance, namely, the pricing of risk, the powerful no-arbitrage theorems, and market efficiency. Large-sample studies of liquidity show that both liquidity and liquidity risk are priced in the cross-section of stock returns, the law of one price {{is more likely to}} hold in more liquid markets, and liquidity enhances market efficiency. Hence policies to enhance liquidity encourage efficiency and reduce costs of raising capital. Furthermore, <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> are powerful predictors of returns as well as the real economy.

40|$|In a Kyle (1985) model, {{the sign}} of the {{correlation}} between a firm’s debt and equity returns is the same as {{the sign of}} the cross-market Kyle’s lambda. The sign is positive (negative) if private information concerns the mean (risk) of the firm’s assets. We show empirically that information conveyed by <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> is primarily about asset means. The cross-market lambdas are quite large; consequently, the portions of bond and stock returns explained by <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> are highly correlated, even though the <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> themselves are virtually uncorrelated. (JEL G 12, G 14) Because they are derivatives with monotone payoffs written on a firm’s assets, the prices of corporate debt and equity claims should respond in the same direction to information about the mean value of a firm’s assets, but, because the bond payoff is concave and the stock payoff convex, they should respond in opposite directions to information about the risk of a firm’s assets.

To do so we carry out empirical analysis of the <b>order</b> <b>flows</b> from market and limit order submissions, aggregated from tick-by-tick data via volume-based bucketing, as well as various LOB depth and shape metrics. We document a nonlinear relationship between trade imbalance and price change, which however can be converted into a linear link by considering a weighted average of market and limit <b>order</b> <b>flows.</b> We also document a hockey-stick dependence between trade imbalance and one-sided limit <b>order</b> <b>flows,</b> highlighting numerous asymmetric effects between the active and passive sides of the LOB.
