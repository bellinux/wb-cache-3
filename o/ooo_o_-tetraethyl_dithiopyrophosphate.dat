40|$|Section A Polyphase folding and {{metamorphism}} {{of rocks}} in the eastern Mount Isa Inlier resulted from four distinct orogenic cycles. These consist of NE–SW shortening (Ooo) from 1672 to 1648 Ma, involving a succession of five phases of deformation, which {{was responsible for the}} development of first generation NW–SE- striking macroscopic folds, plus cleavages that are mainly only preserved in porphyroblasts. N–S shortening (O 1) followed to 1600 Ma, involving at least three phases of deformation. This period of N–S- directed orogenesis rotated large portions of the NW–SE- trending regional folds into W–E trends and the dominance of locally well-preserved W–E-trending sub-vertical matrix foliations as well as the intensification of foliation parallel to bedding. Subsequent W–E shortening (O 2) from 1600 to 1515 Ma was accompanied by the development of N–S-trending folds. These dominate the Mount Isa Inlier and where best developed involved the formation of at least three near orthogonal foliations. Where these large-scale folds regionally are weakly developed or not visible, only one sub-vertical foliation has developed. Finally NW–SE shortening (O 3) produced locally developed SW–NE-trending folds and weak crenulations until 1500 Ma. The asymmetry of steep to gentle pitch changes in inclusion trails preserved in garnet porphyroblasts that developed during Ooo indicates thrusting to the SW. Similar inclusion trail asymmetries in garnet, staurolite and andalusite porphyroblasts that developed in O 1, indicate thrusting to the N confirming a change in thrust direction across the Wonga Duchess belt to the W. Formation of the Meerenurker roof thrust near Mount Isa by thrusting to the SW during Ooo with subsequent development of the Kokkalukkernurker duplex below by thrusting to the S during O 1 reduces the displacement required for the roof thrust from 234 to 45 kms. Foliations preserved in Ooo garnets are truncated by foliations associated with the development of O 1 in the matrix. O 1 garnet, staurolite and andalusite porphyroblasts preserve inclusion trails that are commonly truncated against a differentiated crenulation cleavage in the matrix that formed during O 2. The inclusion trails entrapped within <b>Ooo</b> and <b>O</b> 1 generated porphyroblasts reveal that the foliations that progressively developed in the matrix during these orogenies were composite fabrics resulting from the effects of multiple discrete orthogonal increments in each case. Numerous phases of sub-vertical foliation development due to horizontal bulk shortening were followed by phases of gently dipping foliation formation due to gravitational collapse that accompanied thrusting during <b>Ooo</b> and <b>O</b> 1. Section B The relative timing of the sequence of events is problematic where deformation partitioning strongly separates zones dominated by folds that formed in different periods of orogeny. This is particularly the case where they form orthogonal to one another in plan view. A succession of foliation inflection/intersection axes preserved within porphyroblasts (FIAs) readily resolves the sequence. The succession of FIAs, as well as foliations in the matrix in the Soldiers Cap Group of the eastern Mount Isa Inlier, reveals W–E-directed bulk horizontal shortening followed N–S bulk horizontal shortening in spite of the apparent regional lack of curvature of the W–E-trending folds around those trending N–S. Furthermore, N–S-and W–E-directed bulk shortening both resulted in at least 2 cycles of sub-vertical and sub-horizontal foliation development that define the W–E-and N–S-trending FIAs. Section C Foliation Inflexion/Intersection Axes preserved in porphyroblasts (FIAs) that grew throughout Isan orogenesis reveal four significant changes in the direction of bulk horizontal shortening between 1670 and 1500 Ma from SW–NE, N–S, W–E to NW–SE. This anticlockwise change in the direction of bulk horizontal shortening implies an anticlockwise shift in relative plate motion with time during the long lasted 1670 – 1500 Ma Isan orogeny. Dating monazite grains amongst the foliations defining three of the four FIAs enabled an age for the periods of relative plate motion that produced these structures to be determined. Averaging the ages from monazite grains defining each FIA set revealed 1649 ± 12 Ma for SW–NE shortening, 1645 ± 7 Ma for N–S shortening, and 1591 ± 10 Ma for that directed W–E. Inclusion trail asymmetries indicating shear senses of top to the SW for NW–SE FIAs and dominantly top to the N for W–E FIAs reflect thrusting towards the SW and N. No evidence for tectonism related to early SW–NE bulk horizontal shortening has previously been detected in the Mount Isa Inlier. Amalgamation of the Broken Hill and possibly the Gawler provinces with the Mount Isa province may have taken place during these periods of NE–SW-and N–S-directed thrusting as the ages of tectonism are similar. The possibility of an AUSWUS linkage as part of Rodinia is increased in that 1670 – 1500 Ma period of tectonism in the Mt Isa province exactly spans the gap between two periods of extended tectonism within the USA. Section D Mesoproterozoic low-P/high-T volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Soldiers Cap Group record a complex polymetamorphic history that accompanied four periods of bulk horizontal shortening directed NE–SW, N–S, W–E and NW–SE during the long-lived Isan Orogeny (1650 – 1500 Ma). Low-P/high-T metamorphism prevailed during NE–SW bulk horizontal shortening. This was followed by medium-P/high-T and high-P/high-T tectonism that accompanied the N–S and the W–E shortening periods, respectively. The sediments of the Soldiers Cap Group were deposited between 1675 – 1650 Ma in a tectonic setting that has the characteristics of an intra-continental rift basin.

AT the National Right to Read Conference (Allen, 1970), it was pointed out that an enriching and stimulating home environment could help children become good readers; that parents, like it or not, have a a-role as educators. One of the recommendations of the conference was that communities plan programs for parents to improve their effectiveness as auxiliary sources to help children in reading. Toward this end, several communities in the United States have initiated parent education programs in reading (Lloyd, 1965; McManus, 1964; Smith, M. B., 1971). The project reported herein was part of a parent education program within a middle class community located in the metropolitan area of Southern California, with a population of over 13 <b>o,</b> <b>ooo</b> (1972). The median family income of this community is $ 11, 845. 00, and more than 16 % of the population 25 years and older have attended college from one to three years, and 73. 6 % are high school graduates (United States Census, 1970). Included in the program was an adult education course entitled, "Developmental Reading for Parents and Teacher Aids," and the publication and distribution of a free parent manual entitled, Reading???A Most Wonderful Gift, written by this investigator. It was because the parents in this community were interested in helping their children improve in reading skills that community pressure was placed on the local school board for an adult education program in the field of reading. When requests were made at board of education meetings, the board members agreed to proceed with such a program. Hence, the district administration and staff began looking for ways to assist the parent to provide opportunities in the home, which would broaden the reading experiences of their children. This investigator's proposal for a manual which would be of immediate benefit to parents was met with approval from the district administration. As an active member in this community, serving on the library board of trustees for three years, and working as a reading teacher in the schools, the investigator was well aware of the need for further parent education in reading.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{number of}} medical {{malpractice}} claims {{has been increasing}} in recent years. However, because of the sensitiveness of information and no malpractice insurance coverage, no objective claims-based data has been released in Taiwan to estimate malpractice risk and its economic burden. In a university hospital of Taiwan, after forming a working group for solving malpractice claims in the past 6 years (2005 - 2010), we have collected 445 cases and examined the clinical, administrative, economic and legal information for these cases. First, after applying the Theory of Planned Behavior as our conceptual framework, we have performed several risk-adjustment models of associated factors on the odds of having legal action. Our main results are {{that the number of}} meetings between doctor and patient (OR= 2. 478, p less than <b>O.</b> <b>OOO</b> 1), along with other factors are significantly associated with the incidence of a malpractice claim developing into a legal action (c-statistics= 0. 838). Second, using the amount of compensation as the outcome variable in all settled claims, we have constructed two-part models to describe the relationship between risk factors and outcome. The two-part models contain a logistic regression model as the first part to predict the frequency of paid claims (4. 2 times more odds of having paid claims with every meeting between doctor and patient, OR= 4. 235, p< 0. 001; c-statistics= 0. 918) and an ordinary linear regression model as the second part to predict the amounts of these payments (every meeting between doctors and patient increasing the payment at 0. 18 million NTD [R-square= 0. 5521]). Our third study estimates nationwide malpractice costs for Taiwan based on our database, given limitations of extrapolating from a single hospital. We find that the estimated annual cost of medical malpractice for all of Taiwan's doctors is NTD 239. 6 million (7. 99 million USD) with a range from NTD 168. 6 million to 404. 3 million (5. 62 million to 13. 4 million USD). Such a low estimate may be caused by low lawsuit costs (42. 7 million NTD, 1. 42 million USD) and lower paid claims ratio for settled claims (21 %). The results of the legal-economic analysis will contribute to forming a rational basis for policy debate for current malpractice reform in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|Session - Purines: Release and MetabolismAdenosine is {{released}} from skeletal muscle during contractions {{and contributes to}} exercise hyperemia, but the mechanism(s) that control the adenosine production and release remain unclear. Adenosine is derived from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) breakdown, {{and the rate of}} ATP breakdown varies, depending on the conditions for the contraction (such as velocity of shortening, muscle length, etc). In this study, we investigate the influence of the rate of ATP breakdown, modified by varying the conditions under which the muscle contracts, on the adenosine output from the perfused rat gracilis muscle in-situ. The muscle was vascularly isolated and perfused at a constant flow rate of 40 - 50 pl/min/g, via a muscular branch of the femoral artery, with Kreb’s bicarbonate buffer (pH 7. 3 - 7. 4), supplemented with dextran and albumin, and equilibrated against 95 % 02 / 5 % COZ. ATP breakdown rate was varied by altering either the length of the muscle during isometric contractions or the weight lifted during isotonic contractions. Samples of venous effluent were collected before (control) and during supramaximal electrical stimulation (2 Hz) of the muscle via electrodes placed directly on its surface. Samples were purified by organic extraction, and their adenosine concentrations were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Under isometric c conditions, muscle contractions increased venous adenosine from 30 + 9 to 1473 f 3 18 nM (n = 12; PC 0. 001 Student’s t-test), but neither resting nor stimulated adenosine output was affected by reducing muscle length to 10 % below 1, (the length giving maximal active tension), although both passive and active tensions were decreased to 50 %. Under isotonic conditions, stimulation increased venous adenosine from 428 + 55 nM to 19 12 + 28 1 nM (n = 12; P < <b>O.</b> <b>OOO</b> 1), but adenosine output was not influenced by the weight lifted by the muscle (either log, equivalent to the passive tension exhibited by the muscle when stretched to 1,, or 5 g). Also, the change in venous adenosine due to muscle contractions (stimulation venous-control venous) was similar for both isotonic and isometric contractions. These data suggest that the rate of ATP breakdown by a contracting muscle may not be a major influence on the output of its vasoactive breakdown product, adenosine...|$|R

Acute malnutrition (AM), characterized by wasting, affects 55 million children under five years of age in developing countries. In Mali, the prevalence of AM exceeds 15 % in some seasons. There is currently no consensus on the most effective dietary treatment strategy for children with moderate AM (MAM). Twelve health centers in rural Mali were randomly assigned to provide children with MAM (defined as mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) 70 % NCHS reference median) 1 of 4 dietary regimens: 1) lipid-based, ready-to-use supplementary food (Supplementary Plumpy, SP); 2) special corn soy blend for MAM (CSB++); 3) locally processed, fortified food (Misola, MI); or 4) locally milled flours (millet and cowpea) plus oil, sugar and micronutrient powder (HFM). 1264 non-edematous children aged 6 - 35 months with MAM were offered ~ 500 kcal/d of assigned diet in addition to their usual food intake for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin (Hb) was measured in 1154 children, and plasma ferritin and transferrin receptor were measured in a subset of 452 children. 1178 children (93. 2 %) completed the study and attendance at weekly/bi-weekly follow-up visits was > 85 % in all groups.

Total cost per treatment based on median time to recovery was $ 2. 20 for SP, $ 1. 43 for CSB++, $ 1. 83 for MI and $ 1. 65 for HFM. Anemia rates remained high (> 81 %) in all groups after treatment. SP generally provided greater improvement in iron status compared to MI while CSB++ and HFM had intermediate effects. SP was more effective than other dietary regimens for the treatment of MAM and improvement of iron status; however, the benefits must be considered in relation to product costs and availability...|$|R
