40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} biosimilar {{medicines}} are becoming available. The {{objective of this}} survey was to assess awareness of and attitudes to biosimilars amongst physicians (medical specialists and General Practitioners (GPs)) and community pharmacists in Ireland. Physicians were invited to complete an online questionnaire during April and May 2016. Community pharmacists received a postal questionnaire in August 2015. Responses from 102 medical specialists, 253 GPs and 125 community pharmacists were analysed. The majority of medical specialists (85 %) and pharmacists (77 %) claimed to be either very familiar or familiar with the term biosimilar, whereas many GPs (60 %) were unable to define or {{had never heard of}} the term. One in five (21 %) healthcare professionals responded that biosimilars were the same as generic medicines. The majority of medical specialists opposed pharmacist-led substitution of biological medicines but some thought it could be appropriate if agreed with the clinician in advance. Medical specialists who prescribe biosimilars (n = 43) were more likely to do so on treatment initiation (67 %), than switch a patient from an <b>originator</b> <b>medicine</b> to a biosimilar (28 %). The findings will aid the design of educational initiatives for healthcare professionals and highlight attitudes of healthcare professionals to biosimilars, so informing regulators, policy makers and industry...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To descriptively {{analyze the}} policy {{environment}} surrounding the Polish generic medicines retail market. METHOD: The policy analysis {{was based on}} an international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting generic for <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> in Poland using IMS Health pharmaceutical intelligence data. RESULTS: Poland has a mature, high-volume, low-value generic medicines market, primarily driven by the establishment of the reference price at the price of the cheapest medicine in combination with pricing regulation and the low level of medicine prices. The practice of discounting in the distribution chain implies that the National Health Fund and patients do not capture the potential savings from a generic medicines market where companies compete on price. This high-volume market has benefited in the past from the limited availability of <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> and a short data exclusivity period, even though there are no incentives for physicians to prescribe generic medicines and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. Increased generic substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> by 21 %. CONCLUSION: To develop a competitive and sustainable market, Poland needs to consider moving away from competition by discount to competition by price. This could be achieved by replacing maximum distribution margins by fixed margins. Also, Poland may wish to raise reference prices as a temporary measure to boost market entry for medicine classes with few generic medicines. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Jordan {{dramatically}} {{strengthened the}} level of intellectual property protection it provides for pharmaceutical products in consequence of joining the World Trade Organization in 2000 and signing a Free Trade Agreement with the United States in 2001. This study assesses the impact of higher levels of intellectual property protection on access to medicines by quantifying the effects on the private retail pharmaceutical market of delayed market entry of generic products. Adjusted for increased sales volume and inflation, from 1999 to 2004 there was a 17 % increase in total annual expenditure for medicines in Jordan. When assessing <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> that were marketed in both 1999 and 2004, and for which there were generic equivalents, the weighted average price of <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> increased while the weighted average price of equivalent generic medicines decreased. Delayed market entry of generics due to enhanced intellectual property protection is estimated to have cost Jordanian private consumers approximately 18 million U. S. dollars in 2004. Jordan should consider amending its current regulatory scheme on data protection and amending the Unfair Competition and Trade Secrets Law of 2000. Jordan should also consider increased spending on public health to offset the adverse impact on consumers of strengthening its intellectual property protection relevant to pharmaceutical products. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to conduct}} a {{descriptive}} analysis of the policy environment surrounding the generic medicines retail market in Portugal. The policy analysis focuses on supply-side measures (i. e. market access, pricing, reference-pricing and reimbursement of generic medicines) and demand-side measures (i. e. incentives for physicians to prescribe, for pharmacists to dispense and for patients to use generic medicines). Methods: The policy analysis {{was based on an}} international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting generic for <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> in Portugal using IMS Health data. Results: Portugal has developed a successful generic medicines market by increasing reimbursement of generic medicines (until October 2005), by introducing a reference-pricing system, by encouraging physicians to prescribe by international non-proprietary name (INN), and by allowing generic substitution by pharmacists. However, the development of the generic medicines market has been hindered by the existence of copies, pricing regulation, certain features of the reference-pricing system, weak incentives for physicians to prescribe generic medicines and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. Increased generic substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> by 45 %. Conclusions: The development of the Portuguese generic medicines market has mainly been fuelled by supply-side measures. To support the further expansion of the market, policy makers need to strengthen demand-side measures inciting physicians to prescribe, pharmacists to dispense and patients to use generic medicines...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Following the {{enactment}} of legislation in June 2013, generic substitution and reference pricing of medicines has been introduced, for the first time, in Ireland. This novel study is the first assessment of the perceptions of community pharmacists in Ireland towards generic medicines completed in the period immediately prior {{to the introduction of}} generic substitution and reference pricing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the perceptions towards generic medicines among community pharmacists. METHODS: One-to-one semistructured interviews were performed with a convenience sample of 44 community pharmacists (from approximately 4, 500 pharmacists in Ireland) recruited from Ireland’s Midwest, South, and Southwest regions. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using NVivo (version 9). RESULTS: 98 % of pharmacists believed that generics were of a similar quality to the originator, and 96 % stated that they were as effective as the originator. However, a small number demonstrated some reticence regarding generics: 9 % believed that generics were not manufactured to the same quality as the originator; 7 % stated they would prefer to take an <b>originator</b> <b>medicine</b> themselves; and 7 % reported having experienced quality issues with generic medicines. 89 % of pharmacists reported receiving patient complaints regarding use of generic medicine, although 64 % suggested that this was due to a nocebo effect (i. e., a result of patients’ preconceived notions that generics were inferior). Only a minority (21 %) reported that they had attempted to educate patients as to the equivalency of generics. Although 80 % were in favor of Ireland’s new legislation promoting the use generic medicines, 46 % expressed concerns regarding its practical implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This key stakeholder group had positive attitudes towards generics and the legislation that promotes their use. Concerns regarding patient perception and experience, clinical effectiveness, and manufacturing quality were identified. We propose that interventions supporting implementation of the new legislation should address these concerns. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent of generic {{competition}} in European countries, given an understanding of these countries' different pharmaceutical price regulations and health care structures. In particular, this study investigates generic competition among the five largest European pharmaceutical markets; the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, with comprehensive IMS data set for 10 years (1994 - 2003), in order to estimate the effect of generic entry on drug prices at the product level. Both within and across these countries, different interventions are being applied to in-patent and off-patent markets during 10 years of the study period. For example, in Germany, markets for on-patent drugs are largely unregulated and prices are set relatively freely; however, once generics enter the market, the German government uses reference pricing to set reimbursement rates. In the UK, <b>originator</b> <b>medicine</b> prices are free from direct regulatory intervention, but are subject to a rate of return regulation. Additionally, once generics enter the market, the UK's government uses price caps. France, Italy, and Spain, on the other hand, use direct price controls for originator drugs and reference pricing system for generic drugs. Accordingly, this analysis finds that generic entry has a negative effect on prices in countries with free pricing originator market, whereas in European Union (EU) countries with strict price and reimbursement regulation, generic competition is ineffective and/or counterproductive. Low regulated prices for originator products do not encourage generic entry following patent expiration. This finding is consistent with less generic firms and less competitive late entrants in regulated environments. Thus, strict price regulation undermines price competition in the off-patent sector, and cost savings from post-patent competition are not realized in countries with strict pricing and reimbursement policies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				Generic {{medicines}} {{are those}} where patent protection has expired, and {{which may be}} produced by manufacturers other than the innovator company.

40|$|This {{observational}} study investigates the private sector, retail pharmaceutical market of 19 low and {{middle income countries}} (LMICs) in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East/South Africa analyzing the relationships between volume market share of generic and <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> over a time series from 2001 to 2011. Over 5000 individual pharmaceutical substances were divided into generic (unbranded generic, branded generic <b>medicines)</b> and <b>originator</b> categories for each country, including the United States as a comparator. In 9 selected LMICs, the market share of those originator substances with the largest decrease over time was compared to the market share of their counterpart generic versions. Generic medicines (branded generic plus unbranded generic) represent between 70 and 80 % of market share {{in the private sector}} of these LMICs which exceeds that of most European countries. Branded generic medicine market share is higher than that of unbranded generics in all three regions and this is in contrast to the U. S. Although switching from an originator to its generic counterpart can save money, this narrative in reality is complex at the level of individual medicines. In some countries, the market behavior of some <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> that showed the most temporal decrease, showed switching to their generic counterpart. In other countries such as in the Middle East/South Africa and Asia, the loss of these originators was not accompanied by any change at all in market share of the equivalent generic version. For those countries with a significant increase in generic medicines market share and/or with evidence of comprehensive "switching" to generic versions, notably in Latin America, it would be worthwhile to establish cause-effect relationships between pharmaceutical policies and uptake of generic medicines. The absence of change in the generic medicines market share in other countries suggests that, at a minimum, generic medicines have not been strongly promoted...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This study aims {{to provide}} a {{landscape}} of the global antiretroviral (ARV) market by analyzing the transactional data on donor-funded ARV procurement between 2003 and 2015, and the ARV price determinants. Design: The data {{were obtained from the}} Global Price Reporting Mechanism (GPRM) managed by the AIDS Medicines and Diagnostics Service of the WHO, and it consists of information that covers approximately 80 % of the total donor-funded adult ARV transactions procurement. Methods: ExWorks prices and procured quantities were standardized according to the guidelines in terms of yearly doses. Descriptive statistics on quantities and prices show the main trends of the ARV market. Ordinary least squares estimation was carried out for the whole sample, then stratified according to the type of supplier (originator and generic) and controlled for time and geographical fixed-effects. Given that analyses were carried out on a public dataset on ARV transactional prices from the GPRM, ethics are respected and consent was not necessary. Results: <b>Originator</b> <b>medicines</b> are on average the least expensive in the sub-Saharan Africa region, where at the same time, generic medicines are on average the most expensive. By contrast, <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> are the most expensive in Europe and Central Asia, and generic medicines are the least expensive. In fact, the data suggest mixed strategies by ARV suppliers to exploit opportunities for profit maximization and to adapt to the specific conditions of market competition in each region. Our results also suggest that the expiration of patents is not sufficient to boost additional developments in generic competition (at least in the ARV market) and that formal or informal agreements between generic firms may de facto slow down or even reverse long-term trends towards price decreases. Conclusions: Our findings provide an improved understanding of the ARV market that can help countries strengthen policy measures to increase their bargaining power in price negotiations and the use of TRIPS flexibilities, with a special emphasis on negotiations with generic manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. This study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of generic medicine competition on the market share growth and pricing of <b>originator</b> brand <b>medicine</b> in the South African private pharmaceutical market. The study is based on five years (2005 to 2011) of IMS Health market share data for 39 originator brand drugs that {{have been exposed to}} competition from generic substitutes from 2001. The results show that, for all the drug molecules included in the study pooled together, the price of an <b>originator</b> brand <b>medicine</b> relative to the weighted average price of its generics has a significant negative impact on the change of its market share. Results for the molecules pooled according to anatomical classes, as well as each molecule separately, show that in four out of the nine classes represented in the study and nine out of the 39 molecules the relative price of the <b>originator</b> brand <b>medicine</b> had a significant negative impact on its change in market share. The manufacturers and marketers of generic medicines would be well advised to offer their medicines at significantly discounted prices compared to the originator brands, as the results suggest that the market penetration of the generic product may depend heavily on the price the generics are offered at. Investigations into the prices of the originator brands in relation with the number of generic equivalents in the market show that the number of generics available in a specific market has a significant positive impact on the relative price of originators, thereby making originators relatively more expensive compared with their generic competitors, {{while at the same time}} the results show that the absolute price of the <b>originator</b> brand <b>medicines</b> declines as the number of generic equivalents in the market increases. This indicates that, from a policy perspective, reducing the barriers to entry for generic <b>medicine</b> once <b>originator</b> patents expire may have a significant role to play in reducing the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in the South African market...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{medicines}} offer equally high-quality {{treatment as}} <b>originator</b> <b>medicines</b> do at much lower prices. As such, {{they represent a}} considerable opportunity for authorities to obtain substantial savings. At the moment, the pharmaceutical landscape is changing and many pharmaceutical companies have altered their development and commercial strategies, combining both originator and generic divisions. In spite of this, the generic medicines industry is currently facing a number of challenges: delayed market access; the limited price differential with originator medicines; the continuous downwards pressure on prices; and the negative perception regarding generic medicines held by some key stakeholder groups. This could jeopardize the long-term sustainability of the generic manufacturing industry. Therefore, governments must focus on demand-side policies, alongside policies to accelerate market access, as the generic medicines industry will {{only be able to}} deliver competitive and sustainable prices if they are ensured a high volume. In the future, the generic medicines industry will increasingly look to biosimilars and generic versions of orphan drugs to expand their business. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|R

40|$|Generic {{drugs have}} a key {{role to play in}} the {{efficient}} allocation of financial resources for pharmaceutical medicines. Policies implemented in the countries with a high rate of generic drug use, such as Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, are reviewed, with consideration of the market structures that facilitate strong competition. Savings in these countries are realized through increases in the volume of generic drugs used and the frequently significant differences in the price between generic <b>medicines</b> and branded <b>originator</b> <b>medicines.</b> Their policy tools include the mix of supply-side measures and demand-side measures that are relevant for generic promotion and higher generic use. On the supply-side, key policy measures include generic drug marketing regulation that facilitates market entry soon after patent expiry, reference pricing, the pricing of branded originator products, and the degree of price competition in pharmaceuticalmarkets. Onthe demand-side, measures typically encompass influencing prescribing and dispensing patterns as well as introducing a co-payment structure for consumers/ patients that takes into consideration the difference in cost between branded and generic medicines. Quality of generic medicines is a pre-condition for all other measures discussed to take effect.

40|$|Background. To {{benefit from}} cost-savings {{associated}} with generic medicine use; in June 2013, Ireland introduced generic substitution and reference pricing. The attitudes and behaviours {{of health care}} professionals may influence successful implementation of such changes. Objectives. To assess perceptions of GPs in Ireland regarding generic medicines in the time {{leading up to the}} enactment of the new legislation {{and for the first time}} in at least the prior decade. Methods. Detailed one-to-one semi-structured interviews performed with a representative cohort of 34 urban- and rural-based GPs in Ireland. Results. Thirty of the participating 34 GPs prescribed generic medicines actively. Predominantly, participants believed that generics worked as effectively, and were of the same quality, as <b>originator</b> <b>medicines.</b> However, 32 GPs reported receiving patient complaints regarding generics; almost a third reported complaints of increased or altered side effects. Thirty-two GPs stated that they would take a generic medicine, although one in seven would choose the originator if offered a choice. A minority of GPs were of the view that generics are manufactured to a poorer quality than originators and may be a risk to patient safety. Conclusion. This study of GPs’ attitudes towards generic medicines in Ireland highlights that this key stakeholder group has generally positive attitudes towards both generic medicines and the new legislation. However, variable knowledge about generic medicines and concerns regarding patient experience, clinical effectiveness and manufacturing quality were identified. GPs’ opinions could negatively influence patient opinions; enhancing such opinions may prove important in successfully implementing the new legislation...|$|R
40|$|Background: South Africa has {{followed}} a pro-generic policy since {{the introduction of}} the National Drug Policy in 1996. The selection processes in {{the public and private sectors}} have, however, remained largely disconnected, and at times contradictory. Medicines provided outside of hospitals accounted for 17 % of medical aid spend in 2006, up 8. 8 % from the previous year. Of particular concern to funders has been the expenditure on the 27 chronic conditions listed as Prescribed Minimum Benefits. The Medical Schemes Act (No 131 of 1998) provides for the definition of Prescribed Minimum Benefits, which stipulate a package of services or care a medical scheme must provide for in its benefit design. There is pressure to reconsider these requirements in order to increase the affordability of medical scheme coverage. This study assessed the potential savings that would be achievable by substituting generics for brand name (<b>originator)</b> <b>medicines</b> listed in the chronic disease algorithms set out by the Council for Medical Schemes (CMS). Methods: All medicines listed in the 25 chronic diseases algorithms made available by the CMS were identified. Brand and generic versions were identified in the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS, May 2006). Single exit prices inclusive of value added tax were obtained from the web site of the Pharmaceutical Blue Book and the cost per defined daily dose for one month was then calculated. Cost differentials, where available, were then identified for each medicine listed in the algorithms. Cost differentials for medicines within each algorithm were presented as the median of the difference between brand and generic medicines listed for that algorithm, and also as the median of differences between generic medicines for the same condition...|$|R

40|$|Background: Generic {{medicines}} {{result from}} expired intellectual property protection {{and the ability}} of pharmaceutical producers, other than originator companies, to manufacture analogous medicines containing identical active ingredients and to distribute them in relevant markets. Cost reductions associated with procurement of generics by national agencies, and subsequent savings for patients buying generic medicines from pharmacies, result in policies regarding generic medicines and reference pricing being promoted by governments internationally. In Ireland, however, generic medicines usage has been poor historically and attitudes of stakeholders, other than the Irish Government, have been relatively negative. In June 2013 the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act was signed into law, meaning that Irish patients are now more likely than ever before to receive a generic medicine. Objectives From 2013, general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists alike are likely to encounter greater patient awareness, and discussion, of generic medicines, their potential benefits and disadvantages. This thesis focused initially on providing a comprehensive description of generic medicines and their development and, at a time immediately preceding introduction of the Irish Act, on gaining insight into current stakeholder attitudes and awareness towards generic medicines in Ireland. In parallel, a novel tool based on principles of understandability and readability of text was developed. This was utilised to assess websites most likely to be accessed by patients seeking information regarding generic medicines across a number of English speaking regions, with emphasis on Ireland. Methods Mixed methods studies (in the format of 1 : 1 interviews) with GPs, pharmacists and patients from rural and urban settings in Ireland. Analysis of interviews was both qualitative and quantitative using SPSS (version 20) and NVivo (version 9), as appropriate. Evaluation of websites was completed with a novel Website Quality Assessment (WQA) tool, developed as part of this thesis. Websites most likely to be used by searchers looking for online information about generic medicines in five Englishspeaking geographical regions (US, UK, Ireland, Canada and Australia) were assessed for quality and accessibility (in terms of readability and understandability) of information provided. Results Analysis of survey data showed that there was a hierarchy of understanding and acceptance of generic medicines in Ireland. In summary, pharmacists had the greatest understanding of generic medicines and the processes associated with their regulation and safety, followed by GPs and then patients. Notably, GPs had less confidence in generics than pharmacists; indeed 5 / 34 (15 %) of GPs would prefer not to use a generic medicine if provided an originator alternative versus 3 / 44 (7 %) of pharmacists. Patients expressed the lowest level of confidence with 9 / 38 (24 %) stating a preference for the branded medication in addition to a belief that generics were of poorer quality than <b>originator</b> <b>medicines.</b> Use of the WQA tool, following peer review and validation of its design, demonstrated clearly that readability and understandability of healthcare information influenced the Google search ranking of generic medicine-related websites. In Ireland, analogous to other jurisdictions, none of the websites most likely to be seen by a searcher demonstrated the desired combination of scoring highly for both quality of information and readability. Conclusions: In summary, these investigations impart new insights regarding knowledge, attitudes and behaviours in Ireland towards generic medicines, determine and evaluate the Internet resources likely to be accessed by those seeking knowledge on this topic across a number of English-speaking regions, and provide a unique tool to enhance the promotion and provision of relevant information...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesIn low- {{and middle-income}} countries, {{patients}} and reimbursement agencies that purchase medicines {{in the private}} sector pay more for originator brands when generic equivalents exist. We estimated the savings that could be obtained from a hypothetical switch in <b>medicine</b> consumption from <b>originator</b> brands to lowest-priced generic equivalents for a selection of medicines in 17 countries. MethodsIn this cost minimization analysis, the prices of originator brands and their lowest-priced generic equivalents were obtained from facility-based surveys conducted by using a standard methodology. Fourteen medicines most commonly included in the surveys, plus three statins, were included in the analysis. For each medicine, the volume of private sector consumption of the originator brand product was obtained from IMS Health, Inc. Volumes were applied to the median unit prices for both originator brands and their lowest-priced generics to estimate cost savings. Prices were adjusted to 2008 by using consumer price index data and were adjusted for purchasing power parity. ResultsFor the medicines studied, an average of 9 % to 89 % could be saved by an individual country from a switch in private sector purchases from originator brands to lowest-priced generics. In public hospitals in China, US $ 370 million could be saved from switching only four medicines, saving an average of 65 %. Across individual medicines, average potential savings ranged from 11 % for beclometasone inhaler to 73 % for ceftriaxone injection. ConclusionsSubstantial savings could be achieved by switching private sector purchases from <b>originator</b> brand <b>medicines</b> to lowest-priced generic equivalents. Strategies to promote generic uptake, such as generic substitution by pharmacists and increasing confidence in generics by professionals and the public, should be included in national medicines policies...|$|R
40|$|Biosimilar {{medicines}} are biological medicines {{that have}} been developed to be highly similar and clinically equivalent to an existing biological medicine. The introduction of these medicines provides additional patient choice and enables financial savings. These savings can be used within the NHS to help support the use of new treatments as they become available and further develop services for patients. The NHS already has a history of using biosimilar medicines for indications such as growth hormone deficiency, neutropenia associated with chemotherapy and anaemia related to renal disease. Biosimilar infliximab is now available for the management of a number of rheumatology conditions and, in the next few years, additional biosimilar medicines will become available for rheumatology patients. The introduction of biosimilars requires careful planning, the expertise of a multidisciplinary team and effective communication. Of utmost importance is the involvement of the patient in the decision to use a biosimilar.

40|$|This {{editorial}} discusses {{a number}} of trends affecting the pricing of generic medicines in Europe. With respect to pricing, recent evidence has emerged that European generic medicine manufacturers face competition from Indian manufacturers; that the price level of generic medicines varies substantially between European countries; and that generic medicine manufacturers engage in competition by discount rather than price competition in France, The Netherlands and the UK. These trends suggest {{that there may be}} scope for further reducing the prices of generic medicines in several countries. In relation to reference pricing, most European countries have incorporated market incentives within reference pricing systems with a view to promoting price competition. The European experience indicates that the generic medicines industry delivers competitive prices under a reference pricing system if demand-side policies are in place that stimulate physicians, pharmacists and patients to use generic medicines. Finally, caution needs to be exercised when focusing on the drivers of generic medicine pricing as these drivers not only vary between countries, but may also vary within a country. Manufacturers of <b>originator</b> and generic <b>medicines</b> do not take a single pricing approach following patent expiry, but vary their pricing strategy from molecule to molecule. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNon-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) {{were previously}} considered to only affect high-income countries. However, they {{now account for}} a very large burden {{in terms of both}} mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), although {{little is known about the}} impact these diseases have on households in these countries. In this paper, we present a literature review on the costs imposed by NCDs on households in LMICs. We examine both the costs of obtaining medical care and the costs associated with being unable to work, while discussing the methodological issues of particular studies. The results suggest that NCDs pose a heavy financial burden on many affected households; poor households are the most financially affected when they seek care. Medicines are usually the largest component of costs and the use of <b>originator</b> brand <b>medicines</b> leads to higher than necessary expenses. In particular, in the treatment of diabetes, insulin [...] when required [...] represents an important source of spending for patients and their families. These financial costs deter many people suffering from NCDs from seeking the care they need. The limited health insurance coverage for NCDs is reflected in the low proportions of patients claiming reimbursement and the low reimbursement rates in existing insurance schemes. The costs associated with lost income-earning opportunities are also significant for many households. Therefore, NCDs impose a substantial financial burden on many households, including the poor in low-income countries. The financial costs of obtaining care also impose insurmountable barriers to access for some people, which illustrates the urgency of improving financial risk protection in health in LMIC settings and ensuring that NCDs are taken into account in these systems. In this paper, we identify areas where further research is needed to have a better view of the costs incurred by households because of NCDs; namely, the extension of the geographical scope, the inclusion of certain diseases hitherto little studied, the introduction of a time dimension, and more comparisons with acute illnesses...|$|R
40|$|Generic {{medicine}} pricing {{is an area}} {{of national}} responsibility of European Union countries. This article aims to present the current status and impact of generic medicine pricing policies in ambulatory care in Europe. The study conducts a literature review of policies relating to free-pricing systems, price-regulated systems, price differentiation, price competition and discounts, and tendering procedures; and a survey of European generic medicine pricing policies. Competition from Indian generic medicine manufacturers, European variation in generic medicine prices and competition between generic medicine manufacturers by discount suggest that the potential savings to health care payers and patients from generic medicines are not fully realized in Europe. One way of attaining these savings may be to move away from competition by discount to competition by price. Free-pricing systems may drive medicine prices downwards under specific conditions. In price-regulated systems, regulation may lower prices of <b>originator</b> and generic <b>medicines,</b> but may also remove incentives for additional price reductions beyond those imposed by regulation. To date, {{little is known about the}} current status and impact of tendering procedures for medicines in ambulatory care. In conclusion, the European experience suggests that there is not a single approach towards developing generic medicine pricing policies in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} medicine prices, {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} <b>medicines</b> (<b>originator</b> brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”). Methods Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines were collected in 56 pharmacies across six cities in Southern Brazil using the World Health Organization / Health Action International methodology. Median prices obtained were divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). Results In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP for originator brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % for originator brands, generics and similar medicines, respectively. In the public sector, mean availability of similar medicines was 2 – 7 times {{higher than that of}} generics. Mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities.

40|$|International audienceBackgroundBiosimilars are {{copies of}} {{biological}} reference medicines. Unlike generics (copies of chemical molecules), biologics are complex, expensive and complicated to produce. The {{knowledge of the}} factors affecting the competition following patent expiry for biologics remains limited. ObjectivesThe aims {{of this study were}} to analyse the EU- 5 Granulocyte-Colon Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) markets and to determine the factors affecting the G-CSF biosimilar uptakes, particularly that of biosimilar prices relative to <b>originators.</b> MethodsData on <b>medicine</b> volumes, values, and ex-manufacturer prices for all G-CSF categories were provided by IMS Health. Volumes were calculated in defined daily doses (DDD) and prices in Euros per DDD. In the EU- 5 countries, there is 5 years of experience with biosimilar G-CSFs (2007 – 2011). ResultsTwo G-CSF market profiles exist: (1) countries with a high retail market distribution, which are the largest G-CSF markets with low global G-CSF biosimilar uptakes (5. 4 % in France and 8. 5 % in Germany in 2011); and (2) countries with a dominant hospital channel, which are the smallest markets with higher G-CSF biosimilar uptakes (12. 4 % in Spain and 20. 4 % in the UK). The more the decisions are decentralized, the more their uptakes are high. The price difference between G-CSF biosimilars and their reference plays a marginal role at a global level (price differences of + 13. 3 % in the UK and − 20. 4 % in France). ConclusionThe competition with G-CSF biosimilars varies significantly between EU- 5 countries, probably because of G-CSF distribution channel differences. Currently, this competition is not mainly based on prices, but on local political options to stimulate tendering between them and recently branded second- or third-generation products...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{medicine}} prices, their {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines on the market (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”), using an established methodology. Data on prices and availability of 50 <b>medicines</b> (<b>originator</b> brand, lowestpriced generic and similar medicines) were collected from public, private and popular pharmacies (N= 56) across six cities in Southern Brazil. Median prices obtained are divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP for originator brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % for originator brands, generics and similars, respectively. The number of working days needed {{to pay for a}} complete medicine treatment (affordability) varied considerably between medicines aimed at treating acute and chronic diseases and by type of medicine. In the public sector, the mean availability of similar medicines was 2 - 7 times higher than that of generics. The mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities. This analysis finds that availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge for supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. Policies targeted to reduce the prices of the generics need to be implemented in Brazil, as well as making them more widely available. Popular pharmacies may help overcome the lack of medicines in the public sector, but the limited number of medicines distributed in these facilities is of concern...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: While it is {{generally}} understood that large sections {{of the population in}} low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack access to medicines, the concept of access is difficult to define and measure. Data on medicine prices and availability obtained through national facility-based surveys were examined through a variety of approaches to determine their usefulness in informing a global understanding of access to medicines. Methods: National and sub-national data on medicine price and availability were obtained from a database containing results of surveys conducted using a standard methodology (developed through a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI)). In the surveys, the prices and availability of approximately 50 medicines are collected in a sample of facilities in the public and private sectors. Data are also collected on public procurement prices as well as the add-on costs applied through the supply and distribution chain. WHO/HAI data for 15 commonly-surveyed medicines were aggregated on a global level, taking several steps to improve the comparability of results. Similar analyses were also conducted for individual disease areas, namely cardiovascular disease and epilepsy. The availability of medicines used for acute and chronic conditions, respectively, were then compared. To further explore treatment affordability, medicine price data was used to quantify the impoverishment effects of medicine purchases in a subset of 17 countries. Finally, medicine prices were used in combination with consumption data to estimate potential savings which could arise from switching consumption from originator brands to generics. Findings: The secondary analysis of survey results for commonly-available medicines showed that medicine availability {{is generally}} low: 38. 4 % and 64. 2 % in the public and private sectors, respectively. Analyses for individual disease areas showed similar results: availability of generics medicines was only 26. 3 % for cardiovascular medicines and < 50 % for nearly all antiepileptics. When the availability of medicines for acute and chronic conditions was compared, it was found that medicines for chronic conditions were substantially less available than those for acute conditions (36. 0 % availability versus 53. 5 % in the public sector). Overall, private sector patient prices ranged from 9 - 25 times international reference prices for lowest-priced generic medicines. This was found to translate into poor affordability: for example, purchasing a month’s supply of the antidiabetic glibenclamide in generic form would push an additional 6 % of populations below the international poverty line (US $ 1. 25 /day). <b>Originator</b> brand <b>medicines</b> were found to be consistently less affordable than their lowest-priced generic equivalents, which was illustrated in an analysis which showed that approximately 60 % of private sector spending on medicines could be achieved by switching consumption from originators to lowest-priced generics. Conclusions: These analyses show that national-level data on medicine price and availability can be used to improve our understanding of access to medicines in low- and middle-income countries. While results vary across countries, global and regional trends raise concerns regarding access to medicines in these contexts. Given their role in informing advocacy efforts, investments, and policy and programmatic support related to access to medicines, ongoing efforts are needed to collect and report on medicine prices and availability...|$|R
40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHBackground: South African medical scheme members needlessly {{purchase}} {{high cost}} <b>originator</b> prescription <b>medicines</b> which attract {{out of pocket}} co-payments at pharmacies. This is despite availability of low priced generic medicines that are paid for in full by medical schemes. Co-payments result from misalignment between prices of the dispensed medicine {{and that of the}} alternative medicine which appears on the medical scheme's formulary list and for which the scheme is prepared to pay for in full. To establish what factors caused such misalignment, perspectives of medical scheme members and key informants which included pharmacists, regulators and representatives of medical schemes were explored. The study focused on co-payments for prescription medicines dispensed at private sector retail pharmacies in Pretoria, South Africa. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} explore views about co-payments and identify factors that motivate and influence Pretoria medical scheme members to co-pay when purchasing prescription medicines at pharmacies, despite being insured by medical scheme insurance organizations. Methodology: An exploratory qualitative research study was performed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among purposefully selected medical scheme members (12) and 9 key informants. Key informants consisted of dispensing pharmacists (6), regulators of health professionals and medical schemes (2) and a senior official (1) with experience in the regulation of medicines and operations within medical scheme organizations. From a total of twelve interviewed medical scheme members, eight were interviewed at preselected retail pharmacies after they had made a co-payment and the other four selected because they did not make a co-payment. To ensure diversity in views about co-payments and related factors, dispensing pharmacists, co-paying and non co-paying medical scheme members were accessed from six pharmacies that are located in two separate locations of different socioeconomic status in Pretoria, that is, the Pretoria East suburban area and Pretoria city centre which is close to Pretoria central station and taxi routes. Three pharmacies were identified from each of the two different geographical locations, one independent and two corporate pharmacies per socioeconomic area. One pharmacist was interviewed from each of the selected pharmacies and medical scheme members were accessed from across the six pharmacies. The remainder of the key informants such as the regulators, were interviewed during office hours at venues of their choice which included areas of work. A pilot study was conducted among medical scheme members and pharmacists to test the applicability of interview tools. All interviews were conducted face-to-face by the researcher and recorded. The electronic record was independently compared with the researcher's enhanced notes for data accuracy. Codes identified during data analysis were derived from the interview notes and recordings and translated into organized text for theme development in a manner that referenced them to each study objective. Themes were arrived at after combining similar codes which were noted as representing a particular description for use during data interpretation and report writing. Ethics: Ethical clearance was sought from the UWC Senate Research Committee and granted. Prior to conducting interviews, written consent was obtained from all participants. Research details were explained and also provided on the participant information sheet wherein voluntary participation was emphasized. Anonymity and confidentiality was maintained throughout. Results: All patients and pharmacists expressed confusion about the medical scheme rules and related co-payments. There were differing co-payment perspectives among scheme members depending on socioeconomic status, with affordability being a key factor among those of lower socio-economic status whilst convenience and lack of comprehensible information about co-payments was prioritised amongst those members of higher socioeconomic status. Key influences on patient's purchasing decisions were health professionals (both doctors and pharmacists), with friends, family members and advertisements less influential. Patients and medical schemes generally preferred to utilise large chain pharmacies and patients, in particular, had a poor perception of the quality of generics. In general, the first prescribed medicine was highly favoured by patients and this influenced medicine preferences during subsequent prescriptions, especially for non communicable disease (NCD) medicines. Pharmacists did not apply the generic substitution policy in a manner that benefited the consumer because the lowest priced generic was frequently not kept as pharmacy stock. Co-payments appeared to create a divide between corporate and independent pharmacies. Some regulators tended to blame patients, pharmacists and medical schemes rather than the lack of adequate enforcement of national policies and regulations. Inadequate monitoring and enforcement of pro-consumer policies were found to be the main factors that contributed to co-payments. Conclusions and Recommendations: The introduction of regulations on minimum requirements for stock available at private sector retail pharmacies should be considered to ensure availability of the lowest priced generic at all times. This would ensure that co-payments are reduced and the desired consumer benefits that should accrue from the existing generic substitution policy are realized and maximized. To prevent perception-based and self-initiated co-payment behavior among consumers, vigorous and continued education about the value and equivalence of generics should be championed at the highest level of government with the execution of this critical responsibility not left to those with profit driven motives. Consumers might benefit from extensive education about the purchasing choices made at pharmacies and, in particular, the negative financial consequences associated with choosing a preferred but highly priced originator versus a low cost generic medicine which is used to treat the same ailment. Enforcement of policies by dedicated government agencies could further protect consumers from preventable high cost of healthcare and of medicines in particular...|$|R
