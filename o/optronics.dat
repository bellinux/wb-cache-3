25|$|In 1869, in the {{municipal}} area alone, 100 ore mines were in operation. Wetzlar's first blast furnace, {{built by the}} brothers Buderus, went into service in 1872. As well, world-famous optical and precision mechanics companies such as Leitz (Leica), Hensoldt (Zeiss <b>Optronics</b> in the past, now Airbus), Pfeiffer Vacuum, Philips, Loh, Seibert, Hollmann, Minox and many others {{set up shop in}} the town.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Thales <b>Optronics</b> won the {{contract}} for the Battle Group Thermal Imaging (BGTI) programme. The contract will replace the image intensification sights installed on British Army Scimitar and Royal Engineers Spartan vehicles. They were replaced by a new gunner's sight with a day thermal image and laser rangefinder sight. The vehicle commander will have a monitor and a map display and the driver a navigation capability.|$|E
25|$|The Passive Infra-Red Airborne Track Equipment (PIRATE) {{system is}} an {{infrared}} search and track (IRST) system {{mounted on the}} port side of the fuselage, forward of the windscreen. Selex ES is the lead contractor which, along with Thales <b>Optronics</b> (system technical authority) and Tecnobit of Spain, make up the EUROFIRST consortium responsible for the system's design and development. Eurofighters starting with Tranche 1 block 5 have the PIRATE. The first Eurofighter Typhoon with PIRATE-IRST was delivered to the Italian Aeronautica Militare in August 2007. More advanced targeting capabilities can be provided {{with the addition of a}} targeting pod such as the LITENING pod.|$|E
25|$|Govan is a {{district}} and former burgh in the south-western {{part of the}} city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite Partick. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and shipbuilding centre of international repute and is {{home to one of}} two BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards on the River Clyde and the precision engineering firm, Thales <b>Optronics.</b> It is also home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the Glasgow Subway system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of Ibrox, Kinning Park and Cessnock.|$|E
25|$|Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) will {{measure the}} {{mid-infrared}} wavelength range from 5 to 27 micrometers. It contains both a mid-infrared camera and an imaging spectrometer. MIRI was {{developed as a}} collaboration between NASA and a consortium of European countries, and is led by George Rieke (University of Arizona) and Gillian Wright (UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Edinburgh, part of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)). MIRI features similar wheel mechanisms as NIRSpec which are also developed and built by Carl Zeiss <b>Optronics</b> GmbH under contract from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg. The completed Optical Bench Assembly of MIRI was delivered to Goddard in mid-2012 for eventual integration into the ISIM. The temperature of the MIRI must not exceed 6 Kelvin (K): a helium gas mechanical cooler sited on the warm side of the environmental shield provides this cooling.|$|E
25|$|Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) {{will also}} perform {{spectroscopy}} {{over the same}} wavelength range. It was built by the European Space Agency at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands. The leading development team is composed of people from Airbus Defence and Space, Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, and the Goddard Space Flight Center; with Pierre Ferruit (École normale supérieure de Lyon) as NIRSpec project scientist. The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution mode using a prism, an R~1000 multi-object mode and an R~2700 integral field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Switching of the modes is done by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism called the Filter Wheel Assembly, and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating Wheel Assembly mechanism. Both mechanisms {{are based on the}} successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the Infrared Space Observatory. The multi-object mode relies on a complex micro-shutter mechanism to allow for simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects anywhere in NIRSpec's field of view. The mechanisms and their optical elements were designed, integrated and tested by Carl Zeiss <b>Optronics</b> GmbH of Oberkochen, Germany, under contract from Astrium.|$|E

[...] The IR-17 system is usually installed on the forward mast just below the 3-D air search radar, and it consists of three parts: sensor head, operator console and electronic cabinet that contains other electronics including power supply.

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the first park, the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP), {{consisting}} of the Tainan Science Park and the Kaohsiung Science Park, was established in 1996. In addition to companies, several research institutes (including Academia Sinica) and universities have set up branches within the park with a focus on integrated circuits (ICs), optoelectronics, and biotechnology. [...] The Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) was established more recently in 2003. While the CTSP is still under development, many firms (including AU <b>Optronics)</b> have already moved into the park and begun manufacturing operations. Like the other parks, CTSP also focuses on ICs, optoelectronics, and biotechnology, with the optoelectronics industry accounting for 78% of its revenue in 2008. These three science parks alone have attracted over NT$4 trillion (US$137 billion) worth of capital inflow, and in 2010 total revenue within the parks reached NT$2.16 trillion (US$72.8 billion).|$|E
2500|$|The OFC (Optical Fire Control) -3 {{electro-optical}} {{fire control}} {{system is a}} modular design that consists of a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can {{be replaced by a}} laser designator (for the laser beam riding SAM), the TV camera can be replaced by a night vision camera, and the IR camera can be replaced by an ImIR, at higher cost. Development to incorporate the dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera has been successfully completed, but it is unclear if these newly developed versions will be [...] installed on any of the ships. [...] The OFC-3 <b>optronics</b> is designed by the Central China Optronic (electro-optical) Research Institute. [...] Although the advanced versions have been [...] successfully tested, only the most basic version have been installed on board Type 052C class, as acknowledged by the developer, and domestic Chinese media rumored the main reason was to reduce the cost. [...] However, the adaptation of the most basic version of OFC-3 results in great decrease in the performance and effectiveness of the main gun, because without the laser designator needed, laser beam riding and semi-active laser guided projectiles can not be deployed for the Type 210 100 mm naval gun.|$|E
