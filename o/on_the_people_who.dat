5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there was}} little {{pressure}} they could bring to bear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could ultimately make changes, longtime team owners Wellington Mara and his nephew Tim, who inherited his father Jack's stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other {{that at one point}} a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players (Craig Morton and Fran Tarkenton) and coaches (Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi) who had once been in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere. The team also had passed over future stars for less able players in the annual draft.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Henry {{questioned}} {{the authority of}} the Philadelphia Convention to presume to speak for “We, the people” instead of “We, the states”. In his view, delegates should have only recommended amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Consolidated government would put an end to Virginia’s liberties and state government. Nine states making a new nation without the rest would abrogate treaties and place Virginia in great peril. Edmund Randolph had changed from his opposition in the Philadelphia Convention to now supporting adoption for the sake of preserving the Union. He noted that the Confederation was “totally inadequate” and leading to American downfall. The new Constitution would repair the inadequacies of the Articles. If something were not done, the Union would be lost. The new government should be based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would be governed by it, not the intermediary states. The Constitution should be ratified, along with any “practical” amendments, after the new nation was begun.|$|E

25|$|The Greek {{government}} responded accepting {{only the}} first three and the last demands. Consequently, using this as a pretext, the Italian Army suddenly attacked Corfu on 31 August 1923. Commander Antony Foschini asked the prefect of Corfu to surrender the island. The prefect refused and he informed the government. Foschini warned him that the Italian forces would attack at 17:00 and the Corfiots refused to raise the white flag in the fortress. Seven thousand refugees, 300 orphans plus the military hospital were lodged in the Old Fortress, {{as well as the}} School of Police in the New Fortress. At 17:05 the Italians bombarded Corfu for 20 minutes. There were victims among the refugees of the old Fortress and the Prefect ordered the raising of the white flag. The Italians besieged the island and set the forces ashore. From the beginning of their possession, they started to inflict hard penalties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had guns, and the officers declared that their possession was permanent. There were daily requisitions of houses and they censored the newspapers. Greece asked for the intervention of the League of Nations, of which both Greece and Italy were members, and demanded the solution of the problem through arbitration. The Italian government of Benito Mussolini refused, declaring that Corfu would remain occupied until the acceptance of the Italian terms. On 7 September 1923, the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris ended with the evacuation of the Italian forces from Corfu, which finally began on 20 September 1923 and ended on the 27th of the same month.|$|E

Upon his return to Brașov on Christmas day, Corvinus took revenge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had rebelled against him by torturing them to death; thereafter he fined the Transylvanians a sum of 400,000 florins, which they had to pay immediately, in gold. With this money he raised an army of foreign mercenaries, which would prove more loyal to him. In 1468, Stephen campaigned in Transylvania, found Aron and had him executed. Stephen and Corvinus would later negotiate a peace treaty and become allies; in 1475, Corvinus sent 1,800 soldiers that assisted Stephen in his victory at the Battle of Vaslui.|$|E

500|$|Three novels were {{published}} on October 1, 2002: one by Aspect and two by Little, Brown Young Readers. The Aspect novel (Smallville: Strange Visitors) {{was written by}} Roger Stern, with Clark and his friends trying to uncover the truth about two religious con men who {{set up shop in}} Smallville and use kryptonite in their spiritual seminars to rob the townspeople. Little, Brown Young Readers first published Arrival by Michael Teitelbaum, chronicling the series' pilot. The second novel (See No Evil, by series writers Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld) follows Dawn Mills, a young actress who wants to attend Juilliard. Dawn, who can become invisible, wants to get revenge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have been talking behind her back but is stopped by Clark.

50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1st {{millennium}} AD, {{the formation}} of states began across central Chad in the sahelian zone between the desert and the savanna. For almost the next 1,000 years, these states, their relations with each other, and their effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> lived in stateless societies along their peripheries dominated Chad's political history. Recent research suggests that indigenous Africans founded most of these states, not migrating Arabic-speaking groups, as was believed previously. Nonetheless, immigrants, Arabic-speaking or otherwise, played a significant role, along with Islam, in the formation and early evolution of these states.|$|R

Barker stated in an interview with Wera Reusch that [...] "The trilogy is trying to tell something about the parts of war that don't get into the official accounts". She goes on to state that [...] "One of the things that impresses me is that two things happen to soldiers in war: a) they get killed or b) they come back more or less alright.

60|$|As I look out, {{the first}} thing I see is the great gilt eagle on the City-Hall dome.

When it rains he never shakes his feathers; snow beats on him without disturbing his stately repose; and he never puts his head under his wing at night, but keeps guard in darkness as in day, like a faithful sentinel. I like the big, lonely bird, call him my particular fowl, and often wish he'd turn his head and speak to me.

They remembered then that they could have bought for a song canvases which now were worth large sums, and they could not forgive themselves for the opportunity which had escaped them. There was a Jewish trader called Cohen, who had come by one of Strickland's pictures in a singular way. He was a little old Frenchman, with soft kind eyes and a pleasant smile, half trader and half seaman, who owned a cutter in which he wandered boldly among the Paumotus and the Marquesas, taking out trade goods and bringing back copra, shell, and pearls. I went to see him because I was told he had a large black pearl which he was willing to sell cheaply, and when I discovered that it was beyond my means I began to talk to him about Strickland.

Along with Fiona Marshall, she studies when animals were domesticated and why there seems to be a lag in the appearance of domesticated animals in eastern Africa.

These animals were also helpful in maintaining the savanna's grasslands with their constant grazing and the pastoralists' burning of the grasslands.|$|R
