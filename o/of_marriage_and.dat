5|$|Artificial {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice of artificial contraception in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal encyclical Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> marital relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.|$|E
5|$|While {{more recent}} critics have {{emphasized}} the revolutionary aspects of the cross-class friendship between Jemima and Maria, others have questioned the extent of that radicalism, arguing that Jemima's story occupies a small section of the novel and is abruptly truncated.

5|$|A {{year later}} {{she arrived in}} Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly. The school {{provided}} its female pupils with classes in chemistry and bookkeeping, in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery. Her roommate was Noémie, the daughter of Henri Rochefort, who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for his support of the Paris Commune. The girls shared tales of their parents' political exploits, and remained good friends for years. Pankhurst was so fond of Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder. Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French husband for her English friend. When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter, the man withdrew his offer <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> Pankhurst returned, miserable, to Manchester.|$|E

5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|Hensley met Inez Hutcheson, a widow {{with ten}} children, in 1946 while {{performing}} a service in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee.

Although he had hoped that she would travel with him and read Bible passages during his services, she left him after {{less than a year}} <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> <b>and</b> their union was soon dissolved. In 1951, Hensley married Sally Norman in Chattanooga. After their marriage, she traveled with him as he ministered in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E

His second wedding, to Rosamunde Marcelle Walker, occurred at St Stephen's on 20 April 1935, though the marriage was to end in divorce in the 1940s.

5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> <b>and,</b> like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E

5|$|Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a {{young girl}} she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, instead of her father's name. She grew up in rural Nevada and {{attended}} the University of Nevada in Reno and the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During her years in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers outside <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> <b>and</b> during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) these included playwright Eugene O'Neill and painter Andrew Dasburg.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> <b>and</b> physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|Through {{fortunes}} <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> inheritance, Warwick {{emerged in}} the 1450s at the centre of English politics. Originally he was a supporter of King Henry VI; however, a territorial dispute with the Duke of Somerset led him to collaborate with Richard, Duke of York, in opposing the king. From this conflict he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais, a position that benefited him greatly {{in the years to}} come. The political conflict later turned into full-scale rebellion, where in battle York was slain, as was Warwick's father Salisbury. York's son, however, later triumphed with Warwick's assistance, and was crowned King Edward IV. Edward initially ruled with Warwick's support, but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king's choice of Elizabeth Woodville as his wife. After a failed plot to crown Edward's brother, George, Duke of Clarence, Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne. The triumph was short-lived however: on 14April 1471 Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet, and killed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{knowledge}} contributions {{of previous studies}} in the area <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> <b>and</b> family life.

The review was done chronologically based on empirical <b>and</b> critical reviews <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> patterns <b>and</b> family life. The review of empirical studies <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> patterns <b>and</b> family life studies was done in two aspects: studies in Sri Lankan context and foreign context. According to the review it seemed that there is a research gap in the area <b>of</b> studying <b>marriage</b> patterns <b>and</b> their effects on family life satisfaction. In Sri Lankan context no any study could be found, on <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> its effects on family life satisfaction. Because of this rationale, the review considered marriage as a major study phenomenon, which has a significant influence on the family life satisfaction and endeavored to provide a base for an empirical study on <b>marriage</b> <b>and</b> family life satisfaction in Sri Lankan context...|$|R
