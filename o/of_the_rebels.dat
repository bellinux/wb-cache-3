5|$|By noon, {{the rebels}} of the 108th Infantry Regiment were {{approaching}} Bjelovar, {{where they were}} joined by elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. The leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in Bjelovar was Kapetan Ivan Mrak, a reserve aviator. When Nedeljković became aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised this would not be possible, as local conscripts would not report for duty. Headquarters of the 4th Army reported the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> to Headquarters 1st Army Group, and it was suggested that the VVKJ could bomb the rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at Rovine was even warned to receive orders to use its Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers to bomb the 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was subsequently abandoned. Instead, it was decided to request that the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček intervene with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster {{negotiated}} a truce with Harclay, and withdrew to the town. During the night {{a great number}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> deserted, {{and the next day}} the sheriff of York arrived from the south with additional forces. Lancaster, now greatly outnumbered and with no chance of retreat, {{had no choice but to}} surrender to Harclay.|$|E
5|$|By noon, {{the rebels}} of the 108th Infantry Regiment were {{approaching}} Bjelovar, and {{were joined by}} elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the division. The leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in Bjelovar was Kapetan Ivan Mrak, a reserve aviator. When 4th Army commander Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković {{became aware of the}} rebels' approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised this would not be possible, as local gendarmerie conscripts would not report for duty. His headquarters reported the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> to the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, suggesting that the Royal Yugoslav Air Force could bomb the rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at Rovine was even warned to receive orders to use its Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers to bomb the 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was subsequently abandoned.

5|$|<b>The</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle changed <b>the</b> {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> {{movement in}} Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> forces would scatter {{as soon as}} they were confronted by federal troops. <b>The</b> fall <b>of</b> Juárez proved that notion wrong and revealed <b>the</b> real strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> forces.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Battle <b>of</b> Bin Jawad marked <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>rebel</b> offensive. Proving to be <b>the</b> {{high-water mark}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> offensive, it marked <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebel</b> advance westward at the time, {{and opened the}} way for a {{government}} counter-offensive that took pro-Gaddafi forces as far as <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Benghazi, before being pushed back by UN intervention.|$|R
5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. Despite {{the fact that the}} revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in laying sieges would allow him to hold out.|$|E
5|$|Following the Hungarian Uprising in November 1956 {{relations}} between Albania and the Soviet Union improved somewhat due to Yugoslavia's {{part in the}} event, which caused friction in Yugoslav-Soviet relations. On November 7 Hoxha wrote an article for Pravda denouncing Tito for encouraging the activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels,</b> though the Soviets rebuked Hoxha for his harsh tone soon after. Soviet efforts to improve relations with Yugoslavia resumed before long, prompting a further deterioration in Soviet–Albanian relations.|$|E
5|$|Guðrøðr Magnússon (fl. 1275), {{also known}} as Godred Magnusson, was an illegitimate son of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles. In 1275, whilst Mann was under Scottish overlordship, Guðrøðr led an {{unsuccessful}} revolt on the island. According to a near contemporary source, over five hundred people {{lost their lives in}} the subsequent Scottish invasion and suppression of the Manx. It is not certain whether Guðrøðr escaped the decisive defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> at Battle of Ronaldsway with his life or if he was among the slain.|$|E

5|$|Hearing of the {{approach}} of Pompey, Spartacus attempted to negotiate with Crassus to bring the conflict to a close before Roman reinforcements arrived. When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces broke out of confinement and fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern Strongoli) in Bruttium, with Crassus' legions in pursuit. The legions managed to catch a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> – {{under the command of}} Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.|$|E
5|$|Qasim al-Ahmad, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in Jabal Nablus, then {{requested}} a pardon from Ibrahim Pasha {{so that he}} could negotiate an end to the fighting himself. Ibrahim agreed and with guarantees of safety by al-Husayni and Abd al-Hadi, Qasim met with Ibrahim in late June. The latter admonished Qasim for his betrayal of Muhammad Ali, to which Qasim responded with an apology and an explanation that his hand was forced. By the end of the meeting, the two reconciled and Ibrahim reappointed Qasim as mutassalim of both Nablus and Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E

5|$|The Kentish {{advance on}} London {{appears to have}} been coordinated with the {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Their forces were armed with weapons including sticks, battle axes, old swords and bows. Along their way, they encountered Lady Joan, the King's mother, who was travelling back to the capital to avoid being caught up in the revolt; she was mocked but otherwise left unharmed. The Kentish rebels reached Blackheath, just south-east of the capital, on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|The Senate, {{alarmed by}} the size of the revolt and the defeat of the praetorian armies of Glaber and Varinius, {{dispatched}} a pair of consular legions under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. Initially, the consular armies were successful. Gellius engaged a group of about 30,000 slaves, under the command of Crixus, near Mount Garganus and killed two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels,</b> including Crixus himself.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{began to}} cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the {{afternoon}} of 13 June. The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in sympathy for the rebel cause or out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city. At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate {{on the north side of}} the city. The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> in.|$|E

5|$|The rebels had {{previously}} been completely disinherited, and their land taken into the king's hands. The Dictum instead extended a pardon, and restored land to their previous owners, contingent on payment of certain penalties that were proportional {{to the level of}} involvement in the rebellion. It was traditional to value land at ten times its annual yield, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> were subsequently fined at half of this amount: five times the annual yield of their lands.|$|E
5|$|The second {{agreement}} was again {{regarded as a}} provisional compromise by both parties. The charter prescribed that a joint delegation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> and the noblemen {{should be sent to}} the king, who was staying in Prague, to seek his arbitration. There is no evidence of the appointment of the delegates or their departure for Prague. Sigismund of Luxemburg died on 9 December 1437.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig {{was one of}} the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and {{was given}} {{authority}} over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> from joining the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised in a work on his life that was later incorporated in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the revolt, Hananu {{effectively}} created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels</b> and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters.|$|E
5|$|Even with Lancaster defeated, {{the battle}} against the rebels was not over. Edmund was charged with {{overtaking}} Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The greater part of the spoils of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited greatly from the forfeiture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rebels.</b> By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund's annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).|$|E
