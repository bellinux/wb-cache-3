50|$|In the Central and Eastern {{parts of}} Ukraine, {{embroidery}} usually consists of geometric forms and plant ornaments. The color {{range of the}} motifs is very delicate and very diverse as to individual details. In the Poltava Region, the colors usually include pale blue, white, light ochre, pale green and gray tones. Poltava products are especially famed for their “white-on-white” and <b>openwork</b> <b>embroidery.</b> The red, red-blue (or red-black) color scheme {{plays an important role}} in Central- and Eastern-Ukrainian embroidery, as it did throughout almost the whole of Ukraine.|$|E
