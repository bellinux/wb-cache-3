To validate the concept, a broadband 3 D coordinate transformation metamaterial lens fed by a simple monopole antenna was designed, fabricated and characterized, achieving a quad-beam radiation pattern over a 1. 26 : 1 bandwidth with approximately 6 dB realized gain improvement in the H-plane. In addition, the near-field coupling between the monopole and the lens was carefully tuned to accomplish a remarkable 70 % broadening of the impedance bandwidth compared to the monopole antenna operating alone.

The presence of nearly a isotropic negative refractive index leads to focusing of omnidirectional sources by a PC slab lens, which can surpass certain limitations of conventional (positive refractive) lenses.

A specific case where such accurate and computationally simple solutions are needed is the acoustical modeling of open or closed volumes. It is possible to model 3 -D propagation of waves in enclosures such as rooms using DWM models. Generally, idealized omnidirectional sources are used for obtaining the im-pulse response in the DWM. However, real-life sound sources are never completely isotropic, causing wavefronts with directional properties. This paper presents two methods to simulate analytical and empirical directivities in 3 -D DWM models in the far-field. The first method {{is based on the}} direct excitation of the mesh with the velocity component of the directional source and is used to simulate analytical sources. The second method is based on the weighting of velocity components generated by an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>source</b> at different octave-bands and is used to simulate sources with frequency-dependent empirical directivity functions.

40|$|Room {{reverberation}} and interfering acoustical noise {{lower the}} quality of speech transmission in teleconferencing. Conventional solutions for speech capture that suppress pickup of reverberation and interference typically constrain {{the motion of the}} speaker, encumber the speaker physically, or make it difficult for many different speakers to easily participate. These impediments result from cables, radio and headset microphones, or so-called house microphones located at fixed positions. Microphone arrays and matched-filter processing have been proposed as solutions to this sound capture problem. In part because the behavior of arrays in reverberant acoustic spaces has not been well quantified, there have been no guidelines for designing effective teleconference arrays. The principal goal of this work is the development of general design rules for speech acquisition arrays. ^ Expressions for the array performance measures of signal-to-reverberation ratio and signal-to-interference ratio are derived using statistical acoustics, then verified by computer simulation using the image method of geometric room acoustics. The analysis is facilitated by assuming the reverberant sound field to be diffuse. The assumption is valid above approximately 250 Hz. All work assumes <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>sources</b> and sensors mounted on walls with low absorption. Array sensors should be placed close to, and roughly equidistant to the source, yet as far from each other as possible. The aperture of a full-band array should extend into three dimensions. Wall and ceiling mounting of sensors is recommended. Relations specify the number of sensors required for various room volumes, room absorptions, and source-to-sensor distances. A planar ceiling array expands the range of motion for speakers by widening the focal region above 300 Hz. Off-line audition of a 32 -sensor array in a 60 -cubicmeter room with a reverberation time of. 63 second indicates that subjectively good array performance may be obtained using processing with matched filters truncated at 30 milliseconds. A listening test using audio from eight virtual arrays operating in a simulated room provides indications of their subjective performance relative to a single microphone operating at four different distances. An array with 32 wall-mounted sensors was constructed in an conference room. Off-line output of the array confirms the general principles of the design theory. ...|$|R
40|$|A compact low-frequency {{projector}} is {{of crucial}} importance especially in underwater acoustics {{due to the}} frequency dependence of the absorption. To improve the efficiency of an <b>omnidirectional</b> acoustic <b>source</b> at low frequencies, parametric amplification may be used by adding {{a thin layer of}} nonlinear medium around a spherical transducer. The parametric effect is based on the interaction of two acoustic waves propagating through a nonlinear medium to produce a difference frequency wave.

Investigation is required to find the optimal medium, that is to say, one with a large nonlinear coefficient and a low sound speed. Such a source has already been built using a medium composed of a gel and microsphere mixture.
