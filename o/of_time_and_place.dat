The works of ancient Greek and Roman physicians Hippocrates, Galen and Dioscorides also had a lasting impact on Islamic medicine.

25|$|Picasso was {{resolved}} {{to undo the}} continuities of form and field which Western art had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right {{turned out to be}} merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of representational art - the feigned unities <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>place,</b> the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The Demoiselles confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. In this one work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the beholder, instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{the second half of the}} colonial period, 1895 to 1945, is highly remarked as {{political}} stability and economic growth which accelerated modernization in Taiwan. The competition between the Japanese colonial Government-General and the native Taiwanese elite in the course of its modernization draw many young Taiwanese dream of being artists in a way of provoking improvement of their social status or cultivation of new knowledge which is more suitable to a modern society. Therefore, due to the trend of the campaign for modernization in Taiwan, many young native Taiwanese students went to study abroad, mostly in Japan from the late 1910s and some went to Paris in the 1930s. And indeed they became the pioneers in the era of the flourish cultural movement in Taiwan. It is irrefutable that literature had extraordinary importance in a socio-political and cultural context in the period from the 1920s to around the 1930s with the growing stimulation between writers and painters through shared interest in learning about modernization. The group of artists, painters including some major artists Chen Qingfen, Yang Shilong, Yang Sanlang and Liu Chi-hsiang, are characterized by westernized artistic expression and their own interpretation <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> which represents a modern political and as well as cultural movement that were emerged by the landed-gentry who strongly resist against the Japanese colonial governors. One of the Japanese art critics recounts that the steady economic growth and great increase of public interest in art with numerous art exhibitions by single and group artists had attracted both Taiwanese and Taiwan-born Japanese artists return to Taiwan and share their works with audiences.|$|E

40|$|For {{the study}} of human affairs, there is a {{strategic}} question that directs inquiry: why? Why did persons act the way they did? What were their reasons for so acting? When one seeks to study human affairs <b>of</b> a <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>place,</b> one puts the question “why?” to the persons <b>of</b> that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> seeks to understand their reasons for acting, as they conceive them.

500|$|In {{the final}} chapter of {{the first volume of}} his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776), Gibbon claims that Christians had greatly exaggerated the scale of the persecutions they suffered:After the church had triumphed over all her enemies, the {{interest}} as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering. A convenient distance <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> gave an ample scope to the progress of fiction; and the frequent instances which might be alleged of holy martyrs, whose wounds had been instantly healed, whose strength had been renewed, and whose lost members had miraculously been restored, were extremely convenient for the purpose of removing every difficulty, and of silencing every objection. The most extravagant legends, as they conduced to the honour of the church, were applauded by the incredulous multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy, and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history.Throughout his history, Gibbon implies that the early Church undermined traditional Roman virtues, and thereby impaired the health of civil society. When Gibbon sought to reduce the numbers of the martyrs in his History, he was perceived as intending to diminish the Church and deny sacred history. He was attacked for his suspected irreligion in print. The contemporary classical scholar Richard Porson mocked Gibbon, writing that his humanity never slept, [...] "unless when women are ravished, or the Christians persecuted".|$|E
