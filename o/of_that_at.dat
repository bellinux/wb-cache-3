Surrounded almost entirely by farmland, the highway encounters McCluskey Drive onekilometre (0.62mi) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive twokilometres north <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> <b>At</b> the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the right of way at the intersection. The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the right of way at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} rapid release of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous and destructive historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An eruptive phase can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials are the primary product, typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E
5|$|Bypass US Highway131 (Byp. US131) was a {{bypass route}} around {{downtown}} Grand Rapids. The highway followed 28th Street eastward from the intersection with US131 (Division Street) south of downtown. From this starting point eastward, it ran concurrently with Byp. US16 and Byp M-21. M-37 also followed 28th Street {{at the time}} eastward from the intersection at Kalamazoo Avenue. At the intersection with East Beltline and Broadmoor avenues in Paris Township (now Kentwood), Byp.US16/Byp. US131/Byp.M-21 turned northward to follow East Beltline, and M-37 turned southward on Broadmoor. The bypass route continued northward through Grand Rapids Township. At the intersection with US16/M-50 (Cascade Road), Byp. US16 ended, and Byp. M-21 ended {{less than half a}} mile (0.4km) north <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street). North of the intersection with Fulton Street, Byp. US131 was the only designation along East Beltline Avenue at the time. The highway ran northward into Plainfield Township, and it terminated at an intersection with US131 at Plainfield Avenue and Northland Drive just south of the Grand River.|$|E

25|$|With {{increasing}} depth underwater, sunlight is absorbed, and {{the amount}} of visible light diminishes. Because absorption is greater for long wavelengths (red end of the visible spectrum) than for short wavelengths (blue end of the visible spectrum), the colour spectrum is rapidly altered with increasing depth. White objects at the surface appear bluish underwater, and red objects appear dark, even black. Although light penetration will be less if water is turbid, in the very clear water of the open ocean less than 25% of the surface light reaches a depth of 10 m (33feet). At 100m (330ft) the light present from the sun is normally about 0.5% <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the surface.|$|E

25|$|In his 1996 campaign, Zafy {{blamed the}} {{problems}} faced by Madagascar during his presidency on his opponents and the International Monetary Fund, and he downplayed {{the charges against him}} that had led to his impeachment. Although he had lost much of his support, {{in the first round of}} the election, held on 3 November, he was able to take second place with 23.39% of the vote, behind Ratsiraka's 36.61%. Zafy received some support in the second round from those who, despite their criticisms of Zafy, felt he was preferable to Ratsiraka, such as Interim President Norbert Ratsirahonana, who had unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the first round. In the second round, held on 29 December, Zafy narrowly lost to Ratsiraka, taking 49.29% of the vote and losing by about 45,000 votes. He later alleged that the High Constitutional Court had switched the numbers for himself and Ratsiraka and said that he had not spoken <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the time for the sake of peace.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, the Howard Hall, {{built with}} the benefactions of T.B. Davis to commemorate his son, Howard Davis, who died during World War I, was opened by the Prince of Wales. Davis {{had set up}} the Howard Leopold Davis {{scholarship}} trust in Jersey. One of this educational trust's provisions was that it should benefit boys who, like he, had attended an elementary school. The majority of boys benefiting from this trust went to Victoria College and a number went up to Cambridge or Oxford. In 1934 Davis decided he wanted his old friend, John St Helier Lander, a Jersey artist, to paint a portrait of King George V, to commemorate the endowment of the scholarship. When the commission was complete, the artist and Davis visited the College to discuss where the portrait might be hung. When Davis discovered {{there was no room}} remaining in the College's great hall he decided to build another hall for the school. On 18 October 1934 Davis and his wife laid the foundation stone to Howard Hall. It was built of granite from Ouaisné and matched the gothic style of the older Victoria College buildings. Inside there was seating for 238, almost exactly the number of boys at school when the building was opened. The paneling and woodwork were of teak, and the clock an exact replica <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the Greenwich Observatory. On 23 July 1935 the Prince of Wales came to Jersey to open the Hall and unveil the portrait of King George V. The Hall was refurbished in 1996 and now exists as the Howard Davis Theatre where numerous types of drama are performed by the pupils.|$|E

500|$|The stadium {{has been}} the home of Margate F.C. since 1929, the same year the park itself opened to the public. [...] The local council had {{purchased}} the former grounds of Hartsdown House for public use and built a stadium which it was agreed the football club would lease, initially at a charge of £200 per year. [...] Initially the players had to change in Hartsdown House itself, approximately 200yards from the pitch. [...] A small wooden grandstand with 500 bench seats was soon added, followed shortly afterwards by new dressing rooms and a second stand {{on the north side}} of the ground containing a mixture of standing and seated accommodation. [...] The first ever match at the new stadium was a friendly against Folkestone on 31 August 1929 and the first competitive match a Kent League fixture against Dover two weeks later. [...] In 1934 the club entered into an agreement to become a nursery team for Arsenal, and as part of the agreement the Hartsdown pitch was altered to exactly match the size <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> Highbury.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was first}} {{approached}} by Singer to play Xavier {{on the set}} of 1997's Conspiracy Theory, which was directed by X-Men executive producer Richard Donner. James Caviezel was originally cast as Cyclops, but backed out due to scheduling conflicts with Frequency. James Marsden was unfamiliar with his character, but soon became accustomed after reading various comic books. Marsden modeled his performance similar to a Boy Scout. Eric Mabius expressed interest for the role of Cyclops. Angela Bassett was approached to portray Storm in late 1997, as was Janet Jackson. Anna Paquin dropped out of the lead role in Tart in favor of X-Men. Terence Stamp was considered for Magneto before Singer cast Ian McKellen, who had acted in his previous film, Apt Pupil. McKellen responded to the gay allegory of the film, [...] "the allegory of the mutants as outsiders, disenfranchised and alone and coming to all <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> puberty when their difference manifests," [...] Singer explained. [...] "Ian is an activist and he really responded to the potential of that allegory." ...|$|E
500|$|The species {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the scientific community when explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell observed the trees on his expedition through Queensland in 1848 and published an account in Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia in the same year. He came across them as he ascended Mount Abundance near present-day Roma, remarking that [...] "The trunk bulged out in the middle like a barrel, to nearly twice the diameter at the ground, or <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the first springing of the branches above. These were small in proportion to their great girth, and the whole tree looked very odd In the same publication, English botanist John Lindley provided the first formal description. Lindley placed it in the genus Delabechea as the sole representative—Delabechea rupestris. The genus name was selected by Mitchell to honor the director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Henry De la Beche, while the Latin specific epithet rupestris (meaning living among rocks) alludes to the rocky hilltop habitat of specimens observed by Mitchell. Ferdinand von Mueller, the Government Botanist in Victoria, renamed it Brachychiton delabechei in 1862, incorporating the genus Delabechea into Brachychiton.|$|E

500|$|The {{first weeks}} in the ice were frustrating, as the drift moved unpredictably, {{sometimes}} north, sometimes south; by 19 November Fram's latitude was south <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> which she had entered the ice. Only {{after the turn of}} the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled; the 80° mark was finally passed on 22 March. Nansen calculated that, at this rate, it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. As the ship's northerly progress continued at a rate rarely above a mile (1.6km) a day, Nansen began privately to consider a new plan—a dog sledge journey towards the pole. With this in mind he began to practice dog-driving, making many experimental journeys over the ice. [...] In November Nansen announced his plan: when the ship passed latitude 83° he and Hjalmar Johansen would leave the ship with the dogs and make for the pole while Fram, under Sverdrup, continued its drift until it emerged from the ice in the North Atlantic. After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped Franz Josef Land. They would then cross to Spitzbergen where they would find a ship to take them home.|$|E

Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
