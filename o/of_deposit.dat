NY10, however, continues northeast along the riverbank, passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 crosses over the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of the reservoir. As the reservoir begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{of these}} {{researches}} {{was to determine}} influence of MMA technique and surfacing parameters of gray cast iron using CASTOLIN 27 coated electrodes on quality <b>of</b> <b>deposits.</b> Design/methodology/approach: single layer weave bead deposits and one layer overlapped multi weave bead deposits were MMA surfaced on gray cast iron type GG 25. All deposits were surfaced on no preheated gray cast iron plate. To determine quality <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> hardness HRC measurements on the cross section <b>of</b> <b>deposits,</b> macrostructure and microstructure observations were done. Findings: properties <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> strongly depend on MMA surfacing parameters and the technique of surfacing. Increase of surfacing current (dilution) provided increase <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> hardness. One layer overlapped multi weave bead deposits MMA surfaced with no control of interpass temperature showed higher HRC hardness then deposits MMA surfaced with interpass temp. 20 oC. Research limitations/implications: for complete information about properties of manual metal arc electrodes for gray cast iron cladding it is needed to compare properties of CASTOLIN 27 with other coated electrodes for gray cast iron claddingPractical implications: results {{of this paper is}} to increase quality <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> on gray cast iron.

5|$|With many 9th century Tang era merchants {{avoiding}} {{the weight and}} bulk of so many copper coins in each transaction, this led them to using trading receipts from deposit shops where goods or money were left previously. Merchants would deposit copper currency into the stores of wealthy families and prominent wholesalers, whereupon they would receive receipts that could be cashed {{in a number of}} nearby towns by accredited persons. Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own receipts <b>of</b> <b>deposit,</b> yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade. China's first official regional paper-printed money {{can be traced back to}} the year 1024, in Sichuan province.|$|E
5|$|Banknote: Paper {{currency}} {{was first}} developed in China. Its roots were in merchant receipts <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired {{to avoid the}} heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. During the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the central government adopted this system for their monopolized salt industry, but a gradual reduction in copper production—due to closed mines and an enormous outflow of Song-minted copper currency into the Japanese, Southeast Asian, Western Xia and Liao Dynasty economies—encouraged the Song government in the early 12th century to issue government-printed paper currency alongside copper to ease the demand on their state mints and debase the value of copper. In the early 11th century, the Song Dynasty government authorised sixteen private banks to issue notes of exchange in Sichuan, but in 1023 the government commandeered this enterprise and set up an agency to supervise the manufacture of banknotes there. The earliest paper currency was limited to certain regions {{and could not be}} used outside specified bounds, but once paper was securely backed by gold and silver stores, the Song Dynasty government initiated a nationwide paper currency, between 1265 and 1274. The concurrent Jin Dynasty (1115–1234) also printed paper banknotes by at least 1214.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid).

5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates <b>of</b> <b>deposit.</b> By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement of paper currency was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E
