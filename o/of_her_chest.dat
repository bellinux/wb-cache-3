The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries on the right side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and right knee.|$|E
25|$|Décolletage {{was often}} {{a feature of the}} dress of the late Middle Ages. This {{continued}} through the Victorian period. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.|$|E

When the star was due to rise, the girl was placed and tied on the scaffold. At the moment the star appeared above the horizon, the girl was shot with an arrow, then the priest cut the skin <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> to bleed. She was quickly shot with arrows by all the participating men and boys to hasten her death. The girl was carried {{to the east and}} placed face down so her blood would soak into the earth, with appropriate prayers for the crops and life she would bring to all life on the prairie.|$|E

Her signature weapons are a pair of twin short swords named [...] According to Kung Fu Cult Masters by Leon Hunt, Ayane's [...] "pirrouetting slaps are harder to imagine in a film, but draw from a spinning/twisting dynamics of martial arts choreography." [...] Kasumi's clone Phase 4 uses some of Ayane's fighting style. Team Ninja founder Tomonobu Itagaki described Ayane's character and personality as much [...] "harder" [...] than Kasumi's, making her fit better in the [...] "very hard-edged" [...] universe of the Ninja Gaiden series. His successor Yosuke Hayashi said the image of Ayane covered in her enemies' blood can symbolise the intensity of Ninja Gaiden. Hayashi later requested a special appearance by Ayane in the Fatal Frame series, wherein the developers [...] "spent a lot of time adjusting things like the wobble <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> Team Ninja gave them lots of advice." [...] The game's director Toru Osawa [...] said adding Ayane as a guest character was first suggested by Nintendo.|$|E
500|$|The revamped show in 2014 {{received}} acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show {{praising the}} singer's sex appeal {{and noted that}} although the set included many new songs, the singer [...] "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs". Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list {{was better than the}} original one describing the tour as [...] "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Profile: [...] This is {{a classic}} done by many performers. The {{assistant}} stands side-on to the board and then bends backwards. The impalement artist then aims a series of knives, axes or arrows {{along the line of}} the front edge of the assistant, beginning around the legs and ending with the last throw or shot coming close to the assistant's throat. One aspect of this pose is that it accentuates the vulnerability of the assistant, particularly with the last impact tantalisingly close to the throat. Another important aspect for knifethrowers is that {{the upper part of the}} assistant's body is positioned so that a series of throws can be landed above it - a flexible target girl might be able to place her neck and the upper part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in a horizontal line. A skilled thrower can use the way that a knife turns in flight to land it sloping at a downward angle from the board; thus, the point of the knife can impact safely above the assistant but the rest of the knife can slope down and come very close indeed to the assistant's body, even making contact on some occasions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} of the song kicked off Rouvas' {{successful}} collaboration with photographer and director Yorgos Lanthimos, who {{would go on to}} create the majority of Rouvas' most acclaimed videos over the next two years. Lanthimos won in 2008, the [...] "Off-Cannes" [...] Palme for one of his movies and was nominated for an Oscar in 2010. Similar to some of Rouvas' past videos, the video features sexual content, especially for the time of its release that earned it some criticism, while also making it very popular. It contains four scenes, all on one setting, which is an outdoor patio. The video starts by showing quick flashes of various objects, namely a toy gun, a polaroid camera and photographs, a statue, and beach toys. Throughout the video, flashes of Rouvas singing into the camera can be seen while half-naked, playing around in a small outdoor pool. In another recurring scene, Rouvas' is lying down while shirtless while water continuously spalshes over his torso, while the camera angle is right above him, making it appear as he is being trapped by a glass effect. In {{the second half of the}} video, Rouvas can be seen dancing on the patio wearing an open purple T-shirt. The other scenes feature Rouvas playing around with two young women who have very similar features, although one is blonde and the other is brunette. In one scene, they are dressed in bikinis, feather boas, stilettos and diamond jewelry and are drinking champagne, while in the other they are dressed more casually. Rouvas blindfolds the two women and sends them off to search for him while he is watching. During the bridge of the song, Rouvas places the brunette woman in front of the target and aims to take a shooting stand, finally shooting her with the plastic gun on the right side <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> He then picks up a golf club and shoots the ball, while afterward, he is brought to lie down while the same woman stands over him, taking numerous polaroid photographs while he poses both clothed and in a bathing suit. The video plays with the effects of using fast flashes and off-angle shots in combination with some slow-motion and rewinding shots, such as Rouvas slightly getting out and going fully back into the pool, which is replayed many times.|$|E

60|$|He {{thought of}} this old fancy of his, and it seemed {{impossible}} {{that he should be}} in love with Mildred Rogers. Her name was grotesque. He did not think her pretty; he hated the thinness of her, only that evening he had noticed how the bones <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> stood out in evening-dress; he went over her features one by one; he did not like her mouth, and the unhealthiness of her colour vaguely repelled him. She was common. Her phrases, so bald and few, constantly repeated, showed the emptiness of her mind; he recalled her vulgar little laugh at the jokes of the musical comedy; and he remembered the little finger carefully extended when she held her glass to her mouth; her manners like her conversation, were odiously genteel. He remembered her insolence; sometimes he had felt inclined to box her ears; and suddenly, he knew not why, perhaps it was the thought of hitting her or the recollection of her tiny, beautiful ears, he was seized by an uprush of emotion. He yearned for her. He thought of taking her in his arms, the thin, fragile body, and kissing her pale mouth: he wanted to pass his fingers down the slightly greenish cheeks. He wanted her.|$|E

60|$|Of {{the humble}} treasures of {{furniture}} brought into Titbull's by the inmates when they establish themselves {{in that place}} of contemplation {{for the rest of}} their days, by far the greater and more valuable part belongs to the ladies. I may claim the honour of having either crossed the threshold, or looked in at the door, of every one of the nine ladies, and I have noticed that they are all particular in the article of bedsteads, and maintain favourite and long-established bedsteads and bedding as a regular part of their rest. Generally an antiquated chest of drawers is among their cherished possessions; a tea-tray always is. I know of at least two rooms in which a little tea-kettle of genuine burnished copper, vies with the cat in winking at the fire; and one old lady has a tea-urn set forth in state on the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> of drawers, which urn is used as her library, and contains four duodecimo volumes, and a black-bordered newspaper giving an account of the funeral of Her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte. Among the poor old gentlemen there are no such niceties. Their furniture has the air of being contributed, like some obsolete Literary Miscellany, 'by several hands;' their few chairs never match; old patchwork coverlets linger among them; and they have an untidy habit of keeping their wardrobes in hat-boxes. When I recall one old gentleman who is rather choice in his shoe-brushes and blacking-bottle, I have summed up the domestic elegances of that side of the building.|$|E
6000|$|With the {{pressure}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> against his own, {{and her eyes}} looking into his, Val felt both leg and pocket safe. He should be moderate; Holly was always right--she had a natural aptitude. It did not seem so remarkable to him, perhaps, as it might to others, that--half Dartie as he was--he should have been perfectly faithful to his young first cousin during the twenty years since he married her romantically out in the Boer War; and faithful without any feeling of sacrifice or boredom--she was so quick, so slyly always a little {{in front of his}} mood. Being first cousins they had decided, or rather Holly had, to have no children; and, though a little sallower, she had kept her looks, her slimness, and the colour of her dark hair. Val particularly admired the life of her own she carried on, besides carrying on his, and riding better every year. She kept up her music, she read an awful lot--novels, poetry, all sorts of stuff. Out on their farm in Cape Colony she had looked after all the [...] "nigger" [...] babies and women in a miraculous manner. She was, in fact,--clever; yet made no fuss about it, and had no [...] "side." [...] Though not remarkable for humility, Val had come to have the feeling that she was his superior, and he did not grudge it--a great tribute. It might be noted that he never looked at Holly without her knowing of it, but that she looked at him sometimes unawares.|$|E
60|$|Before to-morrow comes, {{a word or}} two {{respecting}} {{two other}} characters of this history connected with the family of Lord Monmouth. And first of Flora. La Petite was neither very well nor very happy. Her hereditary disease developed itself; gradually, but in a manner alarming to those who loved her. She was very delicate, and suffered so much from the weakness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> that she was obliged to relinquish singing. This was really the only tie between her and the Marchioness, who, without being a petty tyrant, treated her often with unfeeling haughtiness. She was, therefore, now rarely seen in the chambers of the great. In her own apartments she found, indeed, some distraction in music, for which she had a natural predisposition, but this was a pursuit that only fed the morbid passion of her tender soul. Alone, listening only to sweet sounds, or indulging in soft dreams that never could be realised, her existence glided away like a vision, and she seemed to become every day more fair and fragile. Alas! hers was the sad and mystic destiny to love one whom she never met, and by whom, if she met him, she would scarcely, perhaps, be recognised. Yet in that passion, fanciful, almost ideal, her life was absorbed; nor for her did the world contain an existence, a thought, a sensation, beyond those that sprang from the image of the noble youth who had sympathised with her in her sorrows, and had softened the hard fortunes of dependence by his generous sensibility. Happy that, with many mortifications, it was still her lot to live under the roof of one who bore his name, and in whose veins flowed the same blood! She felt indeed for the Marquess, whom she so rarely saw, and from whom she had never received much notice, prompted, it would seem, by her fantastic passion, a degree of reverence, almost of affection, which seemed occasionally, even to herself, as something inexplicable and without reason.|$|E
