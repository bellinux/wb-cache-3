25|$|One {{day during}} <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
500|$|Kavner {{was then}} {{cast as a}} sidekick to Tracey Ullman in The Tracey Ullman Show, which debuted on Fox in 1987. Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
60|$|Old {{tradition}} was strong in us; all English inns {{in those days}} charged the unexpected, and I asked what <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> was to cost.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you," [...] he said, [...] "that nothing {{whatever}} {{could be said}} against <b>our</b> <b>lunching</b> together. People are not so strict nowadays, you know, and a married lady has always {{a great deal of}} latitude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Goot. We shall do our works first: then eat <b>our</b> <b>lunches</b> afterwards. Where is the patients? Come-begin-begin!" [...] He {{removed the}} napkin, blew a sigh (there {{is no other}} way of expressing it)--and plunged his finger and thumb into his tea-caddy snuff-box. [...] "Where is the patients?" [...] he {{repeated}} irritably. [...] "Why is she not close-handy in here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{find the}} air fine, and the {{neighborhood}} respectable," [...] he said, to turn the subject. [...] "Our modest apartments are cool in summer and warm in winter, and remarkably reasonable in price. Patsy gets our breakfast on the stove yonder, and we buy <b>our</b> <b>lunches</b> down town, where we work, and then dine at Danny Reeves's place. A model home, sir, and a happy one, as I hope you'll find it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the Colonel interrupted, [...] "that {{was to be}} <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> hour. I {{remember}} saying that when I came back I would have--O Lord, it's best {{not to think of}} it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What had you {{for your}} own breakfast?' I asked, as I caught Marie's eye hungrily fixed on the rolls and some tempting little cakes of {{chocolate}} left from <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> the day before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I just do! We left <b>our</b> <b>lunch,</b> and I've {{only had}} two little trout and some old berries since breakfast," [...] {{answered}} Billy, {{with tears in}} his eyes and a hand on his stomach.|$|E

6000|$|June smiled upon us once more; {{and on the}} {{afternoon}} of the 13th, the anniversary of <b>our</b> first <b>lunch</b> together at the Le Geyts, I was up at my work in the accident ward at St. Nathaniel's. [...] "Well, the ides of June have come, Sister Wade!" [...] I said, when I met her, parodying Caesar.|$|R
40|$|We take selfies, {{photograph}} <b>our</b> <b>lunches,</b> and use cameras as note‐taking devices. As {{our lives}} play out before us, {{we choose to}} give visual account to our intimate moments, anticipating the reaction of our family and friends. We share these snapshots immediately with them, some of whom live far away from us, thereby establishing ephemeral connections. The present paper entails an empiric investigation done with Spanish-Irish families {{in relation to the}} following research question: How do transnational families use photographs? The methods put in place, the position of the researcher (also a Spanish migrant living in Ireland) and the ethical implications derived, serve both to provide the necessary critical distance for the analysis as well as to introduce a second key question in this paper: how can we discuss personal photography without giving something of ourselves into the text? The narrative crafted below intends to offer a provisional answer...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity we didn't bring <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> along," [...] said Dora to Dick, as {{they moved}} along at a slower rate of speed. [...] "We {{could have had a}} good time picnicking along here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; {{my friend}} Watson {{is a medical}} man, you know, and he'll look after you. We'll have <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> here, if you will permit us, and then we shall all three set off for town together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not tell}} him now?" [...] {{they seemed to}} ask. But he said: [...] "There's a long story to tell before we decide on my career. Let's finish <b>our</b> <b>lunch.</b> How is mother, and how are the girls?" ...|$|E
60|$|For a time I {{seemed quite}} wonderfully {{able to do}} {{whatever}} I wanted to do. Shoesmith responded to my first advances. We decided to create a weekly paper as our nucleus, and Crupp and I set to work forthwith to collect a group of writers and speakers, including Esmeer, Britten, Lord Gane, Neal, {{and one or two}} younger men, which should constitute a more or less definite editorial council about me, and meet at a weekly lunch on Tuesday to sustain our general co-operations. We marked our claim upon Toryism even in the colour of our wrapper, and spoke of ourselves collectively as the Blue Weeklies. But <b>our</b> <b>lunches</b> were open to all sorts of guests, and our deliberations were never of a character to control me effectively in my editorial decisions. My only influential councillor at first was old Britten, who became my sub-editor. It was curious how we two had picked up our ancient intimacy again and resumed the easy give and take of our speculative dreaming schoolboy days.|$|R
5000|$|... “We {{had to take}} <b>our</b> own <b>lunch</b> to school. One of my {{most memorable}} {{experiences}} was when I said something to my mother about the same old lunch. My mother’s reply was {{for me to make}} lunch for myself. Slow to rise in the morning, I had to hurry to arrive at school on time. Forgetting my lunch in the cart in the schoolyard, I went out at noon to find that my pony had eaten it! ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>lunch</b> <b>our</b> hostess {{had told}} me the sad story of an unhappy marriage, and I had itched spiritually {{to find out what}} my friend, who seemed so far away from me, felt about such things. And now I {{determined}} to find out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] Captain Nelson said, {{when they}} left the shop, [...] "it is just <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> time. You must come with me and tell us all about your {{wonderful}} march and the fight at the end of it." ...|$|E

You are probably receiving this Newsletter shortly after returning from the 1996 Joint Statistical Meetings.

40|$|Brent Fultz is a {{brilliant}} scientist, {{but that is not}} what set him apart from other advisors at Caltech to me. It was his wonderfully supportive nature as an advisor that drew my attention. He has always been encouraging. I am constantly impressed by the amount of faith he has in his students. His confidence in us helps us have confidence in ourselves. I am grateful to have had the privilege of being advised by Brent. His gentle guidance not only taught me practically everything I know about our research but has also helped to make my graduate experience a very enjoyable one. I am indebted to all the scientists before me, on whose shoulders I have stood to carry out my work, most recently Peter Bogdanoff and Mike Manley. My time at Caltech would have been much more boring without all my colleagues there who have also become my good friends. Their company and help I appreciate immensely. Olivier Delaire, you have had many wonderful insights into our work. You have also made all those long research trips a blast. Max Kresch, you are a great person and scientist and you have made many valuable contributions to our work. I will continue to treasure my friendship with you and Nessie and I am really going to miss <b>our</b> <b>lunches</b> together! Rebecc...|$|R
60|$|PHILIP. Sh! The {{result was}} that the gum {{architect}} made considerable difficulties about accepting <b>our</b> invitation to <b>lunch,</b> although I doubt if he has had anything but tea and bread and butter for a fortnight past.

60|$|We spent {{considerable}} time {{there on that}} friendly bench, resting {{in the shadows of}} the elms, and while sitting there, we ate <b>our</b> <b>lunch,</b> and watched the traffic of Tremont Street, in perfect content till I remembered that the night was coming on, and that we had no place to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} was greatly {{surprised}} by the suddenness of her capture, and so was Button-Bright. Cap'n Bill {{shook his head and}} said he was afeared they'd get into trouble.

60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>lunch</b> was, as {{the others}} had been, luxurious; but my throat was dry, and I could not eat. Boone's {{appetite}} had also failed, and I may have guessed aright at part of his story when I saw him, after thrice emptying his glass, glance still thirstily at the wine, and then thrust the decanter away.|$|E
60|$|Hollingsworth and I--we {{had been}} hoeing potatoes, that forenoon, {{while the rest}} of the {{fraternity}} were engaged in a distant quarter of the farm--sat under a clump of maples, eating <b>our</b> eleven o'clock <b>lunch,</b> when we saw a stranger approaching along the edge of the field. He had admitted himself from the roadside through a turnstile, and seemed to have a purpose of speaking with us.|$|R
40|$|The invariable mark {{of wisdom}} {{is to see}} the miraculous in the common. —Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nature Increasing {{evidence}} confirms that everyday sunshine is a determinant of health and has {{an important role in}} preventing or ameliorating many afflictions, includ-ing depression, cancer, and postoperative pain. Although sunshine has been used therapeutically throughout his-tory, sun exposure has been discouraged lately with alle-gations that solar rays induce skin cancer.

60|$|A {{singularly}} English atmosphere {{hovers over}} Hanover, especially on Sundays, when its shuttered shops and clanging bells give to it {{the suggestion of}} a sunnier London. Nor was this British Sunday atmosphere apparent only to myself, else I might have attributed it to imagination; even George felt it. Harris and I, returning from a short stroll with <b>our</b> cigars after <b>lunch</b> on the Sunday afternoon, found him peacefully slumbering in the smoke-room's easiest chair.|$|R

[...] "Now I {{come to think of}} it, there's no obvious reason we shouldn't have stopped on board the train and got <b>our</b> <b>lunch</b> comfortably.
