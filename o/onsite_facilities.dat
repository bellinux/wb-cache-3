5000|$|Although the solids {{collected}} by <b>onsite</b> sewage <b>facilities</b> can potentially {{be used as}} compost to build topsoil, these solids are often incompletely decomposed due to either a lack of onsite storage space to wait for decomposition (municipal facilities), or because the solids are being stacked in a layered structure of new waste solids on top of previously decomposed solids (septic tanks and outhouses). Due to the incomplete state of decomposition, when removed from an <b>onsite</b> sewage <b>facility,</b> these solids are typically referred to as sludge rather than compost, and have powerful offensive odors arising from the microorganisms still consuming nutrients in the sludge.|$|R
