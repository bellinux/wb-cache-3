5000|$|On 13 May 1958 {{the car was}} rebuilt internally. The {{conductor}} compartment was reallocated as {{the guard}} compartment, and all the seating was rearranged. The former smoking saloon was cleared out and replaced with a small buffet, plus five semicircle tables against {{the walls of the}} carriage and 12 loose chairs provided. The seats in the <b>observation</b> <b>compartment</b> were removed and replaced with AZ reclining and rotating seat pairs, with six units per side and two final couch seats either side of the flower table against the rear window. In this form, the rear lettering [...] "SPIRIT OF PROGRESS" [...] was replaced with [...] "THE DAYLIGHT", {{but it is not clear}} whether the lettering was gold leaf, or gold or yellow paint. The car stayed on the train until it switched across to standard gauge on 21 April 1962.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War {{the coaches}} were {{taken over by}} the Deutsche Bundesbahn and, in 1954 after {{conversion}} by the firm of Wegmann, operated as a train with second class compartments. Later, following the internationally agreed changeover to a two-class system between 1956 and 1959, the coaches were operated as a first class train under the name Blauer Enzian (Blue Gentian or Gentiana verna), forming the long-distance express service F55/56 between Hamburg and Munich. The train offered the highest levels of comfort. Wegmann converted the former 3rd class compartments in pairs to create larger compartments and the interior was enhanced with swivel chairs. The five coaches of the historic train were only sufficient however for running a single train per day in one direction. The train in the other direction was therefore made up of two saloon cars (one of them from the Hermann Göring train), two unconverted F-Zug dining cars and a trailer car {{similar to those of the}} Henschel-Wegmann Train. From April 1959, however, only new, modern coaches were used. Despite all claims that one trailer car remains today, all five original coaches were retired and scrapped in 1962. The trailer car with its <b>observation</b> <b>compartment,</b> which has been incorrectly assumed to be the original trailer car, comes from the second Blauer Enzian train, that had been specifically built for that service. Today it is in the collection of the Nuremberg Transport Museum.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{cefazolin}} pharmacokinetics in maternal plasma and {{amniotic fluid}} during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Newly collected time-concentrations profiles and reported studies investigating cefazolin disposition (plasma, amniotic fluid) were pooled. Nonlinear mixed effect modeling was applied. A 2 -compartment linear disposition model {{was used to}} fit cefazolin plasma <b>observations.</b> A third <b>compartment</b> was used to model amniotic fluid concentration. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven plasma and 96 amniotic fluid samples were collected in 82 pregnancies (17 - 40 weeks gestational age). Cefazolin clearance and distribution estimates were 7. 44 L/h and 12. 04 L without gestational age-dependent trends in maternal plasma. The equilibration half-life (T(eq)) between plasma and amniotic fluid at term gestational age was 4. 4 hours, increased with decreasing gestational age, and was 9. 09 times longer in patients with polyhydramnios. CONCLUSION: Cefazolin clearance and distribution volume are increased during pregnancy. The cefazolin T(eq) depends on gestational age and polyhydramnios. On {{the basis of these}} observations, dosing regimes to attain higher amniotic fluid concentrations were formulated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A direct {{connection}} between a coupled model system and ensemble data assimilation software allows {{to set up}} a data assimilation program with high flexibility, efficiency, and parallel scalability. The {{direct connection}} can be obtained by extending the source code of the coupled model to create an online-coupled assimilation program. Using a combination of in-memory access and parallel communication with the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, the direct connection avoids the need to stop and restart a whole coupled model system to perform the assimilation of observations in the analysis step of ensemble-based filter methods. Instead, the analysis step is performed in between time steps and is independent of the actual model coupler. This strategy allows us to perform both in-compartment (for weakly coupled assimilation) and cross-compartment (for strongly coupled assimilation) assimilation. The assimilation frequency can be kept flexible, so that assimilation of <b>observations</b> from different <b>compartments</b> can be performed at different intervals. Using the parallel data assimilation framework (PDAF, [URL] the online connection strategy will be exemplified for coupled models using a single executable and such that use multiple executables for different compartments and a model coupler {{as in the case of}} the OASIS-MCT coupled climate model ECHAM 6 -FESOM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Majerda delta {{formation}} {{has been}} the subject of many studies since the late XIXe century. The reconstruction of the fluvial palaeo-environments of the lower Majerda valley is significant as it is critical to understand the decline of Utica following the siltation of the harbor, which is presently buried under sediments. The progression of the delta across the corridor separating the Southern and the Northern compartments of the ancient Utica bay is the cornerstone of our research on the delta. On the basis of a GIS we propose to identify hydro- and morpho-sedimentary processes of the deltaic progradation dynamics. They lead to innovative ways of considering the initial implantation site of Utica, the conditions of harbor siltation and the Majerda River itself across the Northern <b>compartment.</b> <b>Observations</b> and analysis from the GIS allowed highlighting a double system of alluvial fans over the whole delta. The first component which may be described as “torrential” is present throughout the delta fringe, while the second category of flat alluvial fans occurs at the Majerda defluviation sites, forming coalescing alluvial lobes. The ancient merging of these two morphological systems close to Utica could reflect a process of harbor silting more complex than previously considered, the Majerda River being considered as the unique factor of change so far...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{presents}} in {{the first}} section a comprehensive introduction to classical electrodynamics. The reader is acquainted with some basic concepts like right-handed coordinate system, vector calculus, particle and field fluxes, and learns how to calculate electric and magnetic field strengths in different neuronal compartments. Then the exposition comes to explain the basic difference between a passive and an active neural electric process; a brief historical perspective on the nervous principle is also provided. A thorough description is supplied of the nonlinear mechanism generating action potentials in different compartments, with focus on dendritic electroneurobiology. Concurrently, the electric field intensity and magnetic flux density are estimated for each neuronal <b>compartment.</b> <b>Observations</b> are then discussed, succinctly as the calculated results and experimental data square. Local neuronal magnetic flux density is less than 1 / 300 of the Earth’s magnetic field, explaining why any neuronal magnetic signal would be suffocated by the surrounding noise. In contrast the electric field carries biologically important information and thus, as it is well known, acts upon voltage-gated transmembrane ion channels that generate neuronal action potentials. Though the transmembrane difference in electric field intensity climbs to ten million volts per meter, the intensity of the electric field is estimated to be only ten volts per meter inside the neuronal cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHow do viruses {{spread from}} cell to cell? Enveloped viruses acquire their {{surrounding}} membranes by budding. If a newly enveloped virus has budded through the plasma membrane, it finds itself outside the cell immediately. If it has budded through the bounding membrane {{of an internal}} compartment such as the ER, the virus finds itself in the lumen, from which it can exit the cell via the conventional secretion pathway. Thus, although some enveloped viruses destroy the cells they infect, there is no topological need to do so. On the other hand, naked viruses such as poliovirus lack an external membrane. They are protein–nucleic acid complexes within the cytoplasm or nucleus of the infected cell, like a ribosome, a spliceosome or an aggregate of Huntingtin protein. The simplest way for such a particle {{to pass through the}} single lipid bilayer that separates it from the outside of the cell would be to violate the integrity of that bilayer. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} the primary mode of exit for non-enveloped viruses is cell lysis. However, more complex exit strategies are possible, such as the creation of new compartments whose complex topologies allow the exit of cytoplasm and its contents without violating the integrity of the cell. Here we will discuss the non-lytic spread of poliovirus and recent <b>observations</b> of such <b>compartments</b> during viral infection with several different picornaviruses...|$|R
40|$|Discussed is the {{construction}} of programs for efficient ensemble data assimilation systems based on a direct connection between a coupled simulation model and ensemble data assimilation software. The strategy allows us {{to set up a}} data assimilation program with high flexibility and parallel scalability with only small changes to the model. The direct connection is obtained by first extending the source code of the coupled model so that it is able to run an ensemble of model states. In addition, a filtering step is added using a combination of in-memory access and parallel communication to create an online-coupled ensemble assimilation program. The direct connection avoids the common need to stop and restart a whole coupled model system to perform the assimilation of observations in the analysis step of ensemble-based filter methods like ensemble Kalman or particle filters. Instead, the analysis step is performed in between time steps and is independent of the actual model coupler. This strategy allows us to perform both in-compartment (for weakly coupled assimilation) and cross-compartment (for strongly coupled assimilation) assimilation. The assimilation frequency can be kept flexible, so that assimilation of <b>observations</b> from different <b>compartments</b> can be performed at different time intervals.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} known for some time that Salmonella typhimurium is able to survive and even {{replicate}} in the normally bactericidal environment of the macrophage phagosome, the mechanisms by which this organism accomplishes this feat remain obscure. In this study, a murine macrophage cell line and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy were used to more thoroughly define the specific nature of phagosomes containing latex beads or wild-type S. typhimurium (viable or heat-killed organisms). Live S. typhimurium organisms were observed to reside in phagosomes that diverge from the degradative pathway of the macrophage. These compartments contain lysosomal glycoproteins and lysosomal acid phosphatase, endocytic markers delivered to vacuoles by mannose 6 -phosphate receptor-independent mechanisms, but are devoid of the mannose 6 -phosphate receptor and cathepsin L. In contrast, phagosomes containing latex beads or heat-killed organisms appeared to be processed along the degradative pathway of the host cell; these compartments colocalized not only with lysosomal glycoproteins and lysosomal acid phosphatases but also with mannose 6 -phosphate receptors and cathepsin L. The uniqueness of the phagosome containing viable S. typhimurium was confirmed by the <b>observation</b> that these <b>compartments,</b> in comparison to phagosomes containing latex beads, do not readily interact with incoming endocytic traffic. Finally, we show that an isogenic, noninvasive mutant of S. typhimurium, BJ 66, ends up in an intracellular compartment identical to the wild-type S. typhimurium-containing phagosome. Thus, modifications of the Salmonella-containing compartment occur independently of the mechanism of bacterial entry...|$|R
40|$|External flaming from {{buildings}} {{occurs as}} a result of a large amount of fuel being available in the room of fire origin in comparison to the amount of ventilation provided. The size of the openings in a compartment affects the amount of oxygen available within the fire room, and hence the amount of combustion that can take place inside. Excess fuel that is not burnt within the room flows out of the opening and combusts upon reaching the oxygen in the air outside. It is in this situation that flames are seen projecting out of the window. Flames projecting from openings pose the threat of fire spread from the room of fire origin. This threat increases with the size of the flames. Thus a dependable method for predicting the size of flames projecting from openings is required. This research addresses the issue of predicting flame heights projecting from openings, based on the heat release rate of a fire. The results are based on laboratory experiments and are presented in non-dimensional form, allowing application to scenarios that have not been specifically tested. This work supports the findings of other researchers, with appropriate adjustments made to compensate for differing experimental approaches. This indicates that the relationships established between the non-dimensional heat release rate and flame height are formed from a sound underlying principle. An empirical relationship between the non-dimensional flame height and heat release rate of a fire is presented in a simplified format to enable ease of use. The temperatures attained, and other <b>observations</b> from the <b>compartment</b> fire experiments are also presented and discussed. These were found to have dependence on a number of factors, with relationships varying between the individual experiments. The widely-used computational fluid dynamics model Fire Dynamics Simulator, Version 4 (FDS), was found to currently be unreliable in modelling the experimental scenarios. The results obtained were unrealistic and bore minimal resemblance to the experimental results, with extensive computational simulation time. The ability of the programme to model the compartment fire scenario requires further investigation to determine whether a finer grid resolution may improve results, or whether it is simply not able to model combustion processes involved at this stage...|$|R
