5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, the story <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested for the murder <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> widow. Rumours had been circulating since 1935 regarding the frequency of his being named in patients' wills (132 times between 1946 and 1956) and the gifts he was given (including two Rolls Royces). Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which gripped the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he {{is thought to have}} killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Sellers {{appeared in a}} further three television series based on The Goons, which aired on Britain's new ITV channel. The series were The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d, A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred. In 1957 film producer Michael Relph became impressed with Sellers's portrayal <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> character in Idiot Weekly, and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden's The Smallest Show on Earth, supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now {{thought of as a}} minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war era. Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award winning film The Man Who Never Was. Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi's offbeat black comedy The Naked Truth, opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price.|$|E
5|$|Writer Damon Lindelof {{conceived}} Peter Weyland as a {{man with}} a massive ego and a god complex. During the film's early development director Ridley Scott intended Max von Sydow to play Weyland, but he began to favor Guy Pearce when a scene was written with a younger version of the character. To depict Weyland's aging, Pearce wore heavy prosthetics requiring five hours to apply and one hour to remove. The actor worked to replicate the speech patterns and movements <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>elderly</b> man. Although Weyland's younger version was omitted from Prometheus final screenplay, the film marketed the character with a fictional, futuristic TED talk in which Pearce appears without prosthetics. His performance was generally negatively received because of the unconvincing prosthetics and the casting of a 44-year-old actor as a 103-year-old man. However, the Weyland Industries web campaign was recognized by the Key Art Awards. In October 2016, it was reported that Pearce would be reprising his role as a younger version of Weyland in Alien: Covenant.|$|E
