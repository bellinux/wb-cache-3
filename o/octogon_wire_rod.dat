40|$|Very often defects {{are present}} in rolled products. For <b>wire</b> <b>rods,</b> defects are very {{deleterious}} since the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> are generally used directly in various applications. For this reason, the market nowadays requires <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> to be completely defect-free. Any wire with defects must be rejected as scrap which is very costly for the production mill. Thus, {{it is very important}} to study the formation and evolution of defects during <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling in order to better understand and minimize the problem, at the same time improving quality of the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> and reducing production costs. The present work is focused on the evolution of artificial defects during rolling. Longitudinal surface defects are studied during shape rolling of an AISI M 2 high speed steel and a longitudinal central inner defect is studied in an AISI 304 L austenitic stainless steel during ultra-high-speed <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling. Experimental studies are carried out by rolling short rods prepared with arteficial defects. The evolution of the defects is characterised and compared to numerical analyses. The comparison shows that surface defects generally reduce quicker in the experiments than predicted by the simulations whereas a good agreement is generally obtained for the central defect.

40|$|A {{three-roll}} {{process is}} a significant technique {{in the production of}} <b>wire</b> <b>rod,</b> round bars and hexagonal profiles for structural applications. Better mechanical properties of <b>wire</b> <b>rod,</b> round bars and hexagonal profiles can be achieved due to large plastic deformation by the three-roll process. Asymmetric rolling is a novel technique characterised by a kinematic asymmetry linked to the difference in peripheral speed of the rolls, able to introduce additional shear strains through the bar thickness. In order to achieve this, asymmetrical three-roll rolling process was investigated to better control the deformation compared to the conventional three-roll rolling process in a stand with two three-roll calibers located very close to each other. Simulation of round-triangle-triangle pass rolling was performed. FEM simulations were carried out with using software DEFORM 3 D. The influence of the friction coefficient and speed asymmetry on the shear strain and material flow was discussed. The results of simulation can be used to optimize the asymmetric three-roll rolling process to improve the mechanical properties of <b>wire</b> <b>rod,</b> round bars and hexagonal profiles...|$|R
