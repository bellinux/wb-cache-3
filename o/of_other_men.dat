5|$|Boccaccio {{fills in}} the history before the hostage {{exchange}} as follows. Troilus mocks the lovelorn glances <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> who put their trust in women before falling victim to love himself when he sees Cressida, here a young widow, in the Palladium, the temple of Athena. Troilus keeps his love secret and is made miserable by it. Pandarus, Troilus' best friend and Cressida's cousin in {{this version of the}} story, acts as go-between after persuading Troilus to explain his distress. In accordance with the conventions of courtly love, Troilus' love remains secret from all except Pandarus, until Cassandra eventually divines the reason for Troilus' subsequent distress.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} Jack Sparks, a young American, who is {{traveling}} in Turkey. He befriends an aged Turk during a carriage ride and the Turk invites Jack into his home. The man smokes from a hookah and several <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> arrive and {{speak with the}} Turk whilst Jack wanders about the house.

He struggles and overpowers a guard before climbing over the wall and into the courtyard of the Pasha's palace.|$|E

5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

25|$|Much of the Muslim world {{approaches}} the Qur'an {{as a means}} to simply acquire culture and information, to participate in academic discussions and enjoyment.

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{interest}} in Tang poetry {{in the field of}} gender studies. Although most of the poets were men, there were several significant women. Also, many of the men wrote from the viewpoint of a woman, or lovingly <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men.</b> Historically and geographically localized in Tang dynasty China, this is an area which has not escaped interest from the perspective of historical gender roles.|$|E
25|$|The Corpus Hermeticum is {{the most}} widely known Hermetic text. It has 18 chapters, which contain dialogues between Hermes Trismegistus and a series <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men.</b> The first chapter {{contains}} a dialogue between Poimandres (who is identified as God) and Hermes. This {{is the first time}} that Hermes is in contact with God. Poimandres teaches the secrets of the universe to Hermes. In later chapters, Hermes teaches others, such as his son Tat and Asclepius.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} and subsequent direct {{evidence of the}} shooting was documented by video cameras held by passengers on the train idling next to the platform, as police detained Grant and a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> suspected {{of being involved in}} the disturbance.

These videos were made available through television news and internet video.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{arguments}} for early orchiopexy is {{reducing the risk of}} testicular cancer. About 1 in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develops testicular cancer, roughly a 4 to 40 fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the 3rd and 4th decades of life. The risk is higher for intra-abdominal testes and somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended testis of a man whose other testis was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted the}} whole country to know in detail what had {{happened}} at that factory, and to understand what had gone on there—the fruitless...lack of enforcement by the Department of Labor, the whole long lousy history of neglect, deceit and stupidity—was happening in dozens of other ways, in hundreds of other factories, to thousands <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> across the land. I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted them to know that murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one was bothering about it.|$|E

25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time took a very dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were many calls for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the women themselves, or perhaps because of fear that officials would take to stealing the wives <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men.</b> One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art. At the same parties {{during which he}} banged his head against those <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men,</b> Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife. Sage, according to friends’ accounts, made no response to her husband’s aggression except {{to try to persuade}} him to go home. Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage’s painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her. The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy’s death. “Yves was my only friend who understood everything,” she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, an old friend of Tanguy’s, about a month after Tanguy’s fatal stroke.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{males with}} 5α-reductase type II {{deficiency}} exhibit signs of continued undervirilization {{in a number}} of domains. Facial hair was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of Dominican males with the condition. However, more facial hair has been observed in patients with the disorder {{from other parts of the}} world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>men</b> in the same communities. The divergent findings may reflect racial differences in androgen-dependent hair growth. A female pattern of androgenic hair growth, with terminal hair largely restricted to the axillae and lower pubic triangle, is observed in males with the condition. No temporal recession of the hairline or androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type II deficiency that have been reported, whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males. Individuals with 5α-reductase type II deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of acne, but subsequent research indicated normal sebum secretion and acne incidence.|$|E
