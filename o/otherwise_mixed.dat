Smoke is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual purposes. Smoke is sometimes used as a flavoring agent, and preservative for various foodstuffs.

50|$|In grassland, much of {{the organic}} matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling {{on the forest floor}} are the {{principal}} source of soil organic matter in the forest.

Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that <b>otherwise</b> would <b>mix</b> {{much of the}} surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.|$|R

In speaking class, the {{students are required to}} talk only in English, but the fact there is still code switching or code mixing happened in the class. Therefore, the writer would like to find out the types of code switching and code mixing found in Speaking I class, the frequency of the phenomenon to happen, the reason that triggers the phenomenon and the benefit by using code switching and code mixing. To conduct the analysis of this phenomenon, the writer used several methods, such as observation, video recording, and interview. The observation and video recording was conducted in twelve meetings from A to D class of the third semester. And the interview with the lecturer and the representative students was conducted after finishing the video recording. The video recording results were written down into transcripts and then observed to find the answer for research questions. The result of this study showed that there are three types of code switching and code mixing that usually occurred in this class. The types of code switching and code mixing according to the frequency are inter-sentential (1080 utterances), intra-sentential (544 utterances), and tag switching (99 utterances). The average frequency of code switching and code mixing in every meeting is quite often, it is about 57, 7...|$|R
