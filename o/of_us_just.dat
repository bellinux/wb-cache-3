500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled {{anonymously}} {{with the}} celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{appearing}} in the film was Alan Rickman, who portrayed Colonel Brandon. Thompson was pleased that Rickman could express the [...] "extraordinary sweetness [...] his nature," [...] as he had played [...] "Machiavellian types so effectively" [...] in other films. Greg Wise was cast as Marianne's other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old Emilie François, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, {{was one of the}} last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, [...] "Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement – she creates spontaneity in all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> by being there." [...] Other cast members included Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, James Fleet as John Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Spins March Hogan wrote, [...] "'Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> like to read', she sings, and hey, that {{includes}} us. But it's easier to clap {{for something that}} moves or touches you, rather than serves as an advertisement for Gaga as incomprehensible high-end brand." [...] Consequence of Sound wrote in their review, [...] "Gaga's head appears on a black swan and she boogies down in a clam bikini. If this doesn't bump up her sales, I no longer believe in art." [...] Hilary Hughes of Esquire said that the video [...] "hits all the marks of Gaga-esque eccentricity: glitter, boob grabs, weird animals, space, severed limbs, devotional imagery, nudity, neon, etc. It just doesn't redefine those marks, as previous music videos of Gaga's— namely [...] "Bad Romance," [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and [...] "Judas"— have". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that Gaga was parodying herself with the video and suggested that her aim was [...] "to make a video both celebrating and poking fun at her career thus far." [...] However, he considered it forgettable when compared to Gaga's previous efforts.|$|E

500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, those {{voting on}} the bill were later {{surprised}} by the reaction it gained. [...] State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: [...] "The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> voted for it because {{we thought we could}} try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who tried to stop the bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shannon Larkin {{explained}} how {{the band is}} able to walk the line between staying true to their roots {{and being able to}} satisfy themselves creatively, stating, [...] "Usually the riffs decide how new songs come about, with one of us showing the others a riff, and then the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> jamming along until a song starts to form. If the song sounds too far from our roots (or our sound or style) then we can tell after jamming it a few times, and we either drop it or re-work it to sound more true to our roots. Satisfying ourselves creatively is pretty easy, as we aren't trying to re-invent the wheel musically - we are a blue-collar hard rock band. That said, we do side projects in which we can experiment with different textures and styles and scratch any itches to experiment in different genres." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Bauhaus {{released}} {{their first}} new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's {{end and the}} album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said [...] "We were getting along really well, {{but there was an}} incident that occurred", and added that as a result, [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit". In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he [...] "was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable", but in the end, [...] "that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: [...] "You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer".|$|E
2500|$|While touring Europe in late March 1970, Green took LSD at a {{party at}} a commune in Munich, an {{incident}} cited by Fleetwood Mac manager Clifford Davis as the crucial point in his mental decline. Communard Rainer Langhans mentions in his autobiography that he and Uschi Obermaier met Green in Munich, where they invited him to their Highfisch-Kommune. Their real intention was to persuade Green to help arrange for Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones to perform as headline acts at a Woodstock-styled festival in Bavaria. Fleetwood Mac roadie Dinky Dawson remembers that Green went to the party with another roadie, Dennis Keane, and that when Keane returned to the band's hotel to explain that Green would not leave the commune, Keane, Dawson and Mick Fleetwood travelled there to fetch Green. By contrast, Green stated that he had fond memories of jamming at the commune when speaking in 2009: [...] "I had a good play there, it was great, someone recorded it, {{they gave me a}} tape. There were people playing along, a few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>just</b> fooling around and it was... yeah it was great." [...] He told Jeremy Spencer at the time [...] "That's the most spiritual music I've ever recorded in my life." [...] After a final performance on 20 May 1970, Green left Fleetwood Mac.|$|E

People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. And she looked at me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>just</b> someone who loved the movies.
