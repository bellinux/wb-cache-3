5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{countries}} which use a single spoken language throughout may {{have two or}} more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> language. South Africa, which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, {{is a good example}} of this. It has only <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>sign</b> that Ulmanis {{was still}} very popular in Latvia during {{the first years of}} regained {{independence}} was the election of his grand-nephew Guntis Ulmanis as President of Latvia in 1993.|$|E

25|$|Hundreds {{of arrows}} of various sorts {{are used to}} {{indicate}} movement of the hands through space.

25|$|Choline {{deficiency}} {{may play}} a role in liver disease, atherosclerosis, and possibly neurological disorders. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> of choline deficiency is an elevated level of the liver enzyme ALT.

25|$|Research {{has also}} been carried out into the {{neurology}} of bimodal bilinguals, or people who can speak one oral language and <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> language.

The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 bits of data, one overflow bit, and <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> bit (ones' complement representation).|$|E
25|$|Brentari classifies sign {{languages}} as a {{whole group}} determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, <b>one</b> <b>sign)</b> can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine {{the direction of the}} verb's movement (inflection).|$|E
25|$|The {{three primary}} signs of {{fertility}} are basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and cervical position.

25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{multilingualism}} {{have been studied}} {{in the field of}} neurology. These include the representation of different language systems in the brain, the effects of multilingualism on the brain's structural plasticity, aphasia in multilingual individuals, and bimodal bilinguals (people who can speak <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> language and one oral language). Neurological studies of multilingualism are carried out with functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and through observation of people who have suffered brain damage.|$|E
25|$|More precisely, William Rowan Hamilton {{put forth}} the quaternions and biquaternions; James Cockle {{presented}} tessarines and coquaternions; and William Kingdon Clifford was an enthusiast of split-biquaternions, {{which he called}} algebraic motors. These noncommutative algebras, and the non-associative Lie algebras, were studied within universal algebra before the subject was divided into particular mathematical structure types. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> of re-organization {{was the use of}} direct sums to describe algebraic structure.|$|E
