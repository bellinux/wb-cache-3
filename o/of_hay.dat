5|$|On 23 February 1852, Birkenhead docked {{briefly at}} Simonstown, near Cape Town. Most {{of the women}} and {{children}} disembarked along with a number of sick soldiers. Nine cavalry horses, several bales <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> and 35tons of coal were loaded for the last leg of the voyage to Algoa Bay.|$|E
5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E

5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons <b>of</b> <b>hay,</b> and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} <b>of</b> <b>hay,</b> grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks.

5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> or straw, can become {{lodged in the}} eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{people are}} thought to have {{inhabited}} the Riverina for at least 40,000 years. The Wiradjuri people were the original inhabitants of much of south western New South Wales including much of the Riverina region along the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers. Other groups living along the Murrumbidgee included the Nari-Nari on the western plains where the town <b>of</b> <b>Hay,</b> the Muthi-Muthi along the Lowbidgee, Gurendji and the Yida-Yida of Oxley. Along both sides of the Murray River lived the Yorta Yorta people inhabiting the area of the Riverina as far east as the present day city of Albury and as far north as the Finley and Deniliquin districts. The Murray was also home to other groups such as the Bangerang, Baraba-Baraba, Wemba-Wemba, Wadi-Wadi, Dadi-Dadi and Paarkantji communities.|$|E

5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1789, Allen {{traveled}} to South Hero, Vermont {{with one of}} his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load <b>of</b> <b>hay.</b> After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there, and set out the next morning for home. While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route, and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington. The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government, and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{proposed}} {{building a}} dock accessed by the railway for export of coal, iron and limestone, and import <b>of</b> <b>hay,</b> grain and vegetables for the mining districts. The idea was also attractive to railway developers of the period. The Ogmore Valley Railway Company wanted to increase revenue by carrying coal for shipment to the docks at Cardiff and Penarth. H. Voss, the engineer of the Ely Valley Railway Company and the Great Western Railway, also saw its commercial potential, {{and made a}} proposal to Jenner of Wenvoe Castle to build a dock at Barry, {{the largest in the}} district, which would be connected by rail to Peterston-super-Ely on the main South Wales line.|$|E

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|Most European {{countries}} have {{taken steps to}} conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies; {{there is also an}} overall European action plan. The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing the timing and method <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries. Where breeding sites impinge on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake. The corn crake {{does not appear to be}} seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.|$|E
5|$|Though the Teton Range {{was never}} {{permanently}} inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley {{to the east}} of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>hay</b> and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to {{the west side of the}} Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman.|$|E

40|$|The {{recommended}} diets of pet {{rabbits and}} herbivorous rodents are {{often based on}} hays (dried forages) as the staple diet item. The rationale for this recommendation {{is a combination of}} logistical factors (i. e., hays are more readily available than a constant supply of fresh forage) and health concerns (i. e., using hays rather than fruits, nonleafy vegetables, and grain products apparently circumvents several health problems). Offering a variety <b>of</b> <b>hays</b> is a feeding concept that has so far received little attention. The choice <b>of</b> <b>hays</b> should be based primarily on a hygienic evaluation. Although hays have to be of impeccable hygienic quality, they need not necessarily be of high nutritive quality. A high proportion of stems and high-fiber material may be adequate for the maintenance <b>of</b> herbivores, and <b>hays</b> <b>of</b> higher nutritional quality can be used as dietary supplements in animals with increased energy requirements. Educating pet owners about the use <b>of</b> multiple <b>hay</b> combinations and the appreciation of the nutritive variety <b>of</b> <b>hays</b> may represent an opportunity for channeling interest and engagement in their animal while concurrently providing a preventive health measure...|$|R
