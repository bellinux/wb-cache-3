[...] Critics were very kind to Yeezus regarding critical reviews, but others viewed the release as [...] "musical and commercial suicide," [...] and [...] "fans live-blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook." [...] The New Yorker Sasha Frere-Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the [...] "lean vibrancy" [...] of the album.

500|$|Ken Barnes from USA Today {{noted that}} major events in Madonna's life were {{repeated}} throughout the book.

He concluded by saying that overall the biography seemed [...] "too familiar. Maybe that's because, at least since she hit the mass-culture spotlight in 1983 with 'Holiday' and hijacked it wholesale the next year with 'Like a Virgin' and 'Material Girl', Madonna, now 49, has lived her life in public like few other artists. The records, tours and videos have been thoroughly documented, as have the liaisons and the controversies (from the Sex book {{all the way up to}} the Malawi orphan adoption)." [...] Lyn Barber from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review of the book, calling it far inferior to author J. Randy Taraborrelli's , released in 2002. Like Churchwell, Barber did not understand why over-emphasis was given on the singer's albums, leaving out details about her personal life. The reviewer listed one positive aspect of the book, the info on Madonna's childhood and a detailed insight into her family.

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru {{was one of their}} favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as [...] "the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X" [...] due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as [...] "an unlikely hero" [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the [...] "great moment" [...] in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his [...] "sheer intellect", calling him [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> characters in the series" [...] and [...] "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime".

500|$|Website reviewers deemed Soul Reavers {{gameplay}} too non-linear and {{its objectives}} too unclear. GameSpot criticized the warp system for using confusing symbols that did {{little or nothing}} to indicate the warp's destination, and weighed the fun of impaling vampires with the Soul Reaver against the lack of challenge presented by bosses and most enemies. Next Generation Magazine considered the game challenging due to [...] "difficult puzzles and lack of a map", requiring the player to backtrack. The Tampa Tribune also criticized the camera controls, though noted that the [...] "auto-facing" [...] feature made the difficulties negligible. PC Zone criticized the PC port of the game for [...] "chunky" [...] graphics and bad camera controls, stating [...] "it feels too much like a PlayStation release ported hurriedly on to the PC". Computer Gaming World similarly felt that the limitations of the PlayStation carried over in the PC port, rendering the latter's visuals [...] "mind-numbingly boring". The publication praised the Lucifer-based story for engaging players, but was disappointed that [...] "it peters out in an unsatisfying climax". Game Informer stated, [...] "Even after years in development, Soul Reaver doesn't feel finished. It feels rushed." [...] 1UP.com ranked Soul Reaver second on its [...] "Top 5 Games That Ended Halfway Through", stating [...] "it's pretty clear that the plot {{would have been a lot}} different if the money hadn't inconveniently run out." [...] GamesRadar placed Soul Reaver at #4 on a 2007 list of the top seven video game apocalypses, regarding the post-apocalyptic Nosgoth as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> wastelands we've ever explored".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Chuck Dixon’s Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) {{led to the}} comic series Birds of Prey {{starring}} the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form {{the nucleus of the}} Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: [...] "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She’s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she’s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place." [...] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon’s origin with the miniseries [...] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.|$|E

500|$|Del Toro and Bickford hired screenwriter Benjamin A. van der Veen {{to write}} the screenplay's first drafts, and their {{extensive}} research took them to Cuba where they met with several of the remaining members of Guevara's team in Bolivia {{as well as the}} revolutionary's wife and children. [...] It was during this phase of development that the filmmakers discovered Terrence Malick had been in Bolivia as a journalist in 1966 working on a story about Che. [...] Malick came on as director and worked on the screenplay with van der Veen and Del Toro, but after a year-and-a-half, the financing had not come together entirely and Malick left to make The New World, a film about Jamestown, Virginia. Afraid that their multi-territory deals would fall apart, Bickford and Del Toro asked Steven Soderbergh, who was previously on board as producer, to direct. The filmmaker was drawn to the contrast of [...] "engagement versus disengagement. Do we want to participate or observe? Once Che made the decision to engage, he engaged fully. Often people attribute that to a higher power, but as an atheist, he didn't have that. I found that very interesting". Furthermore, he remarked that Guevara was [...] "great movie material" [...] and [...] "had one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>fascinating</b> lives" [...] that he could [...] "imagine in the last century". Bickford and Del Toro realized that there was no context for what made Guevara decide to go to Bolivia. They began looking for someone to rewrite the screenplay; [...] Peter Buchman was recommended to them because he had a good reputation for writing about historical figures, based on a script he worked about Alexander the Great. He spent a year reading every available book on Guevara in preparation for writing the script. The project was put on hold when Bickford and Del Toro made Traffic with Soderbergh.|$|E

Roger Newcomb of the website We Love Soaps wondered if the character would [...] "have issues with his parents the way other aged kids on the show have of late".
