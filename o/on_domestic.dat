5|$|Chamberlain saw his {{elevation}} to the premiership as {{the final}} glory in {{a career as a}} domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> affairs.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{were arrested}} {{at the various}} protests. About 600 were arrested in Cairo, {{including}} 8 Egyptian journalists protesting against the government's reported restrictions <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> and Middle Eastern affairs.

5|$|International flights that {{bypassed}} traditional hub {{airports and}} landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this eroded the 747's original market. However, many international carriers {{continued to use}} the 747 on Pacific routes. In Japan, 747s <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> routes were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity.|$|E
50|$|The above given {{definition}} of HFCE includes expenditure by resident households <b>on</b> the <b>domestic</b> territory and expenditure by resident households abroad (outbound tourists), but excludes any non-resident households' expenditure <b>on</b> the <b>domestic</b> territory (inbound tourists).

30|$|Regarding {{the other}} variables, the {{estimated}} coefficient in each region regression model is nearly consistent, {{which indicates that}} capital, labor, and R&D have a relatively stable influence <b>on</b> the <b>domestic</b> industry added value. These factors all have positive and significant effects <b>on</b> the <b>domestic</b> industry added value. However, the influence of labor <b>on</b> the eastern <b>domestic</b> enterprises is negative but not significant. Because the investment of the eastern industrial sector {{that focuses on the}} development of capital intensive industries and the absorption of the labor force is very limited and excludes labor, the non-absorbed labor force is unemployed, and unemployment will hinder the improvement of the eastern industrial sector and produce negative effects <b>on</b> the <b>domestic</b> industry added value.|$|R

5|$|Access {{to foreign}} {{carriers}} <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> routes is disallowed, while international flights {{will be subject}} to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines first have to own and operate an Indonesian-based airline. An example of this practice is Indonesia AirAsia, a branch of Malaysian AirAsia; it previously operated as local airline Awair in 2004, before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005.|$|E

JAL operated the -100BSR SUD with 563 seats <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> routes until their retirement {{in the third}} quarter of 2006. While only two -100BSR SUDs were produced, in theory, standard -100Bs can be modified to the SUD certification.

Increased competition resulted in changes to the airline's corporate structure, and it was reorganised into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including mail) service.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may prey <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> {{rabbits and}} guinea pigs {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes {{frequently}} encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E

5|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo's Chongqing model concerned the city's economic policies.

He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> consumption, rather than export-led growth. During his tenure, Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average. In 2008, for instance, nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8%, while Chongqing reported 14.3%; the same year, foreign trade rose by 28%, and bank loans were up 29%.|$|E
