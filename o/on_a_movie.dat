25|$|Videotape {{technology}} {{was still in}} its infancy when Australian television was launched in 1956 and video recorders did not become widely available to Australian TV stations until the 1960s. For the first few years, the only available method for capturing TV programs was the kinescope process, in which a fixed movie camera filmed broadcasts screened on a specially adjusted TV monitor. Similarly, the playback of pre-recorded programs to air was only possible at this stage through the telecine process, in which films or kinescoped TV recordings were played back <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> screen which was monitored by a TV camera.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Hung was {{selected}} by a teacher who had connections to the Hong Kong film industry to perform stunts <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> This brief foray into the industry piqued his interest in film and he took particular interest {{in the operation of}} film cameras. As the eldest of the troupe, Hung would give his opera school brothers pocket money from his earnings, endearing him greatly to his young friends. Shortly before leaving the Academy at the age of 16, Hung suffered an injury that left him bedridden for an extended period, during which time his weight ballooned. After finding work in the film industry as a stuntman, he was given a nickname after a well-known Chinese cartoon character, Sam-mo (三毛; Three Hairs).|$|E
500|$|The film's setting {{proved to}} be a {{potential}} problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on a shoe-string budget. He and the film's production designer Joe Alves rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard {{to make it look like}} a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> back lot but Alves nixed that idea [...] "because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot." [...] They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), [...] "on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America," [...] producer Debra Hill remembers.|$|E

500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|Tyler {{attended}} the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, {{before returning to}} New York City with her mother at age 12. She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone." ...|$|E

On the episode itself, Edelstein commented: [...] "It is very interesting what happens {{in the first half of}} the finale in terms of learning about how House sees people and getting the world from his point of view entirely". Before the filming of the scene started, Edelstein showed the dance to Hugh Laurie, who, according to Edelstein, was [...] "incredibly supportive, like a cheerleader". Edelstein commented that after the scene was filmed she, [...] "felt beautiful, and it ended up being a really lovely experience".|$|E

500|$|E.T. {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} video games based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> GamePro, GameTrailers, and Bowen cite the game as the first poor quality-film–video-game tie-in. Patrick O'Luanaigh of SCi Games called it the most famous disaster story among film-inspired video games as well as within the industry. Describing it as one of the [...] "games that changed the world", GamePro stated that E.T. established a standard of subpar quality video games based on movies. They further commented that other publishers adopted similar marketing and production practices with licensed movie properties. The publication listed the game as the second [...] "worst movie game ever", citing it {{as an example of how}} poor gameplay can bring negative reception to strong licenses. Surviving copies of the game are commonly found on eBay selling for low prices – the appeal for some collectors comes from the often-designated title of [...] "the worst video game of all time".|$|E
500|$|After {{negotiations}} completed, Kassar called Howard Scott Warshaw on July 27, 1982 {{to commission}} him as developer {{of the video}} game. Kassar informed him that Spielberg asked for Warshaw specifically and that development needed {{to be completed by}} September 1 to meet a production schedule for the Christmas holiday. Though Warshaw had spent more than a year working on consecutive development schedules for games (seven months working on Yars' Revenge and then six months on Raiders of the Lost Ark), he accepted the offer based on the challenge of completing a game in a short time frame and at Spielberg's request. Warshaw considered it an opportunity to develop an innovative Atari 2600 game based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> he enjoyed, [...] "provided we reach the right arrangement". Kassar reportedly offered Warshaw [...] and an all-expenses-paid vacation to Hawaii in compensation. Kassar then told him to arrive at the San Jose Airport a few days later to have a meeting with Spielberg.|$|E
