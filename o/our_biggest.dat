Instead, they chose [...] "to turn <b>our</b> <b>biggest</b> card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time, so they're still dented and rocked by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The nice thing with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked.

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when <b>our</b> <b>biggest</b> story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
