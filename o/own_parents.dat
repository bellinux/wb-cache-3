25|$|Members often unconsciously {{identify}} the group therapist and other group members with their <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> and siblings {{in a process}} that is a form of transference specific to group psychotherapy. The therapist's interpretations can help group members gain understanding of the impact of childhood experiences on their personality, and they may learn to avoid unconsciously repeating unhelpful past interactive patterns in present-day relationships.|$|E

25|$|In 1858, in {{a highly}} publicized case, the police of the Papal States seized a 6-year-old Jewish boy, Edgardo Mortara, from his parents. A Christian servant girl of the family, fearing he would die, had {{reportedly}} informally baptized him six years prior while he was ill. The Papal state law forbid Christians being raised by Jews, even their <b>own</b> <b>parents,</b> and considered the informal baptism of the infant a valid religious conversion. The incident provoked widespread outrage amongst liberal Catholics and non-Catholics, {{and contributed to the}} growing anti-papal sentiment in Europe. The boy was raised in the papal household, and was eventually ordained a priest at age 21.|$|E

25|$|At St Thomas' {{along with}} running the {{out-patient}} clinic for children, she conducted research and gathered around her a multidisciplinary group of practitioners. Frommer {{was one of}} the earliest in the field to identify childhood depression. Part of it she believed was due to parental experiences of separation from their <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b> When she was practising, many World War II evacuees had become parents and their children were displaying the disturbances Frommer had discovered. In some cases, she prescribed newly developed antidepressant medications in very small doses. This was a controversial approach that attracted both international interest and local criticism from some colleagues. Another innovation was to establish formal links with the burgeoning Art Therapy movement. Frommer offered internships in her department to art therapy students from the original St Alban's School of Art course, followed by students from other London courses.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October, the Rivonia Trialists were {{formally}} charged. On 13 June 1964, Mbeki organised a {{march from}} Brighton to London, after the Rivonia Trialists {{were found guilty}} of high treason. They {{were expected to be}} sentenced to death. The students held a night march to 10 Downing Street and handed a petition, signed by 664 staff and students at Sussex University, to the Prime Minister. Thereafter, they held a demonstration outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square. The next day, London television showed Mbeki leading the march. This kind of lobbying helped the Trialists, who were spared the hangman's noose. For the next three decades, Mbeki would take up the job of rallying support against apartheid. Mbeki completed his bachelor's degree in economics at Sussex University in May 1965. With his <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> unable to attend his graduation ceremony, Adelaide Tambo and Michael Harmel took their place at the event. While in London, Mbeki spent all of his summers with the Tambo family.|$|E

25|$|Setsuna F. Seiei is {{the primary}} protagonist of Mobile Suit Gundam 00. He was {{discovered}} by Celestial Being {{at the age of}} 16 for having special potential as a pilot. He is a Gundam Meister and pilots Gundam Exia, specialized in melee combat. The group pursues the complete eradication of armed conflict mainly through the deployment of the revolutionary Gundam units in aggressive armed interventions. Setsuna's real name is Soran Ibrahim; with Setsuna being his codename. He was once a child soldier of Krugis descent in the war-torn Krugis Republic. During this time, he murdered his <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> under Ali Al-Saachez's influence in order to prove his devotion to God, and hence bears a deep hatred towards Saachez. Due to his previous religious brainwashing (and awakening from it), Setsuna claims he no longer believes in God, yet still debates the role of God in people's lives, suggesting {{that he would like to}} believe in God. Across the series, Setsuna appears mostly stoic being indifferent to potential love interest such as princess Marina Ismail.|$|E
25|$|Abraham's {{personality}} and character {{is one of}} the most in-depth in the whole Quran, and Abraham is specifically mentioned as being a kind and compassionate man. Abraham's father is understood by Muslims to have been a wicked, ignorant and idolatrous man who ignored all of his son's advice. The relationship between Abraham and his father, who in the Quran is named Azar, is central to Abraham's story as Muslims understand it to establish a large part of Abraham's personality. The Quran mentions that Abraham's father threatened to stone his son to death if he did not cease in preaching to the people. Despite this, the Qur'an states that Abraham in his later years prayed to God to forgive the sins of all his descendants and his parents. Muslims have frequently cited Abraham's character as an example of how kind one must be towards people, and especially one's <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b> A similar example of Abraham's compassionate nature is demonstrated when Abraham began to pray for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah after hearing of God's plan through the angel Gabriel for them. Although the angel Gabriel told Abraham that God's plan was the final word, and therefore Abraham's prayers would be of no effect, the Quran nonetheless reinforces Abraham's kind nature through this particular event.|$|E

Around three weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother decided to apply for disability benefits for the blind in nearby Temple City, California and brought Genie with her, but on account of her near-blindness Genie's mother accidentally entered the general social services office next door. The social worker who greeted them instantly sensed something was wrong when she saw Genie and was shocked to learn her true age, having estimated from her appearance and demeanor that she was around 6 or 7 and possibly autistic, and after she and her supervisor questioned Genie's mother and confirmed Genie's age they immediately contacted the police. Genie's parents were arrested and Genie became a ward of the court, and due to her physical condition and near-total unsocialized state a court order was immediately issued for Genie to be taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.|$|E
