40|$|A major {{operation}} to promote out-of-season crops {{was established in}} 1984 in Niger to help people overcome {{the worst of the}} drought It generated considerable popular support: many government agencies and departments, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and agricultural officials all coordinated their efforts in order that the most appropriate sites for such crops could be identified and used. Foreign aid, such as that from UNICEF, the World Bank, the European Development Fund, the French Cooperation Ministry, and the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, helped to finance the operation, notably for the necessary inputs such as seeds and the improvement of water sources for irrigation. At the same time, other drought-stricken countries in the Sahel also launched intensive programmes to develop out-of-season crops. Such cultivation is now considered to be the best way of exploiting groundwater sources whose often hidden potential has only lately been recognized. After operating for two years, a preliminary evaluation can now be made of this approach. When first launched in Niger, its promoters not only saw it as a means to deal with the immediate crisis but also as part of a long-term development process. But with the return of more or less ~ normal rainfall patterns, have these crops been abandoned as emergency measures that are no longer necessary ? Or have they been integrated as part of the permanent farming practices in the regions concerned ? Although this type of out-of-season cultivation is often associated by many with Niger, it is not restricted to this country. In Senegal, market gardens flourish even in the dry season. In Mali, government programmes have strived for years to diminish climatic risks by promoting <b>out-of-season</b> <b>vegetable</b> production. But in Niger the 'renaissance' of this kind of cultivation was particularly innovative and well organized. At the same time, the drought {{over the past few years}} also tended to bring to the fore a form of traditional cultivation, practised mostly by women, that had never been given much importance. Over the last two years, the amount of land used for out-of-season crops increased by between two and three fold in some of these countries. In Niger, for example, it is estimated that 62, 000 ha were under out-ofseason crops in 1985 as opposed to only 29, 000 ha in 1983. It is still too soon to say whether such crops will be maintained or whether they will regress, despite the improved climatic conditions. It seems clear, however, that integrating an emergency measure into the normal farming routine raises several questions that must be addressed if out-of-season cropping is to continue. Out-of-season crops were launched during a crisis when emergency conditions overruled normal economic and technological considerations. Now regarded as a long-term option under normal conditions, these crops are no longer cost-effective. Once seen as miracle solutions during the drought, out-ofseason crops must now be evaluated under more objective economic, social and technological conditions. In Niger, the cost of the operation begun in 1984 reached $US 2. 4 million for a production between 30 - 40, 000 tonnes. One of the major operating costs was that for water supply which, although variable, was always significant. For the moment, the contribution to producers' income is moderate. If intensified, modernized and extended, these crops could in the long term show their worth and justify the investment that they now demand. For they are not only a solution to replace unreliable rain-fed cereal crops but also a source of supplementary income. Coming as they do during the dry season, which is generally a period of low agricultural activity in the Sahel, they prolong the working season. Out-ofseason production, an important source of supplementary food, thus generates income during a period when other sources have dried up. Even if the sale of such produce rarely generates significant income (except for those who specialize in export crops or in supplying cities from peri-urban areas), such revenue becomes important because of its timing. It provides much needed cash during the off-season and enables farmers to have a more regular source of income. Many were very interested in this aspect and asked the appropriate agencies to help them develop such crops. Certain individuals even took the initiative themselves to dig deep wells and to improve their plots, more or less successfully. But with other people, there was some reluctance to adopt a practice being promoted by a government agency. This shows the need for extension and community development work so that out-of-season cultivation can become a community-based initiative rather than a government project. Among the reasons for hesitation insofar as subsistence cultivators are concerned, is the resistance to change food habits. In the absence of millet, people are obliged to incorporate leafy green vegetables, carrots, radishes and tomatoes in their diet. But when there is no shortage of millet, what can be done to encourage the continued consumption of these complementary foodstuffs ? Nutritionists believe western vegetables improve the local diet, but more promotional work is needed to deal with resistance caused by lack of familiarity. A movement currently underway, however, tends to favour the distribution of seeds for local crops, such as cowpeas, cassava, onions and sorghum, which can also be grown under irrigation during the dry season. As for out-of-season cash crops, they are much more difficult to develop. One cannot transform a subsistence garden plot into a commercial operation without overcoming many barriers. In order to sell produce, there must be a market. But such a market does not yet exist for such products. The gardens produce the same supplies that already swamp the markets. Another problem is the lack of infrastructure for the transportation and distribution of such perishable products: certain markets are undersupplied while others are oversupplied. Because they are isolated and poorly informed about market conditions, market gardeners are unable to gear their production to demand. Information flow should be improved to avoid wastage and to ensure that they benefit as much as possible from their work. An intermediary solution to this problem would be to store, dry, preserve and process such products on-site. Research in this field has already produced some results: most of this produce can be dried, primarily with solar enerav. The process consists of extracting the water from the product in order to block degradation caused by enzyme action and oxidation and to stop decomposition by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and moulds. Small local projects have already produced appropriate solutions, such as the solar dryer which is very simple, inexpensive, has a large capacity and can be constructed with a standard bed, matting, thatch and mosquito netting. The surplus vegetables produced out of season that cannot be sold in the markets can thus be kept from one year to the next. While there may be losses of vitamins during the drying process, most of the nutritional value of such foodstuffs is maintained. It is thus a promising approach insofar as the producers are unable to control the post-harvest cycle of their produce and have no guaranteed markets when they plant their crops. But this still requires that producers learn such techniques and that consumers adopt the habit of buying dried vegetables. Some dried products, such as potatoes and onions, have already become accepted but it is much more difficult for green vegetables such as lettuce and green beans. However, solutions to the technical and organizational problems of marketing such products represent only one of the ways of encouraging out-of-season crops, which remain a difficult agricultural activity that demands considerable attention and investment. The emergency efforts have shown the problems that could be posed by the supply of inputs, notably seeds, especially those adapted to tropical conditions. The supply of hybrid corn seed, for example, was a failure. Without knowing that hybrid seeds cannot regenerate, farmers kept some of their harvest to sow the next season, not realizing that this traditional practice was useless in this case. European vegetable varieties also proved to be poorly adapted to the ecological and phytopathological conditions of the Sahel. Thus a first priority is the development of adapted seeds that can produce and be distributed throughout the country. Such production of good, local seeds implies the development of better nurseries, the selection of appropriate varieties and the improvement of seed storage techniques. It is also necessary to improve growing techniques for out of season crops, by improving, for example, water extraction. On average, a square metre plot requires at least 20 litres per day. With only simple watering utensils and a 5 m well, one must draw water all day and all night in order do get the 5 cubic metres needed to irrigate a 250 square metre plot. With a Kutasa, or Chadouf, a balance well common throughout the tropics, it takes only three hours. Better still is the oxen-powered Dellou system which reduces the time to one hour and requires little human exertion. Thus the method of water extraction chosen for out-of-season cropping is clearly very important. Significant improvements can be made in irrigation techniques: more accurate spraying and better channelling and holding systems, can when ~ scientifically >> designed increase production with minimal water consumption. Agricultural extension workers can help in all of these tasks provided they receive additional training. Out-of-season crops are all too often ignored in agricultural courses because they are not considered to be important. However, now that they have begun to make a contribution to the national economy, they will no doubt receive more attention from trainina institutions. More widespread and better understood and organized, out-of-season crops whether seen as a dubious investment or a crisis solution can become an important development tool. The word ''mobilization' has often been used with reason to describe operations undertaken to combat the drought in the Sahel. In order to avoid a 'demobilization', these crops can continue to play an important role in both local agricultural practices and the national economy.

40|$|African and Caribbean {{countries}} {{pioneered the}} export of fresh tropical fruits and <b>out-of-season</b> <b>vegetables</b> to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial {{share of the market}} to new exporters from Latin America and Asia. Many ACP countries have the climate, soils, water resources and the skills to produce quality products: a determined effort is needed to win back a larger share of what is now an expanding market. Fruit and vegetable production has a multiple role in ACP countries: as a source of food for local markets and for export; as a provider of employment and as a source of foreign exchange. A majority of countries would benefit from increasing their production of horticultural crops. This would raise national nutritional levels and provide a larger production base from which the best quality produce could be selected for export. Several African and Caribbean countries are already engaged in exporting what at first appear to be large quantities of fruit and vegetables: Cote d'Ivoire produces 20, 000 tonnes of mangoes, 200, 000 tonnes of pineapples and 1. 5 million tonnes of bananas each year, mostly for export; the Caribbean is also a major exporter of bananas, Kenya has developed exports of pineapples and French beans, Zambia exports mangetout peas, Burkina Faso exports mangoes and Madagascar exports litchis. However, in world trade terms ACP exports to the EC are both relatively small and heavily reliant on fruit, particularly bananas. Of the nine million tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables imported into the EC in 1990, 96 % was fruit ando nly 10 % (920, 000 tonnes) was from ACP States. Of this, 46 % came from the Caribbean, 39 % from West and Central Africa and 15 % from East Africa and the Indian Ocean and Pacific States. If bananas, on which the Caribbean countries are highly dependent, are excluded, the total tonnage exported by ACP States was 300, 000 tonnes (3. 3 % of total EC imports), of which only 40, 000 tonnes (0. 45 %) were vegetables. How competitors succeed ACP countries obviously face keen competition, in particular from Central, South American and Asian countries but also from the Mediterranean region. Under the Lome Convention ACP agricultural and horticultural exports have enjoyed an advantage, entering the EC without the tariffs levied on many products from non-ACP producers. But with the eventual prospect of a single market within the EC and the removal of tariffs, ACP exporters must be prepared to produce fruit and vegetables of the highest quality at a competitive price and to supply a consistent volume. Mediterranean and Near-East countries have lower transport costs, being closer to Europe, but Asian and Latin American exporters are more distant than those in Africa. The success of Asian and Latin American exporters has been based on thorough market research to identify consumer preferences, funding of research to develop new, high yielding, flavoursome and visually attractive varieties, and disciplined production and investment in cold storage, transport and marketing promotion. The mango is a fruit which has enormous potential in the European market yet the ACP share of EC imports has dropped from 40 % in 1981 to 18 % in 1990. Meanwhile Central and South American countries, notably Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela have increased their market share in the same period from 36 % to 61 %. These countries are able to supply the European market for six months of the year, long enough to build up a good business relationship with European importers, whereas the ACP season is much shorter. Major exporters are also constantly monitoring the market and are prepared to abandon varieties or product lines if they recognise that consumer demand is changing or if a competitor develops an unassailable advantage. They are also flexible enough to develop new products rapidly. Meeting the challenge At present 70 % of ACP fruit supply to the EC consists of bananas: pineapple, citrus and coconut make up a further 27 %. All other fruit, i. e. 25, 000 tonnes, comprises only 3 % of the total. Research into the opportunities for extending this 'basket of fruit' needs to be undertaken. COLEACP, the marketing organization responsibile for trade links between ACP countries and the EC is able to assist with advice and market information. The Deputy Director, Mme C. Guichard, believes that challenges can be met and cites several successful examples, particularly {{the export of}} avocado and kiwifruit. Several African and Caribbean countries have risen to the challenges posed by aggressive competitors. Kenya has developed horticultural exports, including French beans, strawberries, avocado, pineapple and carnations, which are now worth US$ 16 million/year. With the decline in coffee prices these products have become an increasingly important source of foreign exchange. Zimbabwe has developed profitable export of mangoes, strawberries, bananas, grapes, citrus and kiwifruit. Cote d'Ivoire has long been a major exporter of pineapples and Ghana is trying now to emulate its neighbour. Burkina Faso exports French beans and mango. Madagascar exports 4200 tonnes of litchis per year 1000 tonnes by air and 3200 tonnes by sea; with an annual production of 35 - 40, 000 tonnes, there is ample scope for increasing the proportion exported. The Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit of the Eastern Caribbean States, based in Dominica, is actively pursuing a diversification programme to reduce dependence on bananas, coconut and limes and the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) is undertaking research to broaden the base of varieties of passion fruit and citrus grown in member countries, and to develop pro auction of new product lines including carambola, soursop and sapodilla. Unfortunately fruit and vegetable research has not been given a high priority in ACP countries over the last 30 years and also there has been a lack of training in horticulture. Dr Linda Wickham, Assistant Dean of Research at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad, believes that research, particularly in the field of post-harvest technology, is essential. She also recognizes the need to educate producers in the Caribbean to recognize that their own criteria for selection of produce - knowledge of keeping and cooking quality and taste rather than appearance - are not those of consumers in Europe, whose priorities are attractive visual appearance, consistent size and absence of blemishes. However, researching new varieties is only a beginning. The European consumer not only has considerable buying power but is also becoming increasingly selective. It is therefore essential that any country wishing to enter that market must ensure that there is a regular supply of consistently high quality produce in pre-determined quantities and at an agreed price. Planning for expansion While there is an urgent need to find new varieties, and even new crops, it is essential that due care is taken not to introduce diseases or pests during transfer of seed or vegetative planting materials. Quarantine regulations must be applied and both exporting and importing countries, as well as farmers, must take responsibility for ensuring exchange of clean planting materials. Pineapple nematodes were accidentally introduced into Ghana when growers embarked on an accelerated programme of planting improved varieties developed elsewhere in the region. Tissue culture, or aerial root propagating material, would have avoided this problem but there are no facilities for tissue culture in Ghana as yet. Sites for new plantations must be chosen with care. Mango plantations, for example, should not be established in humid zones where disease will always remain a problem. And for export crops, the distance between farm and port of exit should not be more than 100 km in order to avoid long haulage and the inevitable bruising that results. Increasingly, crops will have to be grown with very strict control over pesticide usage, especially just before or after harvest. With consumer pressure to reduce pesticide residues in food commodities and the tightening of EC laws concerning residues, alternatives to existing spraying regimes and post-harvest treatments must be developed: for example integrated pest management systems incorporating cultural and biological control measures. In the whole chain of production from grower to consumer {{one of the most critical}} links to protect quality is post-harvest storage. For tropical and sub-tropical produce the use of chilling facilities to remove field-heat and to maintain low temperatures during storage and transport is essential. However, the temperatures involved are critical and without reliable equipment and power supplies and well trained staff, all the investment in production may be lost between field or orchard and the supermarket shelf. Nearly every exporter in Zimbabwe has on-farm coldstore facilities to remove field-heat by pre-cooling and storing at the optimum temperature to prevent physiological deterioration. And there has been heavy investment in insulated trucks and cold stores at the airport for holding produce in transit. Multiple retailers (supermarkets) are expanding their share of the retail market throughout the EC and in the UK they now represent 50 % of retail distribution. The demands set by the multiples on their suppliers are high, not only in terms of quality of the product, but also on reliability of supply, volume and delivery schedule. They also expect standards of hygiene adopted by food processing industries and, where fruit or vegetables are being pre-packed, it is essential that the packhouse environment, workers' clothing and hands and any water used for washing all meet the highest standards of public health. Wherever air cargo capacity is available and prices are competitive, airfreight will be preferred for exporting perishable produce. However exporters should target only those countries served by direct flights; when consignments are trans-shipped onto a second flight they are inevitably subjected to a 3 - 5 hour period on the tarmac awaiting loading. In addition, the 'last-on' port of any cargo is vulnerable to last-minute offloads and trans-shipped consignments are the least likely to be put into coldstore facilities at an intermediate airport. Seafreight is a lower cost alternative for less perishable products but again temperature, and even the gases in the atmosphere, have to be controlled. Packaging must also be stronger in order to survive longer journey times, dockside trans-shipments and road or rail distribution on arrival in Europe. Finally, exporters should be aware of changes in packaging regulations in EC member countries. For instance, suppliers to Germany must use only standard pallets and these must be recyclable wherever possible. Where non-returnable pallets are used, they may be made only of untreated wood. Packaging must not include a mix of paper and plastic nor should toxic inks be used. Similar regulations are likely to be implemented throughout the EC. Worth the trouble? Competition is fierce and the standards demanded are high. It will not be easy for ACP countries to maintain, let alone increase, their share of fruit and vegetable exports to Europe. It may also appear easier for large-scale producers to manage production, storage, transport and marketing rather than farmers on smaller acreages. However, the rewards for successful exporters will be a share of a still-expanding market and foreign exchange to make up for reduced income from more traditional exported commodities, many of which are now in over-supply. Countries such as Kenya, Mauritius (see box) and Zimbabwe have also proved that a wide range of horticultural products can be grown to a high standard by small-scale growers: over 80 % of Kenyan producers are small-scale farmers who, with effective technical services provided by government and the private sector, are prepared to accept the challenge of producing for export. Government intervention and investment does not have to be on a large scale but it must be targeted to critical areas. It can be most effective where it plays a regulatory role and facilitates growth through horticultural research, infrastructural development, incentives and support services. In addition, the EC Commission encourages joint research projects and fosters links between ACP States and between ACP States and other countries. In the past new export crops such as fruit and vegetables have often been considered by policy makers to be less important than food crops and traditional export commodities. Now it seems that the rewards for successful trading in fresh produce may be more attractive. But exporting is a team effort and government policy-makers, research scientists, commercial exporters and farmers must be prepared to work together. If serious attention can be given to market research, varietal development, coldstorage facilities, transport, flexibility and marketing promotion, ACP countries have much to gain. African and Caribbean countries pioneered the export of fresh tropical fruits and <b>out-of-season</b> <b>vegetables</b> to Europe 30 years' ego but they have since lost a substantial share of the market to new exporters from Latin America and Asia.
