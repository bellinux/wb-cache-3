40|$|This work aims {{to provide}} an {{introduction}} to food regulation and enforcement systems in Portugal, especially regarding the Portuguese country profile and organization of the competent authorities in the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs,</b> particularly the Food Safety and Economic Authority. This is a law enforcement body with police powers, responsible for the inspection of economic activity and the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs,</b> ensures risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. It also {{provides an overview of}} the food fraud framework in Europe and Portugal, considering the powers of the Portuguese Authorities and the measures to combat food fraud. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Glucosamine {{is used as}} {{medicinal}} product to treat arthrosis of the knee joints. Yet glucosamine is also provided in numerous food supplements that are also considered foodstuffs in intake amounts that are below medicinal dosages. The German authorities for the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> are responsible for controlling the marketability of these substances. BfR has already assessed the health risks associated with glucosamine in food supplements in a past Opinion and identified three risk groups: a) diabetics and/or individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, b) patients with a known risk for cardiovascular diseases and c) persons who take certain blood coagulation inhibitors known as coumarin anticoagulants. In the present Opinion, BfR has once again assessed the health risk for risk groups b) and c). This was carried out because these risk groups were not identified as such in a recent Opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{on the use of}} glucosamine as food ingredient. A repeated assessment has led BfR to continue to classify individuals who take coumarin anticoagulants as belonging to a risk group. For daily intake amounts of 390 - 790 milligrams of isolated glucosamine in food supplements, BfR deems measures that protect individuals who take coumarin anticoagulants necessary. The Institute advises consumers who take such medication (coumarin anticoagulants) to abstain from consuming food supplements that contain said amounts of isolated glucosamine as daily rations...|$|E
40|$|Zoonoses are {{infectious}} diseases {{that can be}} transmitted from animals to humans. Some of the more relevant causes of these {{infectious diseases}} include Salmonella and Campylobac-ter which can be transmitted by foods such as poultry or pork. Zoonoses are a worldwide problem. In 2009 an annual country-wide zoonoses and resistance monitoring plan com-menced in order to collect information regarding the extent of contamination of livestock and food with zoonotic agents in Germany. The legal basis {{of this is the}} general administrative regulation on zoonoses in the food chain (AVV Zoonosen Lebensmittelkette) of 18 July 2008. The AVV is based on Directive 2003 / 99 /EC on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents. According to this, EU Member States are obligated to collect, evaluate and publish data on the emergence of zoonoses and their agents as well as related antibiotic resistances in food, feed and live animals. The AVV Zoonosen Lebensmittelkette stipulates that data are collected by the federal Länder as part of the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and livestock according to a representative sam-pling scheme agreed upon by the Government and the Länder. The following BfR Opinion reports on the scientific assessment of the resistance monitoring analysis results in light of consumer health protection. Infections with zoonotic agents in humans may require to be treated with antibiotics. Fur-thermore, the resistance of intestinal bacteria and contaminants can be transmitted to other bacteria, which can potentially lead to illness in humans. Thus, the control of bacterial resis-tance to antibiotics is quite relevant for human and animal health. BfR has analysed the re-sistance of zoonotic agents and commensal bacteria as part of zoonoses monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Various {{chemical}} agents are {{used during the}} whole production chain of milk and dairy products. Production of feedingstuffs is accompanied with pesticide usage, which may remain in environment, thus are transported through feeding into animals, animal products and finally in human organism. Preparation procedure and storage conditions of feed also influence on milk safety {{in the sense of}} mycotoxins entering into the food chain. Chemical agents are, on daily basis, used on dairy farms either as detergents or disinfections. The residuals of cleaning agents might remain in milk if the cleaning agents and its dosage are not performed adequately. Besides already mentioned agents, a great influence in milk production can bee seen through veterinary drugs usage, particularly antibacterial drugs (mastitis). Proper application of drugs and by following legal recommendation, a by-reactions can be avoided such as allergic reaction in humans, development of resisting bacteria or even undesirable influence on starter cultures in dairy products manufacture. The maximum residue limits, monitoring plan as well as sampling procedures are set up within the harmonization of Croatian and European legislation, in order to provide <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> residues in <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> animal origin...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are {{a category of}} organic compounds. They occur as result of the incomplete combustion of organic metals (e. g. coal, fuel, tobacco) and can enter foodstuffs through the environment. Furthermore, foodstuffs can contain PAH {{as a result of}} certain manufacturing methods. Especially smoked and barbecued meat and fish products are affected thus. Some PAHs are highly likely to have a mutagenic and carcinogenic effect on humans and could potentially cause reproductive and prenatal developmental damage. Because of their longevity, adverse health effects and worldwide prevalence, PAHs are highly relevant harmful substances. In order to assess the PAH concentration in foodstuffs for the purpose <b>of</b> health <b>control,</b> benzo[a]pyrene has often been analysed as a marker representing the entire category of substances. In addition, maximum levels in foodstuffs were set only for benzo[a]pyrene. The EC Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain has proposed three models that could replace the use of benzo[a]pyrene as exclusive marker substance for the group of PAHs: Introduction of maximum levels 1) for each individual substance in the PAH 4 group, 2) for the sum of PAH 4 or 3) for benzo[a]pyrene and the sum of the PAH 4 group. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the safety level and the practical effectiveness of these three proposals for markers for the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> PAHs in <b>foodstuffs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lateral flow immuno assay {{test kits}} for {{determining}} the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON) in grain provide relatively simple, cheap and quick detection means, but are only useful if they provide reliable and accurate results. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of four different lateral flow immune assay test kits, being Reveal Q+ DON (Neogen), Donsensor (Unisensor), RidaQuick DON (R-Biopharm AG), and RosaFast DON (Charm Sciences Inc.). The performance was evaluated based on accuracy, repeatability, and toxin recovery of the test kits using three types of wheat sample material. These included samples spiked at three different DON concentrations, reference material with a DON concentration of 900 µg/kg, and naturally contaminated samples {{with a wide range}} of DON concentrations. Results revealed that, in general, Reveal Q+ and Donsensor were the most accurate methods, whereas the performances of RidaQuick and RosaFast were much lower. Mean toxin recovery and repeatability of Reveal Q+ and Donsensor complied with EC requirements for analytical methods used for <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> DON in <b>foodstuffs.</b> Reveal Q+ and Donsensor also showed high accuracy. RidaQuick and RosaFast showed lower performance, in particular recovery of RidaQuick was lowest. However, laboratory procedures for the latter two test kits were easier to follow. In particular, RidaQuick has the easiest testing procedure and can be applied on-site without technical skills. Future research could focus on a more in-depth evaluation of the performance of Reveal Q+ and Donsensor, also including evaluation of between laboratory reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|Melamine resins are {{polymers}} and {{consist of}} the starting substances (monomers) melamine and formaldehyde. The materials are hard and unbreakable, and for these material proper-ties {{they are used}} {{for the production of}} dishes and kitchen utensils. Consumer products made of melamine resins such as plates, cups, bowls or cutlery can re-lease melamine and formaldehyde if they are exposed to high temperatures above 70 ° C. Migration limits have been set for the migration of melamine and formaldehyde into foods. Testing by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) as well as test results of the com-petent Länder (regional) authorities for the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> reveals that the regu-latory migration limits for the migration of melamine and formaldehyde to food are exceeded at higher temperatures. This occurs especially at 100 °C, the boiling point of water. If kitchen utensils made of melamine resin are used for frying and cooking or the heating of foods in a microwave oven, amounts of melamine and formaldehyde which present a health risk can transfer into food. This is especially the case for acidic foods including many fruit and vegetable preparations. Furthermore, the health risk through inhalation of formaldehyde from kitchen utensils is possible, as the substance also distributes into the air. BfR thus maintains that consumers should avoid the use dishes and kitchen utensils made of mela-mine resins when frying or cooking or when heating foods in a microwave oven. If the products are used at temperatures up to 70 °C, they {{are not likely to be}} dangerous to human health. Such temperatures are reached, for example, when hot beverages or foods are filled into cups, bowls or onto plates. Products made of melamine are also safe for use as salad servers or cutlery...|$|E
40|$|The <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> of {{the federal}} state of Brandenburg has found {{residues}} of the pesticide formetanate {{in a sample of}} cucumbers from Spain at a level of 0. 13 mg/kg (maxi-mum residue level by law is 0. 05 mg/kg). The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has as-sessed whether the detected residue level is a health hazard for consumers. Based on various food consumption data, the Institute has estimated how much formetanate would be taken in by consumers through the consumption of cucumbers with this residue. The exposure assessment has shown that the acute reference dose (ARfD) for children is exceeded. The ARfD is defined as the amount of a substance in food which a consumer may ingest during one day (spread over one or several meals) without appreciable health risk. Yet, an exceedance of the acute reference dose on its own is not enough to conclude a health risk. In order to assess potential health risk, toxicologists rely on the margin of safety (MOS). The MOS indicates the margin between the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) obtained from animal experiments and the estimated amount of the substance taken in by consumers. In the case at hand, though the acute reference dose is exceeded, the margin of safety is wide enough so that the consumption of cucumbers with 0. 13 mg/kg formetanate residues is unlikely to be a health hazard – even for children. The estimation {{of the degree to which}} the acute reference dose is reached reveals whether a health hazard is possible. Yet even if the exhaustion of the complete reference dose does not constitute a health hazard, the product has to be removed from the market if maximum residue levels of pesticides have been exceeded...|$|E
40|$|Multi-groups and multi-residues {{test methods}} will be developed, for the {{purposes}} <b>of</b> the <b>official</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> pesticides in <b>foodstuffs</b> and vegetables. In particular, {{our goal is to}} develop 2 methods for animal derived products, 1 for vegetables and 1 for feeds. Animal derived foods will be {{selected on the basis of}} their fat content. The active compounds will be chosen according to the following criteria: - the matching matrix-pesticide indicated by the Regulation 1213 / 2008 /EC - the maximum residue limits (MRL) set by the Regulation 396 / 2005 /EC - the suggestions from the Community Reference Laboratories (CRLs) - the pesticides used in agriculture in Italy - the pesticides monitored within the IIZZSS network in the framework of the National Monitoring Plans for drug residues(PNR) and Feeds (PNAA The Regulation 1213 / 2008 /EC states to pay particular attention to the monitoring of organophosphates, carbamates, triazoles and pyretroids. The test methods will be developed according to the suggestions from the CRLs, above all considering recently introduced techniques for both sample treatment (extraction, purification) and determination of pesticides (LC-MS/MS and GCMS/ MS using triple quadrupole detectors). The methods will be: multi-group and multi-residue, able to determinate a lot of compounds exhibiting different chemical and physical properties, applicable to several matrices. During the first step of the project, a practical workshop organised by e CRL will be carried out, to transfer the scientific and technical know how already available. For sample treatment, the potency and relative merits of SPE, ASE, QUECHERS system will be tested for extraction and purification steps. This approach should also allow for reducing analysis time, costs and wastes of solvents. Test methods will be validated according to the SANCO/ 2007 / 3131 guideline from the Commission, integrated with the requirements of the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC and the Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, with particular reference to the case of feeds. Regarding speciation of mercury and its organic form, test methods will be developed for determination of methyl-mercury in seafood and feeds for aquaculture, based on LC-ICP/MS, LC-FIMS/AAS techniques. The methods will be validated according to the Regulation 882 / 2004 /EC. The ratio total mercury /methyl- mercury in some seafood will be evaluated. A model for risk evaluation, managing and communication will be studied to assess consumer#s exposure due to some seafood...|$|R

40|$|Experience {{learns that}} {{conventional}} pasteurization methods in pest <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff</b> (hot air, {{hot water and}} chemical methods) are not qualitatively and economically efficient. In some cases, these conventional pasteurization methods even {{turn out to be}} dangerous for human health. Because of its direct impact on dipoles of dielectric materials, its volumetric heating effect and minimal influence on the food quality, RF heating {{is one of the most}} promising methods in industrial pest <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>foodstuff.</b> In this research, first the temperature rise in the food and pest is studied analytically and is validated numerically using commercial software. These will be compared with experimental results. Then the important agriculture product, wheat flour is tested with RF pasteurization. A 1 kW dielectric heater at variable frequency (13. 56 MHz, 27. 12 MHz and 40. 68 MHz) has been designed, and implemented for this experiment. The samples are contaminated by Tribolium Confusum flour. The pestiferous wheat flour is heated at 13. 56 MHz in 10, 20, 30, 40, 45 and 60 seconds, at 27. 12 MHz in 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 60 seconds and at 40. 68 MHz in 5, 10, 20, 12, 15 and 60 seconds. status: publishe...|$|R
