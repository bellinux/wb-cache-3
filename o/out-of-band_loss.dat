40|$|This paper {{reports on}} micromachined tunable bandstop filters that exhibit an octave {{frequency}} tuning range with high stopband rejection and low <b>out-of-band</b> <b>loss.</b> In addition to continuous frequency tuning, stopband switch on-off capability is realized by employing ohmic switches along with tunable capacitors. The fully re-configurable filters {{in this work}} are fabricated using a silicon-based integrated passive device technology and are the smallest-size bandstop filters reported in the low SHF range...|$|E
40|$|A new double-layer grating {{template}} {{is designed}} to reduce the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>loss</b> as much as 1. 8 dB when the loss of LP 03 reaches 10. 2 dB. Meanwhile, we propose a method to remove the sidelobes in the transmission spectra by the adjustment of the thickness of pressure plates. The plate-thickness-induced shift of resonant wavelength and the attenuation of loss peak intensity when removing sidelobes can be modified by the fibre distance and contact point on the pressure plates...|$|E
40|$|High-power fiber lasers {{have reached}} kW power levels. The most {{important}} non-linear process limiting power scaling of industrial fiber lasers is stimulated Raman scattering. Long period gratings (LPGs) couple forward propagating core light to forward propagating cladding light and are well suited as a filter for the unwanted Raman scattering. In this paper we {{show for the}} first time of our knowledge the inscription of LPGs in large-mode-area (LMA) fibers with ultra-short laser pulses. We investigate the influence of different inscription parameters with a 3 D, spatially resolved measurement of the induced index change. We present results from gratings with an attenuation of 8. 5 dB at the desired wavelength with a small <b>out-of-band</b> <b>loss</b> of 1 dB...|$|E
40|$|A theory, {{based on}} {{material}} parameters, is developed for colloidal-crystal Bragg filters. The coupling constant, for coupled-wave equations, is derived to produce filter spectra. The spectra are modified by convolving with a Gaussian function to represent crystal defects. Scattering losses are calculated to attenuate the out-of-band transmission. The theory is tested by comparing theoretical spectra with experimental spectra from colloidal-crystal Bragg filters fabricated with polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) colloid spheres. A novel cell, for containing the colloidal crystal, {{is presented in}} addition to crystal growing techniques. Coupled-wave theory spectra are compared with experimental filter spectra for filters with variable colloid sphere diameters, filter thicknesses, liquid refractive indices, and Bragg wavelengths. Spectral comparisons {{are based on the}} notch bandwidth, optical density, and <b>out-of-band</b> scattering <b>losses.</b> The bandwidths agree to within one nanometer provided the criteria for the Rayleigh-Gans scattering approximation are satisfied. The optical densities correlate with spectrophotometer-measured optical densities. And, scattering losses correspond to within 10 percent for all material parameters. Thus, the coupled-wave theory is consistent with the data and provides an excellent tool for evaluating colloidal-crystal Bragg filter performance...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{we present}} RF MEMS filters which address the most {{challenging}} performance requirements of modern RF front-end systems, namely multi-band processing capability, low energy consumption, and small size. These filters not only provide a wide tuning range for multiple-band selection, but also offer low loss, high power handling capability, fast tuning speed, and temperature stability. Two different technologies are considered for tunable lumped element filter targeting UHF range. The first technology is a tunable RF MEMS platform based on surface micromachining, enabling fabrication of continuously tuned capacitors, capacitive and ohmic switches, as well as high-Q inductors, all on a single chip. The filter is in a third-order coupled resonator configuration. Continuous electrostatic tuning is achieved using three tunable capacitor banks each consisting of one continuously tunable capacitor and three switched capacitors with pull-in voltage of less than 40 V. The center frequency of the filter is tuned from 1 GHz to 600 MHz while maintaining a 3 dB-bandwidth of 13 to 14 % and insertion loss of 2 %. The filter occupies a small size (1. 5 cm x 1. 0 cm). This filter shows the best published performance yet in terms of insertion <b>loss,</b> <b>out-of-band</b> rejection, temperature stability, and tuning range. The second technology {{is based on a}} new tuning mechanism utilizing phase-change (PC) materials. PC technology has been investigated and adopted in memory industry due to its fast transition time in nano second range, small size, and high resistance change ratio. Although PC materials offer several benefits, they have not been considered for RF applications because of their limited power handling capability and relatively higher on-resistance in their current form. In this work, germanium tellurium (GeTe) is considered as it offers a low on-resistivity and pronounced resistance change ratio of up to 106. To characterize RF properties of GeTe, different types of RF switches have been fabricated and compared. Such PC switches can be monolithically integrated with other micromachined components to implement reconfigurable front-end modules, potentially offering high tuning speed, low loss, high linearity, and small size...|$|R
40|$|At the NASA Lewis Research Center, {{ferroelectric}} films, such as SrTiO 3 and Ba(x) Sr(1 -x) TiO 3, {{are being}} {{used in conjunction with}} YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) high-temperature superconducting (HTS) thin films to fabricate tunable microwave components, such as filters, varactors, and local oscillators. These structures capitalize on the variation of the dielectric constant of the ferroelectric film upon the application of a dc electric field {{as well as on the}} low microwave losses exhibited by the high-temperature superconducting films relative to their conventional conductor counterparts. (For example, the surface resistance for a YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) thin film at 10 GHz and 77 K is more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of copper at the same frequency and temperature.) SrTiO 3 and Ba(x) Sr(1 -x) TiO 3 films are used because their crystal structure and lattice parameters are similar to those of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta), thus enabling the growth of highly textured YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) films with high critical current densities on the underlying ferroelectric film, or alternatively, of highly textured ferroelectric film on the underlying YBa 2 Cu 3 O(7 -delta) film. Our efforts have been concentrated so far in determining the deposition parameters required for optimal ferroelectric thin-film growth (i. e., maximum tunability and lowest loss) and in investigating different varactor configurations to determine which geometry is the most advantageous in terms of tunability, losses, and required bias for a given communication application. For example, we have observed that for optimized SrTiO 3 films in a parallel plate capacitor, tunabilities of up to 47 percent and dissipation losses (tan d) of 0. 05 are attainable at 1 MHz, 80 K, and within the 0 - to 5 -V bias range. In contrast, for an interdigital configuration, tunabilities of up to 70 percent and tan d ranging from 0. 015 to 0. 001 (depending on bias) have been observed at 1 MHz and 77 K within the 0 - to 100 -V bias range. Efforts are underway to use these results in developing tunable receiver front-end preselect filters as well as in low-phase noise, tunable local oscillators for K-band applications. These components represent a hitherto unavailable technology to meet the stringent performance requirements of foreseeable satellite and wireless communication systems (e. g., bandwidth, in-band insertion <b>losses,</b> <b>out-of-band</b> rejection, and noise, amongst others) in a more advantageous fashion than with currently available technology (e. g., dielectric-filled cavity and waveguide filters, and dielectric resonator oscillators). Prototypes of high-temperature superconducting/ferroelectric tunable components such as a low-phase noise K-band local oscillator, a preselect C-band filter, and a low-loss K-band phase shifter are under development at NASA Lewis...|$|R
