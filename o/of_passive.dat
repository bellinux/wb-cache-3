5|$|The common {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>passive</b> solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} <b>of</b> <b>passive</b> solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
40|$|Counter to {{findings}} in English, German and Hebrew, recent acquisition {{studies have shown}} that passive is acquired early in several non-Indo-European languages. In an attempt to explain this phenomenon, this paper addresses certain typological phenomena which influence the early acquisition <b>of</b> <b>passives</b> in Sesotho, a southern Bantu language. After outlining the structure <b>of</b> the Sesotho <b>passive</b> and its syntactic and discourse functions, I examine Sesotho speaking children's spontaneous use <b>of</b> <b>passives,</b> showing that the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>passives</b> in Sesotho is closely linked to the fact that Sesotho subjects must be discourse topics.

5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part of {{everyday}} life and culture in occupied Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling the actions of the official Belgian government in peacetime.

5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length <b>of</b> <b>passive</b> components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Muslim conquests, the Byzantine Empire, as the largest, richest and militarily strongest state bordering the expanding Caliphate, had been the Muslims' primary enemy. Following the disastrous Battle of Sebastopolis, the Byzantines had largely confined themselves to a strategy <b>of</b> <b>passive</b> defence, while the Muslim armies regularly launched raids into Byzantine-held Anatolia. Following their failure to capture the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, in 717–718, the Umayyads for a time diverted their attention elsewhere. From 720/721, however, they resumed these expeditions in a regular pattern: each summer one or two campaigns (pl. ṣawā'if, sing. ṣā'ifa) would be launched, sometimes accompanied by a naval attack and sometimes followed by winter expeditions (shawātī). These were no longer aimed at permanent conquest but rather large-scale raids, plundering and devastating the countryside and only occasionally attacking forts or major settlements. The raids of this period were also largely confined to the central Anatolian plateau (chiefly its eastern half, Cappadocia), and only rarely reached the peripheral coastlands.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations.

40|$|International audienceImpersonal <b>passives</b> are <b>passives</b> <b>of</b> intransitive verbs. Applying passivisation to an intransitive verb {{results in}} a derived verb-form with no {{referential}} argument; the surface subject of the construction is then either absent or realised by an expletive subject. Consequently, the analysis <b>of</b> impersonal <b>passives</b> inherits the complexities {{of at least three}} related domains: (i) the cross-linguistic definition <b>of</b> <b>passives</b> in general, (ii) the analysis of subjectless sentences and (iii) the syntax of sentences withexpletive subjects. The first section reviews the most influential characterisations <b>of</b> <b>passives</b> in the literature in terms of subject demotion and object promotion. The analyses <b>of</b> impersonal <b>passives</b> in the literature will be presented against this general backdrop. The second section presents evidence that subject demotion does not yield a uniform class <b>of</b> <b>passives</b> based on the literature on Romance, Celtic, Slavic and Germanic. In particular, constructions that suppress the logical subject differ in whether they yield a syntactically transitive or intransitive output when applied to a transitive verb. Based on this observation, {{it has been argued that}} constructions that suppress the subject but do not de-transitivise the underlying verb should not be analysed as passives; instead these constructions should be treated as impersonal verb forms, more similar to transitive sentences with an overt impersonal subject such as Engl. one, French on, Germanic man/men than to passives. Arguably, this distinction between valency reducing passives and valency-preserving impersonals is preserved when the relevant constructions are applied to intransitive verbs. The final section examines the question what role overt expletives play in the syntax <b>of</b> impersonal <b>passives.</b> The literature on expletives constructions in Germanic and particularly in Scandinavian provides a wealth of data that will be used to place the overt expletive subject found with impersonal passives in the context of expletive constructions more generally...|$|R

5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest <b>of</b> <b>passive</b> circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
