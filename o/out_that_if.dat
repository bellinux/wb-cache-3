5|$|Coutances {{returned}} to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure {{compensation for the}} losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that {{the conditions of the}} treaty would be fulfilled. Part of the treaty laid <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at three o’clock in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation, {{and ordered}} the military to control the crowd and enforce {{the resolution of the}} previous day. The commanders pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they did so, their soldiers would mutiny. As the demonstration overran some sections of the cabildo, Cisneros' resignation was finally accepted. The members of the new Junta were the result of a document with hundreds of signatures, drafted among the people in the plaza. Cornelio Saavedra was the president of this Junta. He rejected this at first, fearing that he may be suspected of promoting the revolution for personal interest, but finally accepted at Cisneros' request. As the Junta was established on May 25, the other cities were invited to send deputies to a constituent assembly to discuss the type of government; on May 27, they were invited to send deputies to join the Junta. Both invitations were contradictory, but the consequences would take place some months later.|$|E

25|$|Others {{dispute the}} {{importance}} of consumption over income, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn {{it is because they}} are saving less or going deeper into debt. Income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle.|$|E

Dick's favour with Richard Crookback allows him to plead {{successfully}} for his life after the Battle of Shoreby, but this in turn causes Dick to fall out of favour with Crookback. Arblaster, untouched by his kindness, bitterly points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> not for Dick stealing his ship, he would not need to be saved in the first place. He ends life as a pensioner in Tunstall Hamlet.|$|E

25|$|During {{the trial}} of David Westerfield in 2002 for the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, Grace made it clear on Larry King Live that {{she thought he was}} guilty, but she got some facts wrong. For example, she said he had steam-cleaned his RV, but no {{evidence}} was introduced that he had. Dr. Henry Lee pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain on the carpet. It should be noted, however, that David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam.|$|E
25|$|Though he knew {{repealing}} the laws {{would mean the}} end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Peel were convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.|$|E
