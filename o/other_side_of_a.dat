5|$|The first Japanese {{mainstream}} {{film with}} nudity was Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, (1964), and Takechi {{made the first}} big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream(白日夢), the same year. Like Women... Oh, Women!, Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office. After being drugged, the artist watches helplessly from the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window as the dentist tortures and performs a series of sexual acts on a female patient.|$|E
5|$|With Klim {{recently}} {{returning from}} a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4×100m freestyle relay. The 200m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1min 44.71s. Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4×200m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin {{but was unable to}} pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13s earlier. Thorpe found himself on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> close result when he qualified last for the 100m freestyle by 0.01s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history. After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Australians were {{detected}} while waiting to step off and, after being illuminated by flares and taking fire from a German picquet, hastily launched the attack. After overcoming this, the left-centre company, having lost {{all of their}} officers, lost their formation {{and had to be}} re-organised before the attack on {{the eastern side of the}} village could continue. The two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance. The left-most company then began its task of establishing outposts to the east. At the same time, on the right, the right-most company had advanced to the Doignes–Hermies road when they had begun to take fire. Overcoming this and skirting a wire obstacle, they began moving towards the rear of the German main defence line. At this point, they came under fire from a low hill on the western outskirts of the village, which took them in the flank and pinned them on its slope. In the darkness, the location of the enemy machine-gun could not be ascertained initially. The Australians remained fixed there for almost an hour-and-a-half before members of the right centre company, who had avoided most of the German resistance, were able to locate it and destroy it from the rear just before dawn. The two centre companies were then able to enter the village proper, forcing large numbers of the garrison to try to escape to the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in large numbers. Here the left-most company had been establishing a number of posts in the open fields. Most of these were established with minimal resistance, however, one platoon became heavily engaged by a machine-gun positioned near a sandpit on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> road. A small group of men crossed the road and attempted to provide covering fire for the platoon. Amongst this group was Private Bede Kenny who, under heavy fire, rushed the enemy position and destroyed it with grenades, taking the surviving Germans prisoner. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Minor skirmishing continued after this, but by 6:00am the village had been captured and 200 prisoners taken, for a loss to the 2nd Battalion of eight officers and 173 other ranks killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|Thompson commandeered the {{government}} brig, {{which was in}} Nelson at the time. On the morning of 17 June the party, its size swelled to between 49 and 60 men, including chief surveyor Frederick Tuckett and others who had joined the party after landing, approached the Māori camp. The New Zealand Company's storekeeper James Howard issued the British men with cutlasses, bayonets, pistols and muskets. At the path on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream, Te Rauparaha stood surrounded by about 90 warriors, {{as well as by}} women and children.

Claverías entrusted its capture to Captain Gregorio Bárcenas and his carabineer company of the 2nd Light Regiment. Only one Moro {{was wounded in the}} assault, compared to no Spanish casualties. The Spaniards took 93 artillery pieces at the two forts, most of them bronze cannons. Thirteen others were found in nearby houses. The Spanish losses had been considerable: 16 killed, 124 wounded and 22 bruised. Captain José María Ataide, of the 1st Light Regiment, was killed, and Clavería's two adjutants were wounded along with other officers. 340 corpses of dead pirates were bunched together and burned to avoid disease.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox synagogues, {{the dancing}} is mainly {{carried out by}} men and boys; {{children}} (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers.

In 2014, an Israeli modern Orthodox rabbinical organization called Beit Hillel ruled that women are permitted to dance with a Torah scroll on Simchat Torah. They also recommended in their ruling designating a woman as the kallah Torah, or bride of the Torah, just as a man is designated as the chatan Torah, or groom of the Torah, and making sure there is enough dance space for the women, as well as consulting with the women on the songs that will be sung.|$|E

25|$|The stadium's {{structure}} and facilities {{have gone through}} many changes since it first opened in 1896. The ground originally comprised a football pitch surrounded by an oval cycling track; a main stand was on the pitch's southern side, with a smaller stand opposite. Both stands were terraced. A larger stand, built on the northern side of the pitch in the early 1920s, is still in use, and is considered a landmark building by the city municipality—modifications to it are therefore illegal. A larger, improved Southern Stand was built in 1931, the same year of the tennis hall's construction. The tennis hall was built {{as part of the}} same plot, but it now stands on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> road that was built through the grounds in 1945. The Northern Stand originally had a restaurant behind it and a large hall next to it, but these were knocked down in 1944 {{to make room for the}} Malmö Opera and Music Theatre.|$|E

500|$|According to neo-Darwinism, adaptations are {{produced}} incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations {{only if they}} do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: [...] "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [...] the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable." [...] In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable [...] "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that [...] "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".|$|E
500|$|... 12 Troop entered Mozambique on 31 July 1968 and {{contacted}} the enemy around noon, when Strong heard voices ahead and ordered his men {{out for a}} sweep. The guerrillas, encamped under trees on a slightly higher position on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dry riverbed, opened fire, wounding an RLI trooper. Strong called on the insurgents to surrender, to which they responded with obscenities and anti-white racist slogans before resuming fire. 12 Troop took cover and tossed phosphorus grenades to mask their advance; {{the men on the}} left rushed up the slope beneath the smoke and positioned themselves to the cadres' right. Under attack from the front and the right flank, the ZIPRA fighters soon fled, leaving seven dead and one wounded. Petter-Bowyer and the helicopters now arrived to give air support and wounded two insurgents, who took cover in a small, naturally formed tunnel. Lance-Corporal Lahee and one other man chased them to the tunnel and captured them. Of the remaining five guerrillas, four were killed and one captured. The focus now moved to the other group of cadres being chased south by Pearce's men.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Dickinson's {{behavior}} {{began to}} change. She {{did not leave}} the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> door rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person. Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding {{that she was not}} to be a subject of discussion with outsiders. Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that [...] "Aunt Emily stood for indulgence." [...] MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called [...] "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.|$|E
