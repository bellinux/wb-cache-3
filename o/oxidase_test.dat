40|$|The {{mutualisation}} of analytical platforms {{might be}} used to address rising healthcare costs. Our study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of networking a unique matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system for common use in several university hospitals in Brussels, Belgium. During a one-month period, 1, 055 successive bacterial isolates from the Brugmann University Hospital were identified on-site using conventional techniques; these same isolates were also identified using a MALDI-TOF MS system at the Porte de Hal Laboratory by sending target plates and identification projects via transportation and the INFECTIO-MALDI software (Infopartner, Nancy, France), respectively. The occurrence of transmission problems (< 2 %) and human errors (< 1 %) suggested that the system was sufficiently robust to be implemented in a network. With a median time-to-identification of 5 h and 11 min (78 min, min-max: 154 - 547), MALDI-TOF MS networking always provided a faster identification result than conventional techniques, except when chromogenic culture media and <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests</b> were used (p< 0. 0001). However, the limited clinical benefits of the chromogenic culture media do not support their extra cost. Our financial analysis also suggested that MALDI-TOF MS networking could lead to substantial annual cost savings. MALDI-TOF MS networking presents many advantages, and few conventional techniques (optochin and <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests)</b> are required to ensure the same quality in patient care from the distant laboratory. Nevertheless, such networking should not be considered unless there is a reorganisation of workflow, efficient communication between teams, qualified technologists and a reliable IT department and helpdesk to manage potential connectivity problems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

30|$|In {{breadmaking}} industry, POx {{performs a}} role similar to glucose oxidase: by introducing disulfide bonds into gluten proteins, it improves the dough strength, rheology, stability, and bread loaf volume (Decamps et al. 2012 a, b). With the increasing evidence that POx {{could be used}} to improve bread dough stability, it is noticed that many pyranose <b>oxidases</b> <b>tested</b> in breadmaking are limited to those from Trametes multicolor (Decamps et al. 2012 a, 2013, 2014). In another aspect, although there have been achievements in engineering POx for better thermostability and catalytic efficiency (Bastian et al. 2005; Heckmann-Pohl et al. 2006; Masuda-Nishimura et al. 1999), it is not known how the mutations would affect the behavior of the pyranose oxidase in breadmaking.|$|R
40|$|A new selective, {{differential}} plating {{medium to}} screen the common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens is described. The medium combines adonitol fermentation, phenylalanine deaminase, and beta-glucuronidase tests {{and allows the}} indole and cytochrome <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests</b> to be performed directly from the plates. High-level agreement with individual conventional tests was recorded in comparative studies with 504 cultures of gram-negative rods. There was 100 % agreement, except for the Providencia spp. indole spot test (61. 6 % agreement). Adonitol fermentation by Providencia species could not be determined. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified with a high efficiency (100, 85. 7, 83. 5, and 100 % agreement, respectively) without further testing.

30|$|All {{clinical}} and environment samples were processed within 2  h of collection for identification of Gram-negative bacteria. Isolates were recovered on blood agar after incubating at 35 – 37  °C for 24 – 48  h. Then, single colonies were sub-cultured on MacConkey agar and incubated at 35 – 37  °C for 24 – 48  h. Isolates were presumptively identified based on colony morphology, Gram-staining properties and biochemical characteristics [oxidase, triple sugar iron (TSI), sulphur indole and motility (SIM), citrate, and urease tests]. Colonial morphological features (i.e. colonies with characteristic spreading pattern and serrated edges, fruity sweet-grape smell, and bright green color) {{were used to}} identify Pseudomonas isolates. Positive catalase and <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests,</b> negative TSI and glucose fermentation tests and growth at 42  °C were used to distinguish P. aeruginosa from other lactose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods.

40|$|Two {{brands of}} thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar and Monsur taurocholate {{tellurite}} gelatin (TTG) agar {{were compared with}} two newly developed media, sucrose tellurite teepol agar and Vibrio parahaemolyticus agar for isolation and identification of Vibrio cholerae. The thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose and TTG agars were the best selective media, whereas sucrose tellurite teepol agar was the poorest. Both TTG and sucrose tellurite teepol agars were good for use in follow-up serological tests, whereas only TTG agar {{could be used for}} follow-up <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests.</b> In our opinion TTG agar has more advantages for cholera research laboratories routinely culturing large numbers of patients for cholera on a daily basis and where media needs can be accurately predicted. In contrast, in smaller clinical laboratories or in laboratories investigating epidemics, thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar is best because it is commercially available and easy to prepare and can be used to distinguish colonies of suspect V. cholerae from V. parahaemolyticus...|$|R
40|$|The {{culture of}} Helicobacter pylori from a gastric biopsy is the “gold standard” in the {{diagnosis}} of H. pylori infection. However, the primary isolation of H. pylori from gastric biopsies is rather demanding. The duration of incubation for the isolation of H. pylori has been recommended to be five to seven days: in the present case, we found that a prolonged incubation period allowed the successful isolation of H. pylori from a patient with ulcus ventriculi. Biopsies were placed directly into transport medium and processed for culture within two hours. On day 14, one suspected H. pylori-like colony appeared {{on one of the}} plates. The isolate was confirmed to be H. pylori based on its typical colony morphology, negative Gram stain, and positive urease, catalase and <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests.</b> The isolate, requiring 14 days recovery, later exhibited the normal growth characteristics of H. pylori strains, indicating its unusually long incubation requirement was a temporary predicament...|$|R
50|$|Before {{starting}} a test, one must confirm {{the culture is}} of an Enterobacteriaceae. To test this, a quick <b>oxidase</b> <b>test</b> for cytochrome c oxidase is performed. Enterobacteriaceae are typically oxidase negative, meaning they either do not use oxygen as an electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, or they use a different cytochrome enzyme for transferring electrons to oxygen. If the culture is determined to be oxidase positive, alternative tests {{must be carried out}} to correctly identify the bacterial species.|$|E
50|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{that tend to}} be associated with Pseudomonas species (with some exceptions) include secretion of pyoverdine, a fluorescent yellow-green siderophore under iron-limiting conditions.

Pseudomonas species also typically give a positive result to the <b>oxidase</b> <b>test,</b> the absence of gas formation from glucose, glucose is oxidised in oxidation/fermentation test using Hugh and Leifson O/F test, beta hemolytic (on blood agar), indole negative, methyl red negative, Voges-Proskauer test negative, and citrate positive.|$|E
50|$|Bacteria of this genus lack flagella, whip-like {{structures}} many bacteria use for locomotion, but exhibit twitching or swarming motility. This {{may be due}} to {{the activity}} of type IV pili, pole-like structures that can be extended and retracted. Motility in A. baumannii may also be due to the excretion of exopolysaccharide, creating a film of high-molecular-weight sugar chains behind the bacterium to move forward. Clinical microbiologists typically differentiate members of the Acinetobacter genus from other Moraxellaceae by performing an <b>oxidase</b> <b>test,</b> as Acinetobacter spp. are the only members of the Moraxellaceae to lack cytochrome c oxidases.|$|E
30|$|Bacteria {{capable of}} {{producing}} different extracellular enzymes of potential relevance in digestive processes were isolated from the stomach, hepatopancreas and intestine of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. A total of 64 strains with proteolytic activity were isolated and grouped into 16 clusters based on morphological characteristics: 4 groups were isolated from the intestine; 5 from the hepatopancreas; and 7 from the stomach. Molecular methods (16 S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing) and phenotypic criteria (Gram stain, catalase and <b>oxidase</b> <b>tests,</b> cell and colony morphology) were used to identify strains, which corresponded to Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio genera. These genera are reported to form part of the digestive tract microbial community in shrimp. Both genera were isolated from all three tested tissues. One member of each morphologic group was selected for analysis {{of the presence of}} amylases, lipases/esterases and chitinases. Most of the strains had all the tested enzymes, indicating that the L. vannamei digestive tract microbiotic flora includes groups which have the potential to contribute to the degradation of dietary components.|$|R
