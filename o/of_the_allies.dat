5000|$|Article 18 [...] "An Allied Control Commission will be {{established}} which will undertake until <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> peace <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> {{and control over}} <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present terms under the general direction and orders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> (Soviet) High Command, acting on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> Powers". In <b>the</b> Annex to Article 18, it was made clear that [...] "The Romanian Government and their organs shall fulfill all instructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> Control Commission arising out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armistice Agreement." [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> Control Commission would have its seat in Bucharest.|$|R
5|$|This {{was because}} the {{situation}} began to change in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> They had landed in North Africa while the Soviets were undertaking their great winter offensive, endangering, and eventually defeating, the German 6th Army around Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Greece, like Bulgaria, {{initially}} maintained neutrality {{during the}} conflict. The Greek leadership was {{divided between the}} Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who supported Great Britain on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> and King Constantine who was educated in Germany and married to the Kaiser's sister. The king admired Prussian militarism and was anticipating a quick German victory. The king wanted Greece to remain neutral in the conflict, a strategy favorable to Germany and the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{had nearly}} surpassed his friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt's score of 59 {{victories}} in just five weeks. However, the massive material superiority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> meant the strain {{placed on the}} outnumbered German pilots was now severe. At this time, the strength of German fighter units was 112 (65 serviceable) aircraft against the British muster of some 800 machines.|$|E

50|$|In 1944 - Around <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> leaders' {{meeting at}} Droxford, a {{proposal}} {{was made for}} the USATC to build a branch from Droxford to Southwick House. <b>The</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> invasion <b>of</b> Europe in 1944 meant that this plan was never carried out.|$|R

5|$|On behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> Austria {{agreed to}} send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when it became {{apparent}} that Murat corresponded with Napoleon I, which was explicitly forbidden by a recent treaty. Murat never actually wrote to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, forged the correspondence, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25million francs.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> {{changed with}} receipt of the detailed, 32-page Vrba–Wetzler report, compiled by two Jewish prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfréd Wetzler, who escaped on 7 April 1944. This report finally convinced Allied leaders that mass killings {{were taking place}} in Auschwitz.|$|E

5|$|The {{course of}} events {{paved the way for}} Venizelos to return to Athens on 29 May 1917. Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> The entire Greek army was mobilized (though {{tensions}} remained inside the army between supporters of the Constantine and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> and ending the battle for the island.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognized Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they stood by and followed the relations between Finland and Germany, the main enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> which hoped to override Lenin's regime and get Russia back into the war against the Germans. As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened it, in order to get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.|$|E

5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee {{the security of the}} Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking {{a turning point in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Following the Noemvriana, the Allies, {{determined}} to remove Constantine I, established a naval blockade to isolate areas which supported the king. After {{the resignation of}} the king on 15 June 1917, Greece unified under a new king, Alexander, Constantine I's son, and the leadership of Eleftherios Venizelos. It joined World War I on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> By 1918, the mobilized Greek army provided the numerical superiority the Allies needed on the Macedonian front. The Allied army shortly thereafter defeated the Central Powers forces in the Balkans, followed by the liberation of Serbia and the conclusion of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command. Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine {{that there was not}} a single U-boat in the vicinity of Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia. They claimed instead that the British had torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b>|$|E

5|$|German {{casualty}} {{figures are}} less complete than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies,</b> and official figures {{have never been}} released. A signal possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September listed 3,300 casualties (1,300 killed and 2,000 injured) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek. Robert Kershaw's assessment of the incomplete records identified at least 2,500 casualties. In the Roll of Honour: Battle of Arnhem 17–26 September 1944, J.A. Hey of the Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum, Oosterbeek identified 1,725 German dead from the Arnhem area relating {{to the time of}} the battle. All of these figures are significantly higher than Model's conservative estimate of 3,300 casualties for the entire Market Garden area of battle (which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen).|$|E
5|$|In July, George Washington sailed from New York to the Panama Canal, thence to Los Angeles and Brisbane, Australia. Returning to Los Angeles, she sailed {{again in}} September to Bombay and Cape Town, {{and arrived at}} New York to {{complete}} her round-the-world voyage in December 1943. In January 1944 George Washington began regular service to the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean, again carrying troops in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> in Europe from.

5|$|In early April 1945, Lützow joined Galland's Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th Fighter Detachment) at Munich-Riem. JV44 was {{equipped}} with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, an aircraft which was heavily armed and faster than any Allied fighter. Galland hoped that the Me262 would compensate for the numerical superiority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> Lützow had been released from his position as fighter leader in Italy and Galland appointed him as his adjutant. Lützow was credited with two aerial victories flying the Me262.|$|E
