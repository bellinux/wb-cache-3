6000|$|Susan Shepherd's {{word for}} her, again and again, {{was that she}} was [...] "large"; yet it was not exactly a case, as to the soul, of echoing chambers: she might have been likened rather to a capacious receptacle, {{originally}} perhaps loose, but now drawn as tightly as possible over its accumulated contents--a packed mass, for her American admirer, of curious detail. When the latter good lady, at home, had handsomely figured her friends as not small--which was the way she mostly figured them--there was a certain implication that they were spacious because they were empty. Mrs. Lowder, by a different law, was spacious because she was full, because she had something in common, even in repose, with a projectile, of great size, loaded and ready for use. That indeed, to Susie's romantic mind, announced itself as half the charm of their renewal--a charm as of sitting in springtime, during a long peace, on the daisied, grassy bank of some great slumbering fortress. True to her psychological instincts, certainly, Mrs. Stringham had noted that the [...] "sentiment" [...] she rejoiced in on her old schoolmate's part was all a matter of action and movement, was not, save for the interweaving of a more frequent plump [...] "dearest" [...] than she would herself perhaps have used, a matter of much <b>other</b> <b>embroidery.</b> She brooded, with interest, on this further remark of race, feeling in her own spirit a different economy. The joy, for her, was to know why she acted--the reason was half the business; whereas with Mrs. Lowder there might have been no reason: [...] "why" [...] was the trivial seasoning-substance, the vanilla or the nutmeg, omittable from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it. Mrs. Lowder's desire was clearly sharp that their young companions should also prosper together; and Mrs. Stringham's account of it all to Milly, during the first days, was that when, at Lancaster Gate, she was not occupied in telling, as it were, about her, she was occupied in hearing much of the history of her hostess's brilliant niece.|$|E
60|$|The {{people of}} France {{have made it}} no secret that those of England, as a general thing, are to their {{perception}} an inexpressive and speechless race, perpendicular and unsociable, unaddicted to enriching any bareness of contact with verbal or <b>other</b> <b>embroidery.</b> This view might have derived encouragement, a few years ago, in Paris, from {{the manner in which}} four persons sat together in silence, one fine day about noon, in the garden, as it is called, of the Palais de l'Industrie--the central court of the great glazed bazaar where, among plants and parterres, gravelled walks and thin fountains, are ranged the figures and groups, the monuments and busts, which form in the annual exhibition of the Salon the department of statuary. The spirit of observation is naturally high at the Salon, quickened by a thousand artful or artless appeals, but it need have put forth no great intensity to take in the characters I mention. As a solicitation of the eye on definite grounds these visitors too constituted a successful plastic fact; and even the most superficial observer would have marked them as products of an insular neighbourhood, representatives of that tweed-and-waterproof class with which, on the recurrent occasions when the English turn out for a holiday--Christmas and Easter, Whitsuntide and the autumn--Paris besprinkles itself at a night's notice. They had about them the indefinable professional look of the British traveller abroad; the air of preparation for exposure, material and moral, which is so oddly combined with the serene revelation of security and of persistence, and which excites, according to individual susceptibility, the ire or the admiration of foreign communities. They were the more unmistakable as they presented mainly the happier aspects of the energetic race to which they had the honour to belong. The fresh diffused light of the Salon made them clear and important; they were finished creations, in their way, and, ranged there motionless on their green bench, were almost as much on exhibition {{as if they had been}} hung on the line.|$|E

5000|$|Assuming Odo {{commissioned}} the tapestry, {{it was probably}} designed and constructed in England by Anglo-Saxon artists (Odo's main power base being by then in Kent); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; <b>other</b> <b>embroideries</b> originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes {{can be found in}} cloth traditionally woven there. Howard B. Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was Scolland, the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at Mont Saint-Michel (famed for its illumination), his travels to Trajan's Column, and his connections to Wadard and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry. [...] The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needle workers. Anglo-Saxon needlework of the more detailed type known as Opus Anglicanum was famous across Europe. It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of Byrhtnoth.|$|R

50|$|Almost any plainweave fabric {{can be made}} {{suitable}} for goldwork and <b>other</b> metal <b>embroidery.</b> Fine linen is among the easiest to work with.

5000|$|... "Needlepoint" [...] {{refers to}} a {{particular}} set of stitching techniques worked upon stiff openwork canvas.However, [...] "needlepoint" [...] is not synonymous with all types of embroidery. Because it is stitched on a fabric that is an open grid, needlepoint is not embellishing a fabric, {{as is the case with}} most other types of embroidery, but literally the making of a new fabric. It is for this reason that many needlepoint stitches must be of sturdier construction than <b>other</b> <b>embroidery</b> stitches.|$|E

5000|$|Galilee: Collections {{reveal that}} there was a {{distinct}} Galilee women's style from at least the middle of the 19th century. The standard form was a coat (Jillayeh), tunic and trousers. Cross-stitch was not used much, the women preferring patchwork patterns of diamond and rectangular shapes, as well as <b>other</b> <b>embroidery</b> techniques. In the 1860s, H.B. Tristram described costumes in the villages of El Bussah and Isfia as being either [...] "plain, patched or embroidered in the most fantastic and grotesque shapes". Towards the beginning of the 20th century Turkish/Ottoman fashions began to dominate: such as baggy trousers and cord edging. Materials, particularly silks, were brought from Damascus. Before the arrival of European colour-fast dyes the Galilee was an important area for the growing of indago and sumac which were used for creating blue and red dyes.|$|E

5000|$|The name slip {{as used in}} {{needlework}} {{derives from}} the horticultural sense, where it describes a cutting of a plant used for grafting.Canvaswork floral slips and other motifs appliquéd to a woven background fabric such as velvet or damask became common in England from the mid-14th century, replacing the all-over embroidery of Opus Anglicanum. These were worked with silk thread in tent stitch on linen canvas, cut out, and applied to the ground fabric, often with an outline and embellishments of couched thread or cord or <b>other</b> <b>embroidery.</b> Slips were also appliquéd of rich fabrics on plainer ones, similarly detailed with couched cord and embroidery. This style of decoration is characteristic of later medieval ecclesiastical embroidery (and probably of domestic embroidery as well, although little of this survives). Following {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries during the English Reformation, rich vestments were cut up and the fabrics and motifs reused to make secular furnishings. [...] Appliquéd slips of both old fabric and new canvaswork are characteristic of domestic textiles such as chair covers, cushions, and especially wall hangings and bed curtains throughout the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras.|$|E
40|$|Chikankari is {{an ancient}} form of white floral embroidery, {{intricately}} worked with needle and raw thread. Its delicacy is mesmeric. For centuries, this fine white tracery on transparent white fabric has delighted the heart of king and commoner alike. It is centered mainly in the northern heartland of India, namely Lucknow, the capital of a large state, called Uttar Pradesh. It is a complex and elegant craft that has come down to us, evolving, over the years into an aesthetic form of great beauty. That it has survived the loss of royal patronage, suffered deeply {{at the hands of}} commercialization, lost its way sometimes in mediocrity and yet stayed alive, is a tribute to the skill and will of the craftspersons who have handed down this technique from one generation to another. There exist several kinds of white embroidery in Europe and across the world, each unique and distinct. Students of this craft like to believe that all forms of embroidery, in some way influence, imitate or complement each other. That may be true to some extent, but right at the onset, let me say that Chikankari is a genre quite unique from <b>other</b> <b>embroideries.</b> Chikankari is at once, simple and elegant, subtle and ornate.

5000|$|Smocking is an {{embroidery}} {{technique used}} to gather fabric {{so that it}} can stretch. Before elastic, smocking was commonly used in cuffs, bodices, and necklines in garments where buttons were undesirable. Smocking developed in England and has been practised since the Middle Ages and is unusual among embroidery methods in that it was often worn by laborers. <b>Other</b> major <b>embroidery</b> styles are purely decorative and represented status symbols. Smocking was practical for garments to be both form fitting and flexible, hence its name derives from smock [...] - [...] a farmer's work shirt.

50|$|Embroideries {{that can}} be {{performed}} on plainweave do not require the crafter to perform stitches at a precise thread count.
