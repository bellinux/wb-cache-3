25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> purposes in reading them.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to interact with one another. An easily visualized metaphor {{is a group of}} separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each [...] "soap bubble" [...] of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> spacetime is denoted as the Universe, just as we call our moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse. With this terminology, different Universes are not causally connected to each other. In principle, the other unconnected Universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative. Others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate Universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal origin.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the focus}} on melodramatic space adventure, the fiction in Planet Stories {{improved}} {{over the next few}} years, largely due to the work of Brackett and Bradbury. [...] Both writers set many of their stories on a romanticized version of Mars that owed much to the Barsoom of Edgar Rice Burroughs. [...] Brackett's writing improved during the 1940s from formulaic pulp adventure to a more mature style, and she became the most accomplished writer of planetary romances of her day. [...] She wrote a well-received series of stories featuring adventurer Eric John Stark, which began in the Summer 1949 Planet Stories with [...] "Queen of the Martian Catacombs". [...] Her work had a strong influence on other writers, in particular Gardner F. Fox, Lin Carter and Marion Zimmer Bradley, [...] Brackett later argued that [...] "the so-called space opera is the folk-tale, the hero-tale of <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> niche in history". [...] Also arguing in support of Planet Stories, science fiction critic John Clute has commented that [...] "the content was far more sophisticated than the covers".|$|E

500|$|His other revolutionary {{activity}} {{at the time was}} {{as a member of the}} Fincastle County Committee of Safety, an outgrowth of the Virginia Committee of Correspondence. The Virginia Committee of Correspondence was formed on March 12, 1773, and requested each county to do the same. The British refused to address the issues that were of greatest concern to the colonists, and so the freeholders of Fincastle County met at the Lead Mines on January 20, 1775, forming a Committee of Safety in which Trigg was a member. They were one of the first to respond to the request of the Virginia Committee of Correspondence to form such a body. Committees of Safety basically served as provisional governments for their area. It was also at this meeting that they drew up the Fincastle Resolutions, which was a precursor to the Declaration of Independence issued by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776; Trigg was one of the signatories. The resolutions, addressed to the Virginia members of the Continental Congress, contained the boldest assertion of the grievances and rights of the American colonies. In February 1775, he wrote to his brother-in-law William Christian, suggesting they call another meeting of the freeholders to elect their delegates to the second Virginia Convention. With the news that William Christian was leaving with the Fincastle militia company to Williamsburg to fight, Trigg took over as chairman of the Committee of Safety. On October 7, 1775, they met to express their appreciation of Trigg, writing that [...] "together with the most exemplary zeal and attachment to the liberties of your country, and your indefatigable industry in the service thereof, you merit and deserve <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> thanks." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bonobo {{reproductive}} {{rates are}} {{no higher than}} those of the common chimpanzee. During oestrus, females undergo a swelling of the perineal tissue lasting 10 to 20 days. Most matings occur during the maximum swelling. The gestation period is on average 240 days. Postpartum amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years. Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity. Mothers will help their sons get more matings from females in estrus. Adult male bonobos have sex with infants. Frans de Waal, an ethologist who has studied bonobos, remarked, [...] "A lot of the things we see, like pedophilia and homosexuality, may be leftovers that some now consider unacceptable in <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> society." ...|$|E

His {{objection}} is similar to one we might make against a worker who constructs a flat-head screwdriver to help him build a home, and who then accuses a screw of unreality when he comes upon a Phillips-screw that his flat-head screwdriver won't fit. In his works after Riddles, Schiller's attack {{takes the form of}} reminding the abstract metaphysician that abstractions are meant as tools for dealing with the [...] "lower" [...] world of particulars and physicality, and that after constructing abstractions we cannot simply drop the un-abstracted world out of our account. The un-abstracted world is the entire reason for making abstractions in the first place. We did not abstract to reach the unchanging and eternal truths; we abstract to construct an imperfect and rough tool for dealing with life in <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> and concrete world. It is the working of the higher in [...] "making predictions about the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping the future behavior of things for the purpose of shaping our own conduct accordingly" [...] that justifies the higher.|$|E
2500|$|Kahlo's popular {{appeal is}} seen to stem first and {{foremost}} from a fascination with her life story, especially its painful and tragic aspects. She has become an icon for several minority groups and political movements, such as feminists, the LGBTQ community, and Chicanos. Oriana Baddeley has written that Kahlo has become a signifier of non-conformity and [...] "the archetype of a cultural minority," [...] who is regarded simultaneously as [...] "a victim, crippled and abused" [...] and as [...] "a survivor who fights back." [...] Edward Sullivan stated that Kahlo is hailed as a hero by so many because she is [...] "someone to validate their own struggle {{to find their own}} voice and their own public personalities". According to John Berger, Kahlo's popularity is partly {{due to the fact that}} [...] "the sharing of pain is one of the essential preconditions for a refinding of dignity and hope" [...] in twenty-first century society. Kirk Varnedoe, the former chief curator of MoMA, has also stated that Kahlo's posthumous success is linked to the way in which [...] "she clicks with today’s sensibilities—her psycho-obsessive concern with herself, her creation of a personal alternative world carries a voltage. Her constant remaking of her identity, her construction of a theater of the self are exactly what preoccupy such contemporary artists as Cindy Sherman or Kiki Smith and, on a more popular level, Madonna...

2500|$|Ode: Intimations of Immortality {{is about}} childhood, but the poem doesn't {{completely}} focus on childhood {{or what was}} lost from childhood. Instead, the ode, like The Prelude and Tintern Abbey, places an emphasis on how an adult develops from a child and how being absorbed in nature inspires a deeper connection to humanity. The ode focuses not on Dorothy or on Wordsworth's love, Mary Hutchinson, but on himself and {{is part of what}} is called his [...] "egotistical sublime". Of his childhood, Wordsworth told Catherine Clarkson in an 1815 letter that the poem [...] "rests entirely upon two recollections of childhood, one that of a splendour in the objects of sense which is passed away, and the other an indisposition to bend to the law of death as applying to <b>our</b> <b>particular</b> case.... A Reader who has not a vivid recollection of these feelings having existed in his mind in childhood cannot understand the poem." [...] Childhood, therefore, becomes a means to exploring memory, and the imagination, as Wordsworth claims in the letter, is connected to man's understanding of immortality. In a letter to Isabella Fenwick, he explained his particular feelings about immortality that he held when young: [...] "I was often unable to think of external things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature." [...] These feelings were influenced by Wordsworth's own experience of loss, including the death of his parents, and may have isolated him from society if the feelings did not ease as he matured.|$|E
