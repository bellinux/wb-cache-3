50|$|In February 1972, Lehnberg {{began her}} first {{job as a}} {{clerical}} assistant/receptionist at the Red Cross Children's Hospital in Rondebosch, Cape Town. She started work in the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshop</b> alongside Christiaan van der Linde. Van der Linde was the workshop's chief technician and Lehnberg, a bright, intelligent and attractive 16-year-old, was apparently drawn {{to him from the}} start.|$|E
50|$|It {{was around}} this time that Lehnberg met Marthinus Charles Choegoe who had lost a leg in a {{motorcar}} accident. He {{had come to the}} <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>Workshop</b> to have an artificial limb fitted. He was unemployed, and his disabilities, both physical and social, had destroyed his self-esteem and this made him particularly susceptible to Lehnberg's approaches.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{characteristics of}} hip disarticulation and hemipelvectomy amputees, {{to assess their}} level of activities, participation and experienced limitations in mobility and to describe the amputation-related problems. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: Patients were mainly recruited via <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshops</b> in the Netherlands. Subjects: Forty-six patients with an acquired unilateral hip disarticulation or hemipelvectomy {{at least one year}} post amputation. Main outcome measures: Sickness Impact Profile 68 (SIP 68) to assess the level of activity and participation and the questionnaire Rising and Sitting Down, Walking and Climbing Stairs to assess perceived limitations in mobility. Results: The 46 patients (31 with hip disarticulation and 15 with hemipelvectomy) had a mean age of 55. 8 years (SD 12. 1). In 78 % of cases the reason for amputation was a tumour. Mean SIP 68 was low, 10, 5 (SD 6, 9). Hip disarticulation amputees had significantly poorer emotional stability than the hemipelvectomy amputees (P= 0. 04). amputees experienced considerable limitations in their mobility according to the Rising and Sitting Down, Walking and Climbing Stairs scores. Conclusions: Hip disarticulation and hemipelvectomy amputees have a relatively high level of activity and participation (SIP scores) {{but at the same time}} experience limitations in walking, rising and sitting down and climbing stairs...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To explore job adjustments, job satisfaction, {{and health}} {{experience}} among employees with an upper limb amputation and {{to compare the}} results with those of lower limb amputees and control subjects. Methods: Amputees were recruited from data files of a large European University Medical Centre and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshops.</b> Controls were matched colleagues of the lower limb amputees. All participants filled out the VAG questionnaire (Vragenlijst Arbeid en Gezondheid), assessing job satisfaction and job adjustments, and the RAND- 36. Results: 28 upper limb amputees were compared to 144 lower limb amputees and 144 controls. Job adjustments were necessary in 38 % and 28 % of upper and lower limb amputees, respectively. All three groups were equally satisfied with their jobs (p= 0. 90). Vocational rehabilitation was applied to 26 % and 8 % of upper and lower limb amputees, respectively. Upper limb amputees rated their general health worse (18 points, 95 % CI: 12 - 25) compared to lower limb amputees, corrected for effects of confounders (age and co-morbidity). Conclusions: Upper and lower limb amputees have high job satisfaction and a minority need job adjustments. In upper limb amputees, {{the causes of the}} worrisome general health experience need further investigation. In upper and lower limb amputees, vocational rehabilitation deserves additional attention...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study attempted {{to estimate the}} severity of health complaints and disabilities in patients supplied with foot orthoses for degenerative foot disorders in the Netherlands. Information on the severity {{and the distribution of}} the complaints in these patients is important to acquire insight in the problems which these patients experience, and moreover is essential for further research, especially for evaluating effects of patients undergoing foot orthosis treatment. Patients with degenerative foot disorders aged 18 years and over were recruited from nine <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshops</b> over a period of three months in 2000. One hundred and twenty-two (122) patients were included in the study. Two approaches were used to obtain data. Firstly, shoe technicians and orthotists inspected patients' feet and legs and interviewed them at their initial visit. Data on gender, age, height, weight, existing and prescribed orthotic devices were recorded on a report form. Secondly, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire assessing type, location, frequency, intensity and duration of health complaints, and disability. Data indicate that females with degenerative foot disorders and foot orthoses are twice as common as men. Patients supplied with foot orthoses are twice as often overweight compared to subjects in the general population. Besides frequent and protracted pain there are also fatigue complaints, particularly in the feet and lower leg. Duration and frequency of the complaints suggest that these patients suffer from a chronic pain syndrome. In addition, the results indicate that the functional level of these patients is below that of the general population, in particular regarding physical activities...|$|R
50|$|Finally, he {{was sent}} to Cairo and there {{he spent most of his}} {{military}} service under the aegis of Dudley Buxton, the orthopaedic surgeon. Buxton had a high opinion of Charnley and gave him more responsibilities by sending him to the 2nd Orthopaedic Centre and putting him in charge of the new <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshop.</b> That experience probably encouraged him to apply for the orthopaedic school in 1942, with the support of his senior colleagues. He was promoted to the rank of Acting Major on 2 December 1942.|$|E
5000|$|Lehnberg first {{contacted}} Choegoe by letter, {{which she}} wrote to him care of Solly's Trading Store, his local shop. In the letter, {{she asked him to}} come and see her at the <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>Workshop</b> and added that if he were smart he could still earn good money. When he turned up at the workshop, Lehnberg gave him R1.00 and asked him to meet her at the Rondebosch town hall at 7 p.m. that evening, where she gave him a bottle of gin and said that she wanted him to murder a woman for her. Choegoe at first declined, saying that he would be sent to the gallows.|$|E
40|$|Based on six {{series of}} {{patients}} (n 198) participating in clinical field testing of prosthetic feet and all provided with trans-tibial prostheses {{in accordance with}} the polypropylene component and assembly system developed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) follow-up studies by teams consisting of an orthopaedic surgeon and a Category-I prosthetist-orthotist were conducted. A series of quality measures were tested against previously published quality benchmarks. The polypropylene system gives a consistent product and allows for increased demands on quality benchmarks. The acceptance of discomfort and pain could be reduced to 5 + 5 %. The technical performance demands were reduced for misalignment to 10 + 5 %. In general for all quality measures the range could be reduced to+ 5 %. These new demands reflect what an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshop</b> outside of a teaching system should be able to attain...|$|E
40|$|Use of a {{prosthesis}} {{in lower}} limb amputees {{can lead to}} skin problems of the amputation stump. However, {{little is known about}} the epidemiology and type of problems experienced. We conducted a cross-sectional survey con-sisting of a questionnaire and a clinical assessment of the amputation stump. The aims of the study were to esti-mate the prevalence of skin problems of the amputation stump, to evaluate the impact of these skin problems and to evaluate differences between clinically observed skin problems and skin problems reported by the amputee. Participants (n = 124) were recruited from among lower limb amputees who visited an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshop.</b> The prevalence of skin problems was 36 %. Problems identi-fied were: reduction in prosthesis use, and reduction in walking distance without a break. Significantly more skin problems were reported than observed (p = 0. 011). Cold skin and excessive perspiration in particular were significantly more reported than observed. Key words: skin problems; lower limb amputees; questionnaire; samp-ling study...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : To analyse how {{decisions}} to dichotomise {{the frequency and}} impediment of phantom pain into absent and present influence the outcome of studies by performing a sensitivity analysis on an existing database. Method : Five hundred and thirty-six subjects were recruited from the database of an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>workshop</b> and filled out a questionnaire in which the following items were assessed: demographics, side, date, level and reason of amputation, presence and frequency of phantom sensations, phantom pain and stump pain, and impediment due to phantom pain. Results : The prevalence of phantom pain ranged from 7 - 72 % when different cut off points for the frequency of phantom pain were applied. The significance of the various risk factors for the prevalence of phantom pain changed when different cut off points were applied. Only stump pain and phantom sensations were significant risk factors for all cut off points. Risk factors for the impediment of phantom pain changed when different cut off points were applied and these risk factors were different from those for the prevalence of phantom pain. Conclusion : The choice of cut off points influences the outcome of phantom pain studies considerably. This study provides {{some insight into the}} differences in prevalence and risk factors found in literature...|$|E
