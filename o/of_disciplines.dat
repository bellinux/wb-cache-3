40|$|Parents use {{different}} ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> {{the children in}} the family. The purpose of the research is to study ways, attitudes and intergenerational relations between disciplining {{the children in the}} family. One hundred and three parents appraised their ways <b>of</b> children <b>disciplining,</b> their attitudes towards the ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining,</b> the context <b>of</b> experiencing, modes <b>of</b> implementing <b>discipline</b> and ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> <b>of</b> their mother and father when they were 10 years old. More than half of the parents describe the use of {{at least one of the}} ways of physical punishment respectively, at least one of the ways of psychical violence as a way <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> children in the family. Punishment ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> are connected with the experience of spousal conflict in the family, ineffectiveness, stress and the impulsive way of a response due to children <b>disciplining.</b> The acceptability <b>of</b> punishment and non-punishment ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> are positively connected with the frequency of use of this ways <b>of</b> <b>disciplining.</b> The research presented here shows a possibility that the use of a certain way <b>of</b> <b>disciplining</b> children in the family does not necessarily have a connection with a similar disciplining experience in the childhood.

He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast.

5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set <b>of</b> <b>disciplines</b> into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.|$|E
