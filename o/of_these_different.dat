5|$|Called {{by nearly}} a dozen {{different}} names and with varying words, melodies and purpose but common themes, the song's history reflects many of the evolutionary changes and cross-currents of American music. It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns, persists through that century, manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind inmate convicted of murder, and sees use in the 1950s as a folk song, before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane. Several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> variants of the song are still performed in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} in {{the south}} and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter {{in the south}}west of the US.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Maya had {{diverse and}} {{sophisticated}} methods of food production. It {{was believed that}} shifting cultivation (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food, but it is now thought that permanent raised fields, terracing, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas. Indeed, evidence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals {{can be seen on}} aerial photographs. Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times, and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, manioc, sunflower seeds, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.|$|E
5|$|The major revolt {{began on}} September 20, 1260. It was {{triggered}} by the Lithuanian and Samogitian military victory against the joint forces of the Livonian Order and Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Durbe. As the uprising was spreading through Prussian lands, each clan chose a leader: the Sambians were led by Glande, the Natangians by Herkus Monte, the Bartians by Diwanus, the Warmians by Glappe, the Pogesanians by Auktume. One clan that did not join the uprising was the Pomesanians. The uprising was also supported by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians. However, {{there was no one}} leader to coordinate efforts <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> forces. Herkus Monte, who was educated in Germany, became the best known and most successful of the leaders, but he commanded only his Natangians.|$|E

5|$|While a few leopard sharks {{have been}} {{documented}} traveling hundreds of kilometers, most individuals tend to remain in a localized area for much of their lives. This low level of dispersal has led to genetic divergence across its range. Seven discrete gene pools have been identified along the Californian coast between Humboldt Bay and San Diego. Of these, the Humboldt Bay subpopulation {{is perhaps the most}} isolated, with the sharks there maturing at a larger size and producing fewer offspring than those from other areas. By contrast, the area around Los Angeles represents a genetic transitional zone between subpopulations whose boundaries are more diffuse. Off Baja California, the leopard sharks on the Pacific side are probably distinct from those in the northern Gulf of California. Although there is equivocal evidence for natal philopatry (returning to one's birthplace to breed) in this species, proximity to established breeding grounds likely contributes to the structuring <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> subpopulations.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler differents for a 0 -dimensional scheme X in the projective n-space P^n_K over an arbitrary field K. In particular, we focus on studying {{the relations between the}} algebraic structure <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> and geometric properties of the scheme X. In Chapter 1 we give an outline to the problems this thesis is concerned with, a brief literature review for each problem, and the main results regarding these problems. Chapter 2 contains background results that we will need in the subsequent chapters. We introduce the concept of maximal p_j-subschemes of a 0 -dimensional scheme X and give some descriptions of them and their Hilbert functions. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of a separator of a subscheme of X of degree deg(X) - 1 to a set of separators of a maximal p_j-subscheme of X. In Chapter 3 we explore the Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler differents for 0 -dimensional schemes X. First we define <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> for X, {{and take a look at}} how to compute <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> and examine their relations. Then we give an answer to the question "What are the Hilbert functions <b>of</b> <b>these</b> differents?" in some cases. In Chapter 4 we use the differents to investigate the Cayley-Bacharach property of 0 -dimensional schemes over an arbitrary field K. The principal results of this chapter are characterizations of CB-schemes and of arithmetically Gorenstein schemes in terms of their Dedekind differents and a criterion for a 0 -dimensional smooth scheme to be a complete intersection. We also generalize some results such as Dedekind's formula and the characterization of the Cayley-Bacharach property by using Liaison theory. In addition, several propositions on the uniformities are proven. In Chapter 5 we are interested in studying the Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler differents for finite special classes of schemes and finding out some applications <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>differents.</b> First, we investigate <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> for reduced 0 -dimensional almost complete intersections X in P^n_K over a perfect field K. Then we investigate the relationships between <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> and the i-th Fitting ideals of the module of Kähler differentials of the homogeneous coordinate ring of X. Finally, we look more closely at the Hilbert functions and the regularity indices <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>differents</b> for fat point schemes...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of atmospheric particulates that can act as CCN. The particles may be composed of dust or clay, soot or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, sea salt from ocean wave spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, sulfate from volcanic activity, phytoplankton or the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The ability <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the hygroscopic properties <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>different</b> constituents are very different. Sulfate and sea salt, for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon and mineral particles do not. This is made even more {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the chemical species may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon). Additionally, while some particles (such as soot and minerals) do not make very good CCN, they do act as ice nuclei in colder parts of the atmosphere.|$|E
