5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with Bits and Pieces, {{after which he}} started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E
5|$|The Shafi'i {{school of}} thought accepts qiyas as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, {{considered}} it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur'an and sunnah. According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the predictability and uniformity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> legal system.|$|E

5|$|The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{location}} (see: Sound localization) {{represents the}} cognitive placement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> in an environmental context; including the placement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> {{on both the}} horizontal and vertical plane, {{the distance from the}} sound source and the characteristics of the sonic environment. In a thick texture, it is possible to identify multiple sound sources using a combination of spatial location and timbre identification. It is the main reason why we can pick the sound of an oboe in an orchestra and the words of a single person at a cocktail party.|$|E

25|$|The audio {{fidelity}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> groove is debatably {{better if}} it is engraved on a cylinder due to better linear tracking.

25|$|Noise {{is a term}} {{often used}} to refer to an {{unwanted}} sound. In science and engineering, noise is an undesirable component that obscures a wanted signal.

25|$|Riggenbach's 1991 {{study of}} fluency {{development}} in Chinese learners of English had {{an analysis of}} repair phenomena, which included retraced restarts and unretraced restarts. Retraced restarts refer to the reformulations whereby {{a portion of the}} original utterance is duplicated. They can either involve repetition, that is, the precise adjacent duplication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> syllable, word or phrase, or insertion, which refers to a retraced restart with the addition of new unretraced lexical items. Conversely, unretraced restarts refer to reformulations that reject the original utterance, similarly known as false starts.|$|E
25|$|International Science Times {{posited that}} the hikers' deaths {{were caused by}} hypothermia, which can induce a {{behavior}} known as paradoxical undressing in which hypothermic subjects remove their clothes in response to perceived feelings of burning warmth. That six out of nine hikers died of hypothermia is undisputed. However, others in the group appear to have acquired additional clothing (from those who had already died) which suggests that they were <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> enough mind to try to add layers. However, there is no explanation for how this behavior could happen to all nine hikers, at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Sound {{localization}} is {{the process}} of determining the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources. Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the azimuth or horizontal angle, the zenith or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds). Humans, as most four-legged animals, are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of owls have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the reasons}} of {{unification}} of accents in, for example, mixed diphthongs, there possibly {{is the absence}} of necessity to distinguish between them. For example, in the case of várna 'crow' - var̃nas 'raven', the r would probably usually be emphasized in var̃nas, but in a case of var̃das 'name', where there is no relative acute word, there can be no feeling for a speaker, that he / she should emphasize a sound r. But in these cases the distinction can be understood through quantity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> – the acute variant has lengthened a, and the circumflex – not lengthened. So, in diphthongs, the problematic leave i, u starting diphthongs, where a standard language speaker have no means to hear, directly know what type of the accent they should have (if they are stressed).|$|E
25|$|The Waikato {{invasion}} {{began in}} July 1863. However, {{after a very}} short advance, Cameron, whose Crimean experience had taught him the importance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> supply line, realised his supply lines were severely threatened by the enemy. He spent three months securing his rear from attacks. He sent recruiting officers Dillon Bell (former Colonial Treasurer and current Minister of Native Affairs) and John Gorst (former Waikato magistrate) to Australia to raise volunteer forces, which were largely formed into company-based units from the individual states. In all, 2400 Australians volunteered to fight {{in a variety of}} units against the Māori forces. In addition, the Australian states willingly sold the New Zealand government vast quantities of rifles, ammunition, uniforms, horses and bullocks, as well as nearly all their latest Armstrong guns and shells to equip the 7000 New Zealand militiamen.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{breakdown}} of international diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis, the fighting in the Six-Day War of 1967 began on 6 June 1967 with surprise Israeli air strikes that destroyed the entire Egyptian air force {{while it was still}} on the ground. In spite of Israel's request to Jordan to desist from attacking it, Jordan along with Syria began to shell Israeli targets. In addition, Hussein, reluctant at first, sent ineffective bomber strikes because of Nasser's requests and affirmation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> Egyptian victory. Attacks on other Arab air forces took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts. A subsequent ground invasion into Egyptian territory led to Israel's conquest of the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. With the rapid and rather unexpected success on the Egyptian front, Israel decided to attack and successfully captured the West Bank from Jordan on June 7, and the Golan Heights from Syria on June 9.|$|E
