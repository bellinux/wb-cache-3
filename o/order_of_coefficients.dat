40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} method {{for the design}} of causal stable IIR lter bank (FB) with Powers-of-two coefficients. Ladder structure is used to construct the IIR FBs with perfect reconstruction (PR). In the proposed method, FBs with real coefficients are first designed and an iterative procedure is then employed to discretize the coefficients. A sensitivity measure is introduced to determine the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> to be discretized. To ensure the stability of the IIR filters, the stability triangle is used. Even though the method is suboptimal, it avoids integer programing and yields satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{structure}} of a program to generate the truncation error coefficients for Runge-Kutta (RK) methods is reformulated to reduce storage requirements significantly and to accommodate variable dimensioning. This FORTRAN program, SUBROUTINE RKEQ, determines truncation error coefficients for RK algorithms for orders 1 through 10 and extends the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> through 12 with the 11 th- and 12 th-order terms determined following the patterns used to establish the lower order coefficients. Both subroutines (the original and RKEQ) are also written to treat RK m-fold methods which utilize m known derivatives of f to increase {{the order of the}} algorithm. Setting m = 0 gives the classical RK algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The volume, {{location}} of the centroid, and second order moments of a threedimensional star-shaped object are determined {{in terms of the}} spherical harmonic coefficients of its boundary function. Bounds on the surface area of the object are derived in terms of the spherical harmonic coefficients as well. Sufficient conditions under which the moments and area computed from the truncated spherical harmonic series converge to the actual moments and area are established. The proposed method is verified using a scanned head model and by recent measurements of the 433 Eros asteroid. An extension to non-star-shaped objects of genus 0 is provided. The computational complexity of our method is shown to be equal to that of the discrete spherical harmonic transform, which is O(N 2 log 2 N), where N is the maximum <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> retained in the expansion. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{filter bank}} {{based on an}} allpass IIR filter with brick-wall {{response}} was designed by A. J. Van Leest in [17]; however, the delay in the filter bank is too long {{to be used in}} real time applications. In order to reduce the delay, the orders of coefficients, transition bandwidth and filter bank structures must be optimized. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> can be reduced by increasing the stopband attenuation. In order to further reduce the delay, the sharpness of the filter bank has to be reduced. This thesis also discussed the number of band and filter bank structure against to filter bank delay. The filter bank can be used in non-real time application such as CD compression with high order coefficient. The minimum transition bandwidth can be reached at 0. 03257 pi/number of band. This thesis expands upon DCT modulations of IIR based modulated filter banks and investigate the Hartley transformation in filter bank modulation as a new modulation technique. These modulation techniques generate the real output signal with real input signals. The quantization errors from quantizing the coefficient are studied. It is concluded that at least 16 bits are required in order for a filter bank to give a good performance as designed without quantization...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many works {{investigated}} the trophic structure of communities stressing, in particular, {{the role played}} by species in food webs (e. g., their trophic level and, more recently, their centrality). There exist some encouraging applications, but few details are known about the relationships between centrality measurements and trophic levels. In addition, these studies almost refer to unweighted trophic networks, despite the acknowledged need of investigating weighted webs. Here we aim to contribute to the synthetic treatment of these complementary issues by analyzing several indices of centrality and trophic level. Studying 19 ecosystems, we ranked the nodes according to their positional importance values (based on various centrality indices) and we compared the rank <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> with unweighted or weighted trophic levels. Our goal was revealing potential biases in finding high centrality nodes among basal, intermediate and top species. We found that key species occupy intermediate positions of the trophic hierarchy. In case of unweighted data, trophic levels of key nodes do not deviate from trends displayed by the whole dataset. Significant differences were observed when using weighted data. These results contradict the common belief of many ecologists that identified top-predators and charismatic megafauna as main targets of conservation policies. We discuss the potential consequences of the observed features on ecosystem dynamics...|$|E

Since various measures proposed by many researchers in various situations increases the list of measures and these are not able to use as a common measures to evaluate the rules, knowledge finders are not able to identify a perfect measure to ensure the actual knowledge on database. In this study, we presented about a ranking method to identify a perfect measure, which also reduces the number of measures. Ranking will be done by increasing <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> Variation (CV) and not applicable measures are eliminated.

40|$|Precomputed {{radiance}} transfer {{techniques have}} been broadly used for supporting complex illumination effects on diffuse and glossy objects. Although {{working with the}} wavelet domain is efficient in handling all-frequency illumination, the spherical harmonics domain is more convenient for interactively changing lights and views on the fly due to the rotational invariant nature of the spherical harmonic domain. For interactive lighting, however, the number <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> must be limited and the high <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> have to be eliminated. Therefore spherical harmonic lighting has been preferred and practiced only for interactive soft-diffuse lighting. In this paper, we propose a simple but practical filtering solution using locally adaptive products <b>of</b> high-order harmonic <b>coefficients</b> within the genuine spherical harmonic lighting framework. Our approach works out on the fly in two folds. We first conduct multi-level filtering on vertices {{in order to determine}} regions of interests, where the high <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> harmonics are necessary for high frequency lighting. The initially determined regions of interests are then refined through filling in the incomplete regions by traveling the neighboring vertices. Even not relying on graphics hardware, the proposed method allows to compute high <b>order</b> products <b>of</b> spherical harmonic lighting for both diffuse and specular lighting...|$|R

30|$|As briefly {{discussed}} in the previous section, based on the residual plots in Figs.  8 and  10, {{the form of the}} regression model fitted to the data set is an appropriate fit. This form of the model is consistent with the main factors influencing coke strength after reaction identified by Díez et al. (2002). When the VDCs were added to the regression, the behavior of residuals in these residual plots remained approximately consistent with the original regression model, and the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the regression model changed minimally between the models. This suggests that the introduction of the VDC attribute is including new information within the regression model. Based on the <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> <b>coefficients</b> in Fig.  7, it is suggested that blends where coals of dissimilar rank are used, will behave least similar to a single coal, implying that these coals together combine better than a single coal of comparable properties would.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGeneral {{methods of}} nuclear Fréchet spaces in {{conjunction}} with the theory of Köthe sequence spaces have been used to obtain a basis criterion for power sequence spaces. How this basis criterion is thus yielding a refinement of Cannon's criterion in the case of space of holomorphic functions is illustrated here. Hence, we give a characterization of those infinite matrices for which the respective Bessel polynomials constitute a basis in the space of holomorphic functions. Consequently, an answer to the question posed by H. L. Krall and O. Frink (Trans. Amer. Math.
