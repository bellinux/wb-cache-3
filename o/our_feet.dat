500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire to hear them. I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked until our shoes were worn out, and <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E
500|$|In early July, {{prior to}} the offensive, Abu Ali sent letters to Fatah leaders chastising them for {{surrendering}} to King Hussein's forces, stating in defiance [...] "We will die on <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> rather than kneel." [...] On July 23, he was reported killed by the Jordanian Army. According to Yezid Sayigh who documented the history of Palestinian guerrilla warfare, Abu Ali was [...] "executed" [...] during mop-up operations by the Jordanian Army sometime on July 17–18. Jordanian Bedouin troops tied his corpse to a tank and dragged it through several northern villages that had large Palestinian populations. The PLO claimed he was captured and tortured to death by Jordanian forces prior. Another version of events by Abu Ali's partisans was that the Jordanian prime minister at the time, Wasfi al-Tal, was personally responsible for his torture.|$|E

500|$|Smetana's eight operas {{created the}} bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is {{performed}} regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly {{became part of the}} repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a [...] "gem of the first order", is nevertheless [...] "a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind." [...] Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says [...] "lifts us off <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> with its madcap vivacity", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: [...] "The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.|$|E
500|$|The Apple Corps {{shareholders}} considered The Beatles: Rock Band {{a new way}} {{to introduce}} the band's music to the public. They approved of the songs and venues that would appear in the game, and provided feedback on the artwork, character representations, and storyboards for animation sequences. McCartney and Starr fact-checked certain anecdotes relating to The Beatles while Ono and Harrison provided insight on their late husbands' performances and lyrics. At the developer's request, Ono visited the Harmonix offices late in development to provide critical feedback on several visual elements. In a Wired article, MTV's {{senior vice president of the}} games division Paul DeGooyer was quoted saying [...] "She gave the designers hell", with Harmonix head Alex Rigopulos adding, [...] "She really held <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> to the fire". DeGooyer and Rigopulos clarified the statement soon after the article had been published, asserting that the visit was [...] "a high point of the two-year development process" [...] and [...] "has been mischaracterized by some in the press".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Lyautey did {{not wish}} to abandon the inland {{territory}} his men had fought so hard for, stating that if he withdrew [...] "such a shock would result immediately all over Morocco... that a general revolt would arise under <b>our</b> <b>feet,</b> on all our points". [...] Left with just 20 battalions of legionnaires (mainly German and Austrian), military criminals of the Infanterie Légère d'Afrique, territorial reservists, Senegalese Tirailleurs and goumiers, he switched from the offensive to a long-term strategy of [...] "active defence". [...] Lyautey withdrew all non-essential personnel from his rear garrisons, brought in elderly reservists from France and issued weapons and elements of military dress to civilians in an attempt to convince the tribes that the French army in Morocco was as strong as before. [...] Lyautey referred to this move as similar to hollowing out a lobster while leaving the shell intact. His plan depended on holding a [...] "living barricade" [...] of French outposts running from Taza in the north through Khenifra, Kasbah Tadla and Marrakesh to Agadir on the Atlantic coast.|$|E

500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend for all these years. It had been like an old dog, sleeping comfortably at <b>our</b> <b>feet,</b> and then one day it jumped up and bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do we put it to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under <b>our</b> <b>feet.</b> I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
500|$|... "Clumsy" [...] {{was written}} by Talay Riley, Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder and Alex Niceforo, with {{production}} being handled by the latter two; Mischke served as a vocal producer. Spears, Riley, Felder, Zaire Koalo, Trevor Brown and Mischke provided crowd vocals on the track, which were recorded at 158 Studios, Westlake Village, California, and at House of Blues Studio, Encino, California. Musically, [...] "Clumsy" [...] portrays a [...] "synth-laden" [...] electro track, with a [...] "folksy verse stomp" [...] and a [...] "futuristic club beat." [...] It additionally incorporates [...] "stomping drums and finger snaps" [...] in its instrumentation, as well as doo-wop [...] "hand-claps and soulful vocal riffs as it builds to an explosive electronic drop." [...] In an interview with radio show The Cooper Lawrence Show, the singer confirmed {{that she and her}} team [...] "literally went into the booth together and did all the claps [...] all the sound effects are real, they're from us, <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> and everything, it's all real, so we all did it together, it's like very old-school." [...] Joey Nolfi, writing for Entertainment Weekly, saw [...] "Clumsy" [...] as being [...] " [...] sonically in-line with songs heard on 2011's Femme Fatale and 2013's Britney Jean."

500|$|Madonna also enlisted male models Brad Alphonso, Jon Kortajarena, Rob Evans, Sean O'Pry and Simon Nessman. In the video, Madonna {{sported a}} {{brassiere}} designed by Agent Provocateur. The singer's stilettos, which were custom-made by footwear designer Paola Bay, consisted of black silk embroidered with silver threading. [...] "She wanted them {{as high as}} possible {{and to be able}} to dance with them on," [...] stated Bay. [...] "We did three fittings to make sure they were like second skin." [...] Arianne Phillips, dress designer for the video, recalled that she had to create custom-made high-heeled stilettos for Kazaky, because of unavailability of shoes in their size. Artur Gaspar from the band recalled that [...] "By the end of the day on set, <b>our</b> <b>feet</b> were bleeding and we had blisters... But if Madonna can repeat the dancing for the 50th time, why can't we?" [...] Phillips explained that they had created three different looks for Madonna in the video. The first was called a [...] "super vixen" [...] look for which she created short tops that could be worn as brassiere. Hairstylist Andy Lecompte wanted to go for a 1960s style with it. The second look portrayed was called [...] "rockstar" [...] for which designer Michael Smith created T-shirts out of metal mesh, while Lecompte cut the singer's hair short, so that it would resemble her early look. The final look was called the [...] "platinum bombshell", and was inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E
500|$|Natalie Finn from E! Online was {{disappointed}} with the track, feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that [...] "catchy", {{all of them were}} about the same subject of [...] "the importance of being ourselves. Oh well, maybe we're just waiting for the next 'Bad Romance' to sweep us off <b>our</b> <b>feet.</b> Or the next 'Speechless' to make us cry. Or even the next 'Just Dance' to really make us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality. According to Los Angeles Times Randall Roberts, Gaga [...] "celebrates her follicles" [...] in the song.|$|E
