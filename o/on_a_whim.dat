Butler is revealed as a demon, capable of changing form <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> She later reappears as a succubus, sexually assaulting Black in his sleep to frame him for rape and (as a large snake) trying to kill Emma Hollis.

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), a young {{reporter}} for the Washington Herald who is stuck covering trivial “human interest” stories, pays a late-night visit to Frank at his home. She offers to be Frank’s undercover mouthpiece in the press {{in exchange for the}} elevated profile that she would gain from breaking substantive stories. Meanwhile, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), a young, inexperienced congressman from Philadelphia, is arrested for drunk driving. Stamper finds out about the arrest and immediately contacts the D.C. police commissioner, offering Underwood’s support for his mayoral campaign in exchange for releasing Russo and completely covering up the incident. Russo is picked up from jail by his secretary and romantic partner, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly). He lies to her, telling her that he was alone when he was arrested when, in fact, there was a prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) in the car.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger {{describe}} Caligula as {{an insane}} emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> and indulged {{in too much}} spending and sex. He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it, killing for mere amusement, deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation, and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship. Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the audience into the arena during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts {{because there were no}} prisoners to be used and he was bored.|$|E

50|$|After 18 studio albums, Fahey {{released}} this live album from {{a concert in}} Tasmania, set up, according to the original liner notes, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> drunken <b>whim.</b> It was recorded on four days' notice at the University of Tasmania in 1980 when Fahey was touring Australia.|$|R
50|$|Although the Spanish {{hierarchy}} {{considered the}} missions temporary ventures, individual settlement development was not based simply <b>on</b> <b>a</b> priestly <b>whim.</b> The founding of a mission followed long-standing rules and procedures. The paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded {{the attention of}} virtually every level of the Spanish bureaucracy.|$|R
5|$|On 19November 1932, Lerew enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, {{known as}} the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He had marched into Victoria Barracks <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim</b> and asked to see the person in charge of Air Force recruiting. He was shown {{to the office of}} Squadron Leader Raymond Brownell, also a former Scotch College boy, who {{admitted}} him. Lerew undertook flying instruction on the 1933 'B'course conducted by No.1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, and was commissioned a pilot officer on 1April. He transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force on 20May 1935, following graduation from university, and was promoted flying officer on 1July. Posted to No.1 Aircraft Depot, he was raised to probationary flight lieutenant in 1936. The rank became substantive the following year, when he was appointed Staff Officer Directorate of Works and Buildings at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, responsible for selection and improvement of airfield sites.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

Cowboys working for Abe McQuown (Tom Drake) often come into town to shoot the place up, kill <b>on</b> just <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> beating or humiliating any deputy sheriff who tries {{to stand up to}} them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell (Henry Fonda), a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway (Wallace Ford) who insists that the {{situation}} should be handled within the law (though a loophole prevents it from being done effectively).|$|R

Lee explained that [...] "Sophie's in a lot a pain and just wants to keep dancing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> glass floor".|$|R
5000|$|Much as Wright liked White, he {{felt his}} move to MI6 was a mistake for both MI5 and MI6: [...] "Just as his work MI5 was beginning, he was moved <b>on</b> <b>a</b> politician's <b>whim</b> to <b>an</b> {{organization}} he knew little about, and which was profoundly hostile to his arrival. He was never to be as successful there {{as he had been}} in MI5." [...] He was appointed Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 1956 {{in the wake of the}} [...] "Crabb Affair", the exposure of which had damaged Soviet-British relations and embarrassed MI6.|$|R

25|$|Nivek Ogre as Pavi Largo, Rotti's middle child. Womanizing, narcissistic, vacuous, and effeminate, {{he wears}} the skinned {{face of a}} woman as a mask over his own, which is heavily scarred. Due to the way his face is attached, {{he is able to}} change faces <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> He has an Italian accent (to conceal his speech impediment, {{according}} to Zdunich) and is almost always surrounded by women, usually Genterns, the employees of GeneCo, who usually give Pavi his face surgeries.|$|E
50|$|One day in 2011, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{spontaneous}} <b>whim,</b> {{her husband}} asked {{a friend to}} help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode {{of the process of}} house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape of the flip was sent to a production company without anyone really believing that it would be of much interest to them, but instead the production company, Pie Town Productions, loved it. HGTV producers had also noticed the couple’s instagram profile, which featured before and after profiles of many of the renovation projects they had undertaken.|$|R

25|$|Julia {{escapes from}} reality by marrying men <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim</b> and then abandoning them when things {{do not work}} out. She then runs home and wants to crawl back into the womb. She has not evolved into a mature woman {{although}} she is in her mid-thirties, she would rather go home to her parents and reclaim the room in which she grew up. Her energies are used in fighting for her right to return home rather than in fighting {{for a life of}} her own.|$|E
25|$|One {{highlight}} of the estate is the outdoor Neptune Pool, located {{near the edge of}} the hilltop, which offers an expansive vista of the mountains, ocean and the main house. Due to drought conditions and leaks in the pool, it is now drained. The Neptune Pool patio features an ancient Roman temple front, transported wholesale from Europe and reconstructed at the site. Hearst was an inveterate tinkerer, and would tear down structures and rebuild them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim.</b> For example, the Neptune Pool was rebuilt three times before Hearst was satisfied. As a consequence of Hearst's persistent design changes, the estate was never completed in his lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Seeking revenge, {{the hero}} leaves the {{destroyed}} village behind and soon realizes that this cowardly attack did not just happen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> corrupt king's <b>whim.</b> An evil power lies {{waiting at the}} threshold of this world, and our hero will need to face this nameless evil. Yet the hero is not alone - his fate is linked to that of a beautiful, mysterious lady as well as a powerful artifact from the long-forgotten distant past.|$|R
5000|$|In modern times, {{diplomatic}} immunity continues {{to provide a}} means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: [...] "So why do we agree to {{a system in which}} we're dependent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> foreign country's <b>whim</b> before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs." ...|$|R
50|$|Worship of {{food and}} {{offering}} of food, is highly praised in Hinduism and hence Annapurna {{is regarded as a}} popular deity. As per legend-Annapurna fed the whole world along with her consort Shiva, who was begging for food <b>on</b> account of <b>a</b> <b>whim</b> created by her. Annapurna is usually depicted as a youthful goddess having red complexion with a face round like full moon, three eyes, high breasts and four hands. Though Annapurna is a popular deity, there are few temples dedicated to her, the most prominent being the Annapurna Devi Mandir and the Kasi Viswanath Temple in Varanasi. She is glorified in various sacred and religious literature from the Vedic period with mention in religious texts like Rudrayamala, Sivarahasya, Annapurnamantratsava, Maha Tripurasiddhanta, Annapurna Kavacha, Annapurnahavamti, Annapurnamalininaksatramalika and Bhairvahyantantra.|$|R
25|$|Upon his {{discharge}} in 1946, Altman {{moved to}} California. He worked in publicity {{for a company}} that had invented a tattooing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> selling a script to RKO for the 1948 picture Bodyguard, which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to New York City, where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the Calvin Company. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, Modern Football (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E

While in Paris, Maggie and Bianca become lovers, as revealed by Bianca in her Christmas 2005 visit to Pine Valley.|$|E
5000|$|Famous {{buildings}} on the street are the Bank of Greece building, and the Old Parliament. Klafthmonos Square is a square that is located off {{the central part of}} this street; its name literally means [...] "Lamentation Square" [...] (from Κλαυθμών, Klafthmōn, weeping or lamentation) and the Ministry of the Interior is located by it. In the 19th century, Greek public servants were not permanent but could be hired or sacked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> minister's <b>whim.</b> Following each election, they would gather at this square in order {{to find out what the}} election results were: in case of victory of a party other than the one that hired them, they would lament their impending unemployment. Abiding with the aforementioned tradition of downtown Athens, Klafthmonos Square was officially renamed [...] "National Reconciliation Square" [...] but retains its popular name in almost every context.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not known}} when these songs were {{actually}} written, {{but none of them}} have turned up in the dozens of basement recordings that have since surfaced.

25|$|Author Hristo Stoyanov {{has been}} {{critical}} of the tendency to impute false intellectualism to some of those engaging in legal transgressions as a way of protest, seeing the methods employed by the protesters between 23 and 24 July 2013 {{as a threat to the}} fundamentals of Bulgarian democracy. Analyst Petar Klisarov has voiced his disapproval of the demonstrators (especially the emigrant students who participated in protests on 26 December 2013 and 3 January 2014) for flaunting Bulgarian legal regulations, for example by behaving disrespectfully towards police officers and blocking the city traffic <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> suggesting that they would have been much more disciplined and law-abiding if the activities were taking place abroad. Sofia mayor Yordanka Fandakova is also claimed to have been overly permissive of the demonstrators at the expense of the other members of society.|$|E
25|$|Young Roy Radabaugh, as he {{was then}} known, had just two days in film extra work on the side, and {{can be seen in}} King of Jazz (1930), along with the film's star, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim,</b> friends {{encouraged}} Roy to audition in 1930 for the remake of the Richard Barthelmess silent: Tol'able David (1930). Radabaugh won the role over thousands of hopefuls, and in storybook fashion, Harry Cohn gave him his screen name and launched his career. Cromwell earned $75 per week for his work on Tol'able David. Noah Beery Sr. and John Carradine co-starred in the film. Later, Cohn signed Cromwell to a multi-year contract based on the strength of his performance and success in his first venture at the box-office. Amidst the flurry of publicity during this period, Cromwell toured the country, even meeting President Herbert Hoover in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|During the 1840s, {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} went into depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of the felt hat industry came in the 1850s, once again <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whim</b> of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the felt hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E
