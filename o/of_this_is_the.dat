5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists {{working in this}} field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the {{psychology of}} forms says that objects that move {{in the same direction}} are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Like Profit making organisations, nonprofits {{and governments}} will produce Consolidated Financial Statements. These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the reporting requirements in the country they are based or if they are large enough they may produce them under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), an example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E

50|$|Donald Healey {{became a}} {{director}} of Jensen Motors in the late 1960s and a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Lotus-engined Jensen-Healey which appeared in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> gate to {{the huge}} {{recreational}} area in the city: The Gorkij Park, the memorial for Maksim Gorkij and the sports arena Spartak.|$|R
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E
50|$|Captive {{butterfly}} breeding {{has been}} used to replenish extirpated populations of butterflies. One example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> commercial breeding <b>of</b> the Florida keys species butterfly by butterfly breeder Fort Lauderdale.|$|R
50|$|Folding a paper {{more than}} once in the same {{direction}} (i.e. with parallel creases) is called parallel folding. Common examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> half fold, letter fold, gate fold, and Z-fold.|$|R
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, a {{more militant}} brand of Rastafari emerged. <b>The</b> vanguard <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Youth Black Faith, a group whose members were largely based in West Kingston.|$|R
5|$|The theatre also hosts {{a variety}} of special events, and offers a number of {{education}} and outreach programs to school-age children and adults reaching over 61,000 students, professional performers, and audiences each year. One example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 5th Avenue High School Musical Theatre Awards which evaluate and honor the performances of student actors and stage hands in Washington state high school productions. At {{the end of each}} school year, a Tony Awards-style ceremony is held which includes high-profile presenters, performances by nominees, and acceptance speeches by the award recipients. The awards ceremony has become a useful scouting event for colleges looking to recruit talent for their drama departments.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> chilling of the young.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E
2500|$|Timber {{exports from}} the U.S. {{occupation}} zone were particularly heavy. Sources in the U.S. government stated that <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ultimate {{destruction of the}} war potential of German forests." ...|$|R
50|$|Human {{presence}} {{in the area of}} Montelupo dates back to the Palaeolithic era. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> many prehistoric sites which have <b>been</b> identified in <b>the</b> last twenty years, in the municipal area.|$|R
50|$|Gorynova {{expanded}} {{the scope of}} the rules to include ternary compounds where the average number of valence electrons per atom <b>was</b> four. Examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> I-IV2-V3 CuGe2P3 compound which has a zincblende structure.|$|R
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
50|$|Balancanché <b>was</b> {{known to}} <b>the</b> Mayans {{as early as}} the pre-classical period, 3,000 years ago. <b>The</b> cave <b>was</b> a source of water and because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> object <b>of</b> worship to the god of rain, Chaac.|$|R
5|$|Since its {{dismissal}} several Ministers of {{the second}} Tymoshenko Government {{have been involved in}} criminal proceedings against them; the most noticeable outcomes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> imprisonments <b>of</b> former Prime Minister Tymoshenko and Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko.|$|R

5|$|The prehistoric {{period of}} Jordan ended at around 2000 BC when the Semitic nomads {{known as the}} Amorites entered the region. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age, present-day Jordan was home to several ancient kingdoms, whose populations spoke Semitic {{languages}} of the Canaanite group. Among them were Ammon, Edom and Moab, which are described as tribal kingdoms rather than states. They are mentioned in ancient texts such as the Old Testament. Archaeological finds have shown that Ammon was {{in the area of}} the modern city of Amman, Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea and Edom in the area around Wadi Araba. These Transjordanian kingdoms were in continuous conflict with the neighbouring Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah, centered west of the Jordan River, though the former was known to have at times controlled small parts east of the River. Frequent confrontations ensued and tensions between them increased. One record <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mesha Stele erected by the Moabite king Mesha in around 840 BC on which he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the Israelites. The stele constitutes one of the most important direct accounts of Biblical history. Subsequently, the Assyrian Empire reduced these kingdoms to vassals. When the region was later under the influence of the Babylonians, the Old Testament mentions that these kingdoms aided them in the 597 BC sack of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparent}} {{difference of}} interests between Przemysł II and his uncle Bolesław the Pious in the Silesian and Czech affairs, didn't disturb their good relations. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> common issuance <b>of</b> documents, such as 6 January 1278.|$|R
30|$|Each type of norm regularizer {{has its own}} strong points, and the {{combination}} of them through the generic form J(V) (9) is expected to obtain better performance. Two typical variants <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> elastic net[17] and sparse group lasso (SGL)[18].|$|R
50|$|After the {{dissolution}} of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the formation of independent Slovakia motivated interest in a particularly Slovak national identity.
