5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> {{force behind the}} name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused by the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E

5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} {{scenes were}} due to be filmed in co-operation with the Swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. The final result {{was a combination of}} a man-made avalanche at an isolated Swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. Lazenby and Rigg did most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
5|$|Thomas is also speculated to {{have been}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> forces behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} {{that took place in}} 1240. The speculation is based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E

5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|Negro {{became one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded {{with the top}} técnicos of AAA such as La Parka, Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's {{position}} as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading {{to a series of}} matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka, Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octagón and La Parka, Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.|$|E
