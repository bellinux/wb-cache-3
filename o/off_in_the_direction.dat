5|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his {{scouting}} frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was Audacieux, of Nielly's squadron. Pursuing Audacieux after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun Républicaine and 16-gun Inconnue. Continuing his chase {{over the next three}} days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.|$|E
5|$|The German {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of Poland were conceived under the codename Fall Weiss (Case White). This operation called for simultaneous attacks on Poland from three directions, the north, {{the west and the}} south, beginning at 04:45 on the early morning of 1 September 1939. On this morning Helmut Lent, with Kubisch as his wireless operator and rear gunner, escorted a formation of Heinkel 111 bombers of I. and III./Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG4) attacking the airfields at Krakow in support of the southern prong of the German attack. At 16:30 on 2 September 1939, {{the second day of the}} German attack, Lent took <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Łódź and claimed his first aerial-victory of the war, shooting down a PZL P.11.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of a number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E
25|$|After losing {{very few}} {{men in the}} action, the Calabrians under Colonel Carey retreated to the northwest. During the night, they ran into the head of Decaen's column and had to quickly reverse course to the south. After passing behind Suchet's {{advancing}} column, Carey's men reached the coast where they were taken off by Allied shipping, having lost 51 men. Torres' troops and about 150 men of the 27th Foot made <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Sant Sadurni and, from there, reached Vilafranca without incident.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a hunting}} dog that needs {{extensive}} amounts of exercise. Without it, the dog could become problematic for its owners. It {{should be taken}} on walks daily, and this dog is great for healthy people who love to jog and hike. While it can live in an apartment, it may perform better in a small yard. It is important for owners {{to make sure this}} dog is never unleashed in an unsecured area, as it may run <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the first interesting scent it picks up. It is important for owners to make sure these dogs are given lots of space to move around in.|$|E

500|$|Boats from Aigle {{were sent}} after some small craft, {{seen in the}} early hours of 27 November 1804 in the Bay of Gibraltar.

500|$|At 22:30 on 28 November 1942, Kuru {{set sail}} for Betano. Kuru was {{scheduled}} to arrive at approximately 20:30 on 30 November, where she was to unload the supplies on board and embark the Portuguese refugees, which were to transfer to Castlemaine once she arrived along with Armidale two hours later. However, Kuru hit bad weather during her voyage and arrived at Betano three hours late. Armidale—with two Dutch Army officers, 61 Netherlands East Indies troops and three Australian Army soldiers aboard—and Castlemaine set sail from Darwin at 01:42 on 29 November. At approximately 09:15 on 30 November, while [...] from their destination, the two ships were attacked by a single Japanese aircraft. Having missed with several bombs, the aircraft flew <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Timor an hour later. Fearing that their discovery by this aircraft would jeopardise the mission, Castlemaines Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Commander Philip Sullivan, ordered evasive action and signalled Darwin for further orders. A signal returned decreeing that the operation must proceed and a party of fighter aircraft were to be dispatched as protective cover.|$|E
2500|$|Journalists {{from the}} Associated Press in Snizhne, Ukraine {{reported}} seeing a Buk M-1 enter the town {{operated by a}} man [...] "with unfamiliar fatigues and a distinctive Russian accent" [...] escorted by two civilian vehicles, which then moved <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> where the shootdown later occurred. [...] According to Ukrainian counterterrorism chief, Vitaly Nayda, after downing the plane under separatist direction, the launcher's Russian crew quickly moved it back {{across the border into}} Russia.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{campaign}} {{to gain the}} initiative began immediately. On 21 April Comte d'Estrées set <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of Mons with a force of cavalry, while Du Chayla, pursuing a different route, set out {{with the intention of}} uniting with d'Estrées in the vicinity of that town. However, this movement was only a feint to disguise Saxe's real intention of besieging Tournai; it was a deception that had the desired effect on the allied command. [...] "By all the intelligence I have from different parts," [...] wrote Cumberland on 23 April, [...] "the real design of the enemy is to besiege Mons." [...] Adding, [...] "The Marshal Count Saxe is at Maubeuge and is in so low a state that his death is daily expected." ...|$|E
2500|$|They follow young Mr. Cooger to Miss Foley's house, {{where he}} {{pretends to be}} the nephew she was expecting. Jim tries to talk to with him, {{because he wants to}} ride the {{carousel}}, but Will stops him. Jim takes <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of the carnival. When Will catches up, Mr. Cooger is riding the carousel growing older, and Jim is about to join him. Will knocks the switch on the carousel and it flies out of control, spinning rapidly forward. Mr. Cooger ages over 100 years before it stops, and Jim and Will take off. They return with the police, but Mr. Cooger is nowhere to be found. Inside the tents they find him all set up as a new act, [...] "Mr. Electrico", a man they run electricity through. Mr. Dark tells the boys {{to come back to the}} carnival the next day. Will tries to keep his father out of the situation, promising him that he will tell all soon. That night, the Dust Witch floats by in her balloon to find Jim and Will. Will lures her to an abandoned house and destroys her balloon with a bow and arrow. They later both dream of a bizarre funeral for the balloon, featuring a giant, misshapen coffin.|$|E

60|$|She {{turned and}} walked <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} <b>direction,</b> and Mr. Walters, after a moment’s hesitation, turned and followed. They walked in this fashion for some distance; then the boatswain, quickening his pace, caught her roughly by the arm.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Come {{and get a}} banana,' {{said the}} girl. And they went <b>off</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> of <b>the</b> house, leaving Mr Pickering bewildered. Why a banana? Was it a slang term of the underworld for a pistol? It must be that.|$|R
60|$|When {{the hunters}} {{were out of}} sight and hearing, the glover arose, greatly {{relieved}} by their departure, and began to move <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>direction</b> as fast as his age permitted. His first reflection was on the fidelity of the foster father.|$|R
