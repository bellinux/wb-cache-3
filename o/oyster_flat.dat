40|$|International audienceMollusc {{aquaculture}} is {{an important}} commodity for France with Pacific <b>oysters,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> and the great scallop being the three main species. Pacific oyster larvae production is currently successful, however larval production of <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> and scallops regularly face problems remedied by antibiotics. Using a bioassay technique, four potential probiotic strains (Alteromonas macleodii 0444, Neptunomonas sp. 0536, Phaeobacter gallaeciensis, Pseudoaltermonas sp. D 41) were tested upon the larvae of the three mollusc species when challenged with pathogens. Pacific <b>oysters</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> were challenged individually with the pathogens Vibrio coralliilyticus and V. pectenicida, while scallops were challenged with V. coralliilyticus and V. splendidus. Survival of the larvae was measured in challenged larvae given the probiotics and those without probiotic. In scallop larvae, protection against V. coralliilyticus and V. splendidus was provided by prior administration of P. gallaeciensis (29 % and 53 % better than the respective pathogen controls), A. macleodii 0444 (30 %, 36 %) and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 (36 %, 55 %). Significant protection with Pseudoalteromonas sp. D 41 was only provided against V. splendidus (35 %). In <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> larvae, protection against V. coralliilyticus and V. pectenicida was provided by P. gallaeciensis. (73 %, 69 %) and A. macleodii 0444 (45 %, 53 %). Neptunomonas sp. 0536 provided significant protection only against V. pectenicida (48 % higher). Use of Pseudoalteromonas sp.

50|$|Bonamia ostreae is a {{parasitic}} Rhizaria in the phylum Haplosporidia {{that can}} cause lethal infections in shellfish, particularly the European <b>flat</b> <b>oyster,</b> Ostrea edulis.

40|$|Bonamia exitiosa and Bonamia ostreae are parasites that {{reproduce}} {{within the}} haemocytes of several oyster species. In Europe, the host species is the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis.

B. exitiosa was first detected, in 2007, on this continent in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> cultured in Galicia (NW Spain).

The bays of the Ebro Delta in the south of Catalonia represent the main bivalve culture area in the Mediterranean coast of Spain.

40|$|Apoptosis is a {{fundamental}} feature {{in the development of}} many organisms and tissue systems. It is also a mechanism of host defense against environmental stress factors or pathogens by contributing to the elimination of infected cells.

However this phenomenon has rarely been investigated in bivalves especially in the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis. The apoptotic response of hemocytes from <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> O. edulis, was investigated after exposure to UV and dexamethasone, two agents known to induce apoptosis in vertebrates.

We analyzed histopathological data from annual shellfish disease monitoring from 1988 to 2006 to quantify prevalence of B. ostreae in <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> stocks of the marine Lake Grevelingen. In addition, we estimated prevalence of B. ostreae on a monthly basis with field surveys in 2003. The parasite was detected with PCR, using specific primers for B. ostreae. Prevalence of B. ostreae was analyzed relative to O. edulis density, biomass and a range of environmental parameters. B. ostreae was detected in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring than in autumn, possibly due to termination of spawning and the onset of oyster growth in autumn. Although B. ostreae was detected in all oyster weight classes, prevalence was highest in the largest oysters in spring and declined disproportionately in autumn, possibly due to high mortality of large oysters before autumn, suggesting that prevalence depends on oyster age. Parasite prevalence was independent of oyster density and total biomass, but appeared to be higher after a warm autumn. Abundance of the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (infected or non-infected with B. ostreae) was negatively related to the temperature of the preceding period, suggesting that mortality in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> increased at higher water temperatures. Furthermore, O. edulis appeared to be more susceptible to B. ostreae after years with lower food availability and lower salinities (< 29. 5). B. ostreae may weaken the competitive ability of O. edulis relative to the introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, particularly in years with high water temperatures. ...|$|R

However the development ofthis activity can be limited by infectious diseases (virus, protozoan or bacteria). <b>Flat</b> <b>oysters</b> suffered from two epizooties caused by two parasitic di seases: martieilliosis and the bonamiosis. These diseases appeared {{at the end of}} the Sixties and Seventies respectively. These diseases had a negative impact on the economy because they decrease the production of <b>Flat</b> <b>oysters</b> by 90 % between 1979 and. 1980. [Buestel 2004, Grizel 1985] The means of fights against bonamiosis are limited and mainly rely on a preventive approach. In fact, it is impossible to use the vaccination especially because they do not have abodes. But it is also impossible to use treatments for invertebrate because they are product in open systems on the wild. The bonamiosis is a notifiable disease listed by the The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as weil as by European Union. That implies a surveillance of stocks and restrictions of transfer in order to avoid the contamination of healthy zones free. In addition another approach is based on the obtention of resistant animaIs through a genetic selection. Thanks to that it is possible to obtain a better rate of survival in the zones where the parasite is endemic [Naciri et Al.; 1998]. In this context, a better understanding of defence mechanisms developed by the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> against parasite and interaction between oyster and parasite is needed.

Poseban je naglasak stavljen na prikaz mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja školjkaša u bočatim vodama ušća. U ušću rijeke Krke utvrđeno je 56 svojti iz 27 porodica. Najrasprostranjenije su ove svojte: dagnja (Mytilus galloprovincialis), kamenica (Ostrea edulis), a česte su: jestiva srčanka (Cerastoderma glaucum), prnjavica (Venus verrucosa), kućica (Tapes decussatus), kunjka (Arca noae), mala kapica (Chlamys varia) i jakovska kapica (Pecten jacobaeus). Izlov prirodnih populacija školjkaša za prehranu tradicionalna je djelatnost i procjenjuje se na 100 tona u godini. Istraživanja mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja dagnje, kamenice, male kapice i jakovske kapice rezultirala su razvojem tehnologija konroliranog uzgoja dagnje i kamenice 1983., a jakovske kapice i male kapice godine 1989. Danas je proizvodnja organizirana na 25 lokaliteta, ukupne površine 87. 142 m 2, s mogućnošću proizvodnje oko 1. 500 tona dagnji i deset tisuća kamenica, a mogla bi se povećati iznad 10. 000 tona. Krka River {{spring is}} {{at the foot of}} Dinara mountain, {{starting}} from a 22 m high Topoljski waterfall. Its length is 72. 5 km, and total slope 242 m. The length of freshwater waterway is 49 km and brackish waterway, i. e. flooded river mouth, 23. 5 km long. Impact of seawater and depth of surface fresh water greatly vary depending on the river waterlevel, local precipitation, tides and wind directions. Owing to the extensive primary production in the river mouth shellfish are abundantly present with 56 species. The most abundant are Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprouincialis) and <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostrea edulis), and partly common cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), Venus shell (Venus verucosa), calico clam (Tapes decussates), Noah 2 ̆ 7 s arc (Arca noae), variegated scallop (Chlamis uaria) and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (Pecten jacobaeus). Owing to very productive processes in the ecosystem of river mouth, fishing in the area is traditionally practice. The knowledge about natural populations of Mediterranean mussel fished out in quantities larger than 100 t/y have initiated the research on since 1979 shellfish in this area. Investigations on possibilities of commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel, <b>flat</b> <b>oyster,</b> variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) resulted in defining the technological procedure for commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel and <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (1983), and variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (1989). Nowadays at 25 localities of 87. 000 m 2 area and with 19 concessions a total production around 1500 t/y of Mediterranean mussel and about 10. 000 pieces of <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> is provided, and there is also significant possibility to increase production up to 10. 000 tons...|$|R
