5|$|In {{medieval times}} the {{township}} {{was within the}} manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The earliest surviving <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to {{the lord of the}} manor, Thomas de Derwentwater. The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly to Adam de Derwentwater before 1216, and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage. The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of James Radclyffe, third Earl of Derwentwater, in 1716 for his part in the Jacobite rebellion the previous year. In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the Greenwich Hospital, London. Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital's forestry and farming estates until the 19th century. In 1925 the then owner, Sir John Randles, gave the National Trust 90 acres of land in this estate, including the foreshore woodland.|$|E
5|$|Charles Spencer Chaplin {{was born}} on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> his birth, {{although}} Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At {{the time of his}} birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.|$|E

25|$|Documents {{indicate}} that Teignmouth {{was a significant}} port by the early 14th century, second in Devon only to Dartmouth. It was attacked by the French in 1340 and sent seven ships and 120 men to the expedition against Calais in 1347. Its relative importance waned during the 15th century, {{and it did not}} figure in an <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 1577. This may have been due to silting up of the harbour caused by tin mining on Dartmoor.|$|E

25|$|The flag {{consists}} of a defaced British Blue Ensign with the state badge located in the fly. The badge is a white disk with a red lion passant in {{the centre of the}} disk. There is no <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> how the lion came to be included on the flag. Where this design originated from is unknown, but it is assumed that the red lion is a link with England. This flag has remained almost unchanged since 1875, with only a slight change of the style of the lion when the flag was officially adopted by the government in 1975, although this was a mistake, as it had already been officially gazetted by the colonial government in 1876.|$|E
25|$|During the Yalta Conference on 4 February, the Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, General Aleksei Antonov, {{raised the}} issue of hampering the {{reinforcement}} of German troops from the western front by paralysing the junctions of Berlin and Leipzig with aerial bombardment. In response, Chief of the British Air Staff Portal, who was in Yalta, asked Bottomley to send him a list of objectives to discuss with the Soviets. Bottomley's list included oil plants, tank and aircraft factories and the cities of Berlin and Dresden. A British interpreter later claimed that Antonov and Joseph Stalin asked for the bombing of Dresden, but {{there is no mention of}} these requests in the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> the conference and the claim was assessed as possible Cold War propaganda.|$|E

25|$|Members of the President's {{security}} detail {{were attempting to}} remove Kennedy's body from the hospital when they briefly scuffled with Dallas officials, including Dallas County Coroner Earl Rose, who believed that he was legally obligated to perform an autopsy before Kennedy's body was removed. The Secret Service pushed through and Rose eventually stepped aside. The forensic panel of the HSCA, of which Rose was a member, later reported that Texas law indicated {{that it was the}} responsibility of the justice of the peace to determine the cause of death as well as the necessity of whether an autopsy was needed to determine the cause of death. Theran Ward, a justice of the peace in Dallas County, signed the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> inquest as well as a second certificate of death.|$|E
25|$|An 18-year-old diver from Scarborough, Ontario {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. He had been swimming for 10 minutes, before approaching the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother tried to help him, but was pulled underwater several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's Director of Engineering denied the pond had an undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied to a tree with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach {{the middle of the}} pool. A high diver who worked at the park for seven years said he told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. He claimed unauthorized swimmers frequently used the pond, and that there were 30 to 40 at one time. The park's Director of Safety and Security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool once. The previous Director also denied hearing a complaint, and no <b>official</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> it exists. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Wonderland said the man shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area.|$|E
