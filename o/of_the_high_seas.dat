5|$|Both ships served during World War I.

5|$|Moltke was {{surrendered}} {{with the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at Scapa Flow, {{under the command of}} Kapitänleutnant Wollante.

The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Reinhard Scheer (30 September 1863 – 26 November 1928) was an Admiral in the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). Scheer {{joined the}} navy in 1879 {{as an officer}} cadet; he progressed through the ranks, {{commanding}} cruisers and battleships, as well as major staff positions on land. At the outbreak of World War I, Scheer was {{the commander of the}} II Battle Squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet. He then took command of the III Battle Squadron, which consisted of the newest and most powerful battleships in the navy. In January 1916, he was promoted to Admiral and given control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet. Scheer led the German fleet at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916, one of the largest naval battles in history.|$|E

5|$|Von der Tann {{also participated}} in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, on 15–16December. The raid was another attempt to lure out {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet {{standing}} by in support. Von der Tann delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth the IScouting Group at anything less than full strength, and Von der Tann was undergoing routine repairs in early December. The I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two torpedo boat flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef light vessel, at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast. The main battle squadrons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet left in the late afternoon of the 15th. During the night of 15 December, the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet encountered British destroyers, and fearing the prospect of a night-time torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with almost all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Hipper {{organized}} {{the office of}} Befehlshabers der Sicherung der Nordsee (BSNCommander of the Defense of the North Sea), which was also stationed on Niobe. In 1917, she was disarmed so her guns {{could be used to}} reinforce the defenses of Wilhelmshaven. In October that year, Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker, then the commander of the I Squadron, came aboard Niobe; the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet had gone into the Baltic to launch Operation Albion, and Boedicker temporarily took control of the BSN. Hipper and his staff left Niobe on 11 August 1918, having been promoted to command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet. The BSN remained aboard Niobe until January 1919, two months after the war ended with the Armistice; it was then transferred to the old pre-dreadnought battleship , also in use as a headquarters ship. Niobe was then decommissioned on 3 February.|$|E

5|$|Pommern was {{assigned}} to the II Battle Squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet alongside her sisters. She took part in the annual training cruises and maneuvers with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet between 1908 and 1914. This included fleet training in the Baltic in 1908 and a cruise into the Atlantic the following year. In May 1910 Pommern took part in fleet training in the Kattegat between Denmark and Norway, followed by a cruise to Norway in the summer. At the end of 1910, the fleet conducted another cruise into the Baltic. The next two years followed a similar pattern, though the summer cruise in 1912 was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise was only into the Baltic. Later in the year Pommern took part in maneuvers off the island of Helgoland in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|The German Navy {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast {{in an attempt to}} draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was later devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment, while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet stationed itself east of Dogger Bank, so they could cover the battlecruisers' return and destroy any pursuing British vessels. Having broken the German naval codes, the British were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet's presence. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS (now reduced to four ships, including New Zealand) and the 2nd Battle Squadron (consisting of six dreadnoughts) were detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As {{they were the}} oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the sunken ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Pétain {{counted on}} the rivalry between de Laborde and Admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet François Darlan to keep control. Darlan had been Admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fleet. As a vice-admiral, Laborde was chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Squadron, {{organised}} around the battleship Strasbourg. After <b>the</b> Fall <b>of</b> France and <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> Vichy France, Laborde supported the regime, and was made chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>sea</b> fleet by Philippe Pétain, who counted on using Laborde's dislike of Darlan {{to make the}} Fleet easier to manage. <b>The</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet was composed of 38 modern units and amounting to a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total French fleet.|$|R

5|$|After the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations.

Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.|$|E

After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to the Brazilian Government, she was listed for disposal in April 1921, but was used for experimental purposes later that year. She was sold for scrap on 19December 1922 to comply with the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was not actually broken up until the end of 1924.|$|E
5|$|Ariadne {{served with}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> Fleet {{for the majority of}} her career.

On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, a pair of battlecruisers attacked and sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors were pulled from the sea.|$|E
