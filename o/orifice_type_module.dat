40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the morphology of pulp chamber floors in mandibular second molars with a C-shaped canal system. Forty-four extracted mandibular second molars with C-shaped roots were collected from a native Chinese population. After the teeth were scanned by the micro-computed tomography (μCT), the pulp chamber floors were reconstructed three-dimensionally using three-dimensional software. The reconstructed images were classified into four types based on the shape of the pulp chamber floor and the location of the dentin fusion between the peninsular-like floor and the pulp chamber wall. Of the 44 reconstructed pulpal floors, 38 (86. 37 %) were C-shaped (peninsula-like floor) in which 8 (18. 18 %) had a continuous C-shaped <b>orifice</b> (<b>type</b> I); 16 (36. 37 %) had a dentin fusion between the peninsula-like floor and buccal pulp chamber wall, forming one or two mesial orifice(s) and a distal <b>orifice</b> (<b>type</b> II); and 14 (31. 82 %) had a dentin fusion between the peninsula-like floor and the mesial pulp chamber wall, forming a large mesiobuccal-distal (MB-D) orifice and a small mesiolingual <b>orifice</b> (<b>type</b> III). Six (13. 63 %) teeth did not have a C-shaped floor configuration (type IV). The number and configuration of the canals at different levels below the orifices were analyzed. The results suggested that most teeth in this study with C-shaped roots also have a C-shaped pulpal floor and that a new classification of pulpal floor anatomy would be helpful in locating the C-shaped canals. © 2006 American Association of Endodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

DBDN (Di n-butyl dodecandioate) {{is a kind of}} EHD fluid and a dielectric organic liquid. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a lightweight and compact fluid actuator which makes use of such properties of EHD fluid. We think that it is useful to apply EHD actuators to an industrial robot as a lightweight actuator. In order to develop such an actuator, we first investigated the characteristics, the relation between the generated pressure and applied voltage to DBDN fluid. In this study, we tested two kinds of pumping module; direct type and suction type. The direct <b>type</b> <b>module</b> consists of two doughnut shaped electrodes. The suction <b>type</b> <b>module</b> consists of a flat plate electrode and a cylindrical electrode. We investigated the relation between applied voltage and generated differential pressure using these modules. Further, we investigated the influence of geometric parameters on the characteristics of the module. As a result of the experiment, It was found that the suction type was able to generate much higher differential pressure, more than 320 times, compared with the direct <b>type</b> <b>module.</b> It was observed that the maximum differential pressure was 3. 6 kPa when the voltage of 10 kV was applied by using the one-stage suction <b>type</b> <b>module.</b> It will be possible to construct a fluid pump without any mechanical moving parts using the suction <b>type</b> <b>module...</b>|$|R

Furthermore, the object modules represent the concept of encapsulated entities that possess an internal state and provide the exterior with various services. For this second sort of modules, an algebraic net formalism has been adopted. Algebraic Petri nets, a kind of high level nets, are a great improvement over the Petri nets, i.e. Petri nets tokens are replaced with data structures which are described by means of algebraic abstract data types. For managing visibility, both abstract data <b>type</b> <b>modules</b> and object modules are composed of an interface (which allows some operations to be visible from the outside) and a body (which mainly encapsulates the operations properties and some operation which are used for building the model).

In this paper analysis of <b>orifice</b> <b>type</b> pulse tube refrigerator (OPTR) systems operating {{under a variety of}} thermal boundary conditions are modeled at different frequencies. The compressor used is having dual opposed piston arrangement. The simulations are done at different frequencies with helium as working fluid. The simulated OPTR consists of a compressor (dual opposed piston), a transfer line, an after cooler, a regenerator, a pulse tube, a pair of heat exchangers for cold and hot end, an orifice valve and a reservoir. The simulation represents fully coupled systems operating in steady-periodic mode. The externally imposed boundary conditions are a cyclically moving piston wall {{at one end of the}} tube and constant temperature or heat flux boundaries at the external walls of the hot end and cold end heat exchangers. The experimental method to evaluate the optimum parameters of OPTR is difficult. On the other hand, developing a computer code for CFD analysis is equally complex.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Titin {{is a huge}} protein (∼ 3 MDa) that {{is present}} in the {{contractile}} unit (sarcomere) of striated muscle and has a key role in muscle assembly and elasticity. Titin is mainly composed of two <b>types</b> of <b>module</b> (<b>type</b> I and II). <b>Type</b> I <b>modules</b> are found exclusively in the region of titin localised in the A band, where they are arranged in a super-repeat pattern that correlates with the ultrastructure of the thick filament. No structure of a titin <b>type</b> I <b>module</b> has been reported so far. Results: We have determined the structure of a representative <b>type</b> I <b>module,</b> A 71, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure has the predicted fibronectin type III fold. Titin-specific conserved residues are either located at the putative module–module interfaces or along one side of the protein surface. Several proline residues that contribute to two stretches in a polyproline II helix conformation are solvent-exposed and line up as a continuous ribbon extending over {{more than two-thirds of the}} module surface. Homology models of the <b>type</b> I <b>module</b> N-terminal to A 71 (A 70) and the double module A 70 –A 71 were used to discuss possible intermodule interactions and their role in module–module orientation. Conclusions: As residues at the module–module interfaces are highly conserved, we speculate that similar interactions govern all of the interfaces between <b>type</b> I <b>modules</b> in titin. This conservation would lead to a regular multiple array of similar surface structures. Such an arrangement would allow arrays of contiguous <b>type</b> I <b>modules</b> to expose multiple proline stretches in a highly regular way and these may act as binding sites for other thick filament proteins...|$|R
