5|$|In the ALCS Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Rays, the Red Sox {{were down}} by seven {{runs in the}} bottom of the seventh inning.

5|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1990s, the two teams were seldom equally good.

50|$|The game wasn't crisp defensively, {{as there}} were six errors, five <b>of</b> them by <b>the</b> NL. All four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL's</b> runs in <b>the</b> first inning were unearned.|$|R

5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Al</b> Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals did {{finish in}} last place of the NL East in 1990. However, the Atlanta Braves of the NL West had a worse record. The next longest streak is by the Cincinnati Reds, who most {{recently}} finished {{in last place}} of the NL in 1982. The similar streak in the American League is held by the Boston Red Sox, who last finished in last place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> in 1932.|$|E

This review article is formatted {{as a series of}} fundamental questions and explores <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Als</b> proteins, as well as their role in ligand binding, aggregative effects, and attachment to abiotic surfaces. Interaction of Als proteins with each other, their functional equivalence, and <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> protein abundance on phenotypic conclusions are also examined. Structural features of Als proteins that may facilitate invasive function are considered. Conclusions that are firmly supported by the literature are presented while highlighting areas that require additional investigation to reveal basic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Als</b> proteins, their relatedness to each other, and their roles in C. albicans biology...|$|R

5|$|Kelley {{moved back}} to the infield, {{becoming}} the regular first baseman in 1901. After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the Superbas to <b>the</b> Detroit Tigers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American League (<b>AL),</b> <b>the</b> former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after <b>the</b> <b>AL's</b> successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to <b>the</b> Baltimore Orioles <b>AL.</b> Kelley's father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal share holder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL's</b> Orioles.|$|R

5|$|Under the Ayyubids, {{numerous}} Arab emirs {{held the}} post {{at any given}} time and were endowed with iqtaʿat. However, with the onset of Mamluk rule in Syria in 1260, it became a hereditary office consolidated by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Al</b> Fadl dynasty, direct descendants of the Tayyid clan of Banu Jarrah. The office remained in the household <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Al</b> Fadl emir, Isa ibn Muhanna, with occasional interruption, well into the early Ottoman era, during which Isa's descendants took over leadership of the Mawali tribe. Under the Ottomans, the role of the amir al-ʿarab appeared centered on providing camels to the state and guarding the Hajj pilgrim caravan in return for annual payments.|$|E

King Hamad enjoys wide executive powers which include appointing the Prime Minister and his ministers, commanding the army, chairing the Higher Judicial Council, appointing the parliament's upper house and dissolving its elected lower house. The head of government is the unelected Prime Minister, Shaikh Khalīfa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the uncle of the current king who has served in this position since 1971, making him the longest serving prime minister in the world.

5|$|Barrow {{managed in}} the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> in 1903, {{finishing}} fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish. With the Tigers, Barrow feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld. Tigers' owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season. Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation. He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League {{for the rest of the}} season. He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906. Disheartened with baseball after finishing in last place, Barrow hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>als</b> {{gene for}} alpha-acetolactate synthase of Lactococcus lactis MG 1363 was cloned on a {{multicopy}} plasmid under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inducible L. lactis lacA promoter. More than a hundredfold overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase was obtained in L. lactis under inducing conditions {{as compared with}} that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host strain, which contained a single chromosomal copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>als</b> gene. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> alpha-acetolactate synthase overproduction on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> end products in various L. lactis strains was studied under different fermentation conditions. Under aerobic conditions and with an initial pH of 6. 0, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>als</b> gene resulted in significant acetoin production that amounted to more than one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyruvate converted. However, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alpha-acetolactate synthase overproduction was even more pronounced in the lactate dehydrogenase-deficient strain L. lactis NZ 2700. Anaerobic cultivation of this strain resulted in a doubling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> butanediol formation <b>of</b> up to 40 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> converted pyruvate. When cultivated aerobically at an initial pH of 6. 8, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>als</b> gene in L. lactis NZ 2700 resulted in <b>the</b> conversion <b>of</b> more than 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyruvate into acetoin, while no butanediol was formed. Moreover, at an initial pH of 6. 0, similar amounts of acetoin were obtained, but in addition approximately 20 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyruvate was converted into butanediol. These metabolic engineering studies indicate that more than 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lactose can be converted via <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overproduced alpha-acetolactate synthase in L. lactis...|$|R

5|$|Following al-Adil's {{death in}} 1218 {{and the death}} of Haditha a few years later, the imarat al-ʿarab was divided by Sultan al-Kamil (r. 1218–1238) between Haditha's sons Mani and Ali, who founded the {{independent}} Al Ali branch of Al Fadl, and their kinsman, Ghannam ibn Abi Tahir <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Al</b> Faraj clan. As Mani's position was bolstered by his cooperation with the Ayyubids in their military campaigns and keeping the Bedouin in check, al-Kamil dismissed Ghannam and Ali, leaving Mani as the sole amir al-ʿarab. When Mani died in 1232/33, he was succeeded by his son Muhanna I after an agreement between the Ayyubid emirs of Homs and Damascus, al-Mujahid Shirkuh II and al-Ashraf Musa, respectively, without input from the sultan of Egypt. From this period until 1260, only scant information is available about the imarat al-ʿarab. However, it is known that in 1240, Muhanna I was replaced by Tahir ibn Ghannam by the Ayyubid regent of Aleppo, Dayfa Khatun, for Tahir's support against her dynastic opponents. Some years later, the title was bestowed on Ali or his son Abu Bakr.|$|E

It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect Bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support the rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Al</b> Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British.|$|E
