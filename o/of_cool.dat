5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In an environment <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E

5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and temperature gradients above the Atlas mountain range were evident on 19September, a result <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> sea air attempting to penetrate inland; {{south of the}} mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure area in a mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> sea air, however, it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core cut-off low, and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E
50|$|He {{began work}} {{into the design}} <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> towers. Previously, designs <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> towers were more-or-less the same as chimneys, in {{octagonal}} planform. On 12 February 1915, the Dutch State Mines decided {{to build a new}} concrete cooling tower. This led to his work producing the hyperboloid design <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> towers at the Staatsmijn Emma in 1918; the towers were demolished on 26 June 1985. This design <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> towers was the world's first, and nearly all cooling towers now follow this hyperboloid design, with concrete structure. On 16 August 1916, he took out the UK patent (108,863) for Improved Construction <b>of</b> <b>Cooling</b> Towers <b>of</b> Reinforced Concrete; the patent was filed on 9 August 1917, and published on 11 April 1918.|$|R

This research is an experimental research using two factor independent variable (feedrate and timing <b>of</b> <b>cooling)</b> and one dependent variable (rate wear of HSS end mill cutter). The results data of this research described using descriptive analytic method. The results of discussion with this method was enhancement of feedrate and timing <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> the rate wear cutter increases. Type of cutter wear that occurs is flank wear and began to grow relatively quickly then followed by a relatively slow growth to a certain cutting. The smallest edge of the cutter rate wear occurs when interaction feedrate 0. 11 mm/rev with a timing <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> 10 minutes value is 562. 57 μm, while the largest edge of the cutter rate wear occurs when interaction feedrate 0. 15 mm/rev with a timing <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> 20 minutes value is 958. 65 μm.

5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E

5|$|After briefly {{moving over}} land, Keith turned north under the {{influence}} of a trailing frontal trough. The storm became disorganized while recurving northeast because of increased vertical wind shear and the presence <b>of</b> <b>cool</b> dry air from its north. On November23, Keith made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, with winds of 65mph (100km/h), while most of its convection was well {{to the north of the}} center. Its landfall was the second latest on record for the Continental United States, only behind a hurricane in the 1925 season. The storm quickly weakened as it crossed Florida, and within hours the winds dropped to 40mph (65km/h). Reaching the Atlantic Ocean eight hours after moving ashore, Keith began to gradually re-intensify, and {{under the influence}} of a very large upper-level low pressure area over Newfoundland, the storm accelerated northeast. On November24, the storm again reached its peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), shortly before becoming an extratropical cyclone near Bermuda. Keith restrengthened and deepened into a powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining hurricane-force winds and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (27.92inHg). The extratropical storm turned westward and was last observed on November26 northeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} intensity, Typhoon Halong had gale-force winds that {{extended}} 415km (260mi) {{northeast of the}} center. It was continuing to the northwest toward Okinawa, and threatened to strike the island at near peak intensity. However, the typhoon began rapidly weakening due to increasing wind shear, and the eye quickly deteriorated. At around 1200UTC on July14, Halong made landfall on Okinawa with 10‑minute winds of 130km/h (80mph). Around that time, the typhoon moved through a weakness in the ridge, turning {{to the north and}} later accelerating to the northeast. The combination <b>of</b> <b>cool,</b> dry air, and the persistent wind shear removed the convection from the center by early on July15, weakening Halong to tropical storm status. Later that day, the JTWC discontinued advisories while the storm was approaching Japan, and the agency classified Halong as extratropical. The JMA continued tracking the storm, and Halong struck both the Izu and Bōsō peninsulas along Honshu. Late on July16, the JMA classified Halong as extratropical, and shortly thereafter the storm dissipated over the Kuril Islands. The extratropical remnants of Halong moved out of the basin late on July 19, just prior dissipating.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{interaction}} with the high terrain of northern Luzon, Bess temporarily weakened to a tropical storm before regaining typhoon strength over the South China Sea during the afternoon of October11. As the storm emerged back over water, satellite images revealed a relatively large system with clouds spanning an area 485km (300mi) in diameter. Upon reintensifying, Bess turned due west {{in response to a}} dominating high-pressure area over Southern China. With a large difference in pressures between the two systems, a strong northeasterly flow developed between them. This resulted in gale-force winds occurring up to 400km (250mi) from Bess's center. During the evening of October12, the combined effects of a winter monsoon and entrainment <b>of</b> <b>cool,</b> dry air from mainland China began to weaken the system. By the following morning, Bess had weakened to tropical storm as it passed 305km (190mi) south of Hong Kong. The system later struck Hainan Island with winds of 85km/h (50mph) before lessening to a tropical depression. The dissipating system emerged over the Gulf of Tonkin on October14 and ultimately dissipated as it began moving ashore in northern Vietnam later that day.|$|E
