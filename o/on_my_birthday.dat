500|$|In February 2012, it was {{speculated that}} Christina Aguilera would appear as the {{featured}} artist on the release after Rihanna posted {{a message on}} Twitter saying, [...] "I need somebody #DIRRRTY [...] <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>Birthday</b> #CAKE ," [...] a supposed reference to Aguilera's 2002 song [...] "Dirrty", which contains lyrical content relating to various sexual activities.

500|$|The Golden Age of Grotesque is {{the final}} studio album to feature {{longtime}} keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit the group over the following years. John 5's relationship with Manson had soured {{over the course of}} the Grotesk Burlesk Tour. According to John, Manson spoke to him only once during the entire tour: [...] "It was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>birthday</b> and he turned to me and said, 'Happy birthday, faggot'—then walked away." [...] Manson also displayed hostility towards the guitarist on stage. During a performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then shoved John, who responded in anger by throwing his guitar to the ground and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Gacy, who was also the band's last remaining original member – excluding Manson – quit shortly before the recording of the band's next studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me (2007). He would later file a $20 million lawsuit against Marilyn Manson for unpaid [...] "partnership proceeds", accusing the vocalist of spending money earned by the band on [...] "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy, including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{coming back}} from the feast at Kubera's palace, Ganapati was riding on his mouse on the way home. It was a full moon that night. As he was riding, his mouse saw a snake and ran behind the bush. Ganapati fell to the ground and his stomach broke open. Ganapati started to put the food back in his stomach. The moon god saw him and started {{laughing}} loudly. Angered by this, Ganapati pronounced a curse on the moon god: [...] "You shall be always black and never be seen by anyone". Frightened by the curse, the moon god started pleading for mercy. Ganapati said [...] "Ok, but you shall be changing from new moon to full moon. Also if anyone sees the moon <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>birthday,</b> he or she shall not attain moksha (liberation)." [...] The moon god kept quiet. After Ganapati had finished putting the food in his stomach, he took the snake and tied it around his belly. Then he continued going back home.|$|E

2500|$|That same month, Ciara {{said that}} there was no release date for the album. She instead said [...] "I think I'm almost done. I think there was a date December 4 that was {{supposedly}} put in the universe, but the date was never ever confirmed, not from my mouth, but they can definitely look out for this album this winter. I'll be telling you soon. Stay tuned. You know what? I'm giving you guys my video [...] <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>birthday,</b> so you never know what could happen around Christmas-time.

On April 15, 2013, Ciara revealed the official tracklist for the album and confirmed that it is now titled Ciara. Additionally, she stated that it would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was then postponed to July 9, 2013. The aforementioned singles were swept aside from the album and subsequently under the title Ciara, the album is now led by the single [...] "Body Party". The album artwork features a mirror-flipped image of Ciara.|$|E

[...] Pat Hanrahan, ex-bare-knuckle-prize fighter and roughhouse-expert, stepped forth. The two men came against each other in grips, and almost before he had exerted himself the Irishman found himself in the merciless vise of a half-Nelson that buried him head and shoulders in the snow.

But one look of welcome can still find me in my solitude--the lovely morning look of nature, as I now see it from the casement of my room. Brighter and brighter shines out the lusty sun from banks of purple, rainy cloud; fishermen are spreading their nets to dry on the lower declivities of the rocks; children are playing round the boats drawn up on the beach; the sea-breeze blows fresh and pure towards the shore----all objects are brilliant to look on, all sounds are pleasant to hear, as my pen traces the first lines which open the story of my life.|$|E
60|$|The Sewing Circle met at Mary Gillespie's <b>on</b> <b>my</b> fortieth <b>birthday.</b> I {{have given}} up talking about <b>my</b> <b>birthdays,</b> {{although}} that little scheme is not much good in Avonlea where everybody knows your age--or if they make a mistake it is never {{on the side of}} youth. But Nancy, who grew accustomed to celebrating <b>my</b> <b>birthdays</b> when I was a little girl, never gets over the habit, and I don't try to cure her, because, after all, it's nice to have some one make a fuss over you. She brought me up my breakfast before I got up out of bed--a concession to my laziness that Nancy would scorn to make on any other day of the year. She had cooked everything I like best, and had decorated the tray with roses from the garden and ferns from the woods behind the house. I enjoyed every bit of that breakfast, and then I got up and dressed, putting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> second best muslin gown. I would have put <b>on</b> <b>my</b> really best if I had not had the fear of Nancy before my eyes; but I knew she would never condone THAT, even on a <b>birthday.</b> I watered <b>my</b> flowers and fed my cats, and then I locked myself up and wrote a poem on June. I had given up writing birthday odes after I was thirty.|$|R
