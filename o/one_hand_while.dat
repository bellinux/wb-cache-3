5|$|The {{developers}} {{tried to}} redefine Lara Croft's actions by questioning {{what they felt}} the character was capable of. While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, Underworld introduced motion capture-based animation to display more fluid, realistic movement and facial expressions. Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actress, and advised the designers on practical movements. Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations. The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement. Actions were overlapped to allow for multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> the other holds an object collected from the environment. Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions identical, although the systems use different techniques to achieve this. In response to Underworlds lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character's appearance to appeal more to female fans.|$|E

25|$|The eagle feather law, which {{governs the}} {{possession}} and religious use of eagle feathers, was written {{with the intention}} to protect then dwindling eagle populations on <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> still protecting traditional Native American spiritual and religious customs, to which the use of eagle feather is central, on the other hand. As a result, the possession of eagle feathers is restricted to ethnic Native Americans, a policy that is seen as controversial for several reasons.|$|E

25|$|The fire {{became so}} intense that Rose was forced to crawl from {{position}} to position in order to treat the wounded, giving words of encouragement and directing the fire of the inexperienced and terrified Vietnamese and Montagnard troops. Over the next few days, the company marched west and deeper into Laos, fending off incessant attacks from elements ranging from squad-sized to company-sized, covered by Air Force gunships. On 12 September, during an assault by a NVA company-sized element, one of the Montagnards was wounded 40 to 50 meters outside the perimeter. Dodging enemy fire, Rose ran and crawled {{his way to the}} wounded man, shielding him with his own body while he treated him. He dragged the Montagnard back to the company with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> firing at the enemy with his gun in his other hand.|$|E
25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|E
500|$|Manual gas {{tungsten}} arc welding {{is a relatively}} difficult welding method, due to the coordination required by the welder. [...] Similar to torch welding, GTAW normally requires two hands, since most applications require that the welder manually feed a filler metal into the weld area with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> manipulating the welding torch in the other. Maintaining a short arc length, while preventing contact between the electrode and the workpiece, is also important.|$|E

500|$|... in {{line with}} {{orthodox}} animal rights theory, animals are owed some utility-trumping rights—a right not to suffer and a right not to be killed; but, {{in line with}} utilitarianism, [...] wants to promote well-being without giving animals a right to liberty {{in the sense of}} outright protection from ownership and use by humans. Cochrane thus successfully ‘decouples’ the rights-utilitarian dichotomy and locates his theory in the middle ground between the two. You might say he gives with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> taking away with the other.|$|E
500|$|American kestrels are bred {{in captivity}} {{for use in}} falconry, and are among the easier falcons to breed. [...] They are also {{sufficiently}} common that [...] "passage" [...] birds {{in their first year}} are relatively easy to trap. [...] Wild caught kestrels [...] "tame down" [...] fairly quickly. [...] They will usually be eating from a falconer's hand the day after capture, be training within a week, and be ready to hunt in three to five weeks. [...] A very tame American kestrel will allow itself to be picked up around the body with <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> accepting tidbits from the other hand. Such tameness is very useful when checking or treating the bird for injury or illness.|$|E
500|$|Moving {{forward with}} his platoon, Derrick {{attacked}} a Japanese post {{that had been}} holding up the advance. He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank. The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts. Clambering up the cliff face under heavy fire, Derrick held on with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other, like [...] "a man... shooting for [...] goal at basketball". Climbing further up the cliff and {{in full view of}} the Japanese, Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire. Within twenty minutes, he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts, while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg.|$|E

500|$|Although less {{dangerous}} than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, {{and would be}} exacerbated by constant exposure {{to high levels of}} mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems.|$|E
500|$|Once in office, Sihanouk {{introduced}} several constitutional changes, including extending suffrage to women, adopting Khmer as {{the sole}} official language {{of the country and}} making Cambodia a constitutional monarchy by vesting policy-making powers in the prime minister rather than the king. He viewed socialism as an ideal concept for establishing social equality and fostering national cohesion within newly independent Cambodia. In March 1956 he embarked on a national programme of [...] "Buddhist socialism", promoting socialist principles on the <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> maintaining the kingdom's Buddhist culture on the other. Between 1955 and 1960, Sihanouk resigned and retook the post of prime minister several times, citing fatigue caused by overwork. The National Assembly nominated experienced politicians such as Sim Var and San Yun to become prime minister whenever Sihanouk took leave, but they similarly relinquished their posts each time, several months into their term, as cabinet ministers repeatedly disagreed over public policy matters.|$|E
500|$|Scenes of Hollywood cityscapes, {{as well as}} {{shots of}} heaven {{at the end of}} the film, were {{achieved}} through the creation of miniature sets that were filmed in long shots to give the appearance that they were large and expansive. A total of 45 sets were built in total, none larger than about two square feet, with the most expensive costing $1.67. It took days to prepare these sets. Florey cut cardboard from laundered shirts and shaped them into squares while Vorkapić painted them impressionistically to resemble buildings. The elevated trains in the cityscape scenes were actually toy trains Florey purchased and mounted on pasteboard runaways. He would pull them along the track on a string with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> he shot the scene with the other. Movement on the miniature sets was simulated by moving lamps and casting shadows. To make the miniature sets look more realistic and to conceal defects, prisms and kaleidoscopes were placed in front of the camera lens and moved during filming, and cylinder lens systems were used and rotated during shooting to magnify the image to the desired diameter. Florey said this was useful in [...] "giving the scenes the rhythms which we thought they required".|$|E

Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top cover hinge pin {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover hinge pin that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> <b>while</b> working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|R
500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E
500|$|Press {{releases}} describe Gwen {{in light}} of contradictions between her heroic and conventionally feminine roles in the series; despite becoming a [...] "tough, ruthless warrior, who loves {{the thrill of the}} fight" [...] Gwen remains a [...] "funny, salty, earthy woman who loves home and family". Children of Earth sees Gwen become pregnant by husband Rhys; a storyline which IGN writer Asham Haque thought provided [...] "one of the few hope-giving threads" [...] in the serial. She gives birth to a baby girl, Anwen, between the third and fourth series. Both Eve Myles and creator Russell T Davies have described this plot development as emblematic of a contradiction at the heart of Gwen's character. Myles, believing that motherhood gives Gwen a greater sense of responsibility, says it makes Gwen [...] "even more human, and yet even more of a wonder woman". Whilst talking about the show's fourth series, Davies suggested that it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to use the image of [...] "Gwen Cooper with baby in one arm and gun in the other" [...] as promotion. The production team have continued to emphasise this contradictory aspect to Gwen's character, which has proved popular with critics and viewers. For example, a promotional clip for Miracle Day features Gwen firing from her gun in <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> protectively holding her baby in the other. Zap2it's Mikey O'Connell praised this as one of the trailer's best aspects, praising Gwen as [...] "the coolest mum ever." [...] Reviewing the opening episodes of Miracle Day Mary McNamara [...] of the Los Angeles Times identified [...] "the dark humor" [...] of the sequence as representative of [...] "the top notes of the British Torchwood". The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Gee praised the dichotomy between the character's two roles, stating that [...] "Eve Myles's homely yet badass agent is incredibly charming".|$|E
