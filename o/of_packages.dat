5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E

5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a number <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates {{that it must be}} solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74TBq (20Curie) of radioactive activity. In a recent example, the ships Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331kg (730lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River, South Carolina.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other {{operating}} systems, OpenBSD provides a package management system for easy installation {{and management of}} programs which {{are not part of}} the base operating system.

25|$|Installing, {{updating}} {{and removing}} software in Linux is typically done {{through the use}} of package managers such as the Synaptic Package Manager, PackageKit, and Yum Extender. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>packages,</b> not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{fourteen}} studies in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine and changing front–line drug treatment, found decision making {{limited by the}} lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the small number of cost-effectiveness analyses, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> of measures and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.|$|E
25|$|The American Messenger Company focused {{primarily}} on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle. In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded {{for the first time}} outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> for UPS operations.|$|E

500|$|The {{large sums}} of money being made and spent caused an upsurge in crime and illicit {{activity}} in towns along the pipeline route. This was exacerbated by the fact that police officers and state troopers resigned in large groups to become pipeline security guards at wages far in excess of those available in public-sector jobs. Fairbanks' Second Avenue became a notorious hangout for prostitutes, and dozens of bars operated throughout town. In 1975, the Fairbanks Police Department estimated between 40 and 175 prostitutes were working in the city of 15,000 people. Prostitutes brought pimps, who then engaged in [...] In 1976, police responded to a shootout between warring pimps who wielded automatic firearms. By and large, however, the biggest police issue was the number of drunken brawls and fighting. On the pipeline itself, thievery was a major problem. Poor accounting and record keeping allowed large numbers of tools and large amounts of equipment to be stolen. The Los Angeles Times reported in 1975 that as many as 200 of Alyeska's 1,200 yellow-painted trucks were missing from Alaska and [...] "scattered from Miami to Mexico City". Alyeska denied the problem and said only 20–30 trucks were missing. The theft problem was typified by pipeliners' practice of mailing empty boxes to pipeline camps. The boxes then would be filled with items and shipped out. After Alyeska ruled that all packages had to be sealed {{in the presence of a}} security guard, the number <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> being sent from camps dropped by 75 percent.|$|E
