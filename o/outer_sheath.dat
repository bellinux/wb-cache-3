5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an <b>outer</b> <b>sheath</b> called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard <b>outer</b> <b>sheath.</b> The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E

40|$|It is {{believed}} that DOPA-negative melanocytes in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> of the human hair follicle are activated, become identifiable by DOPA staining, and migrate into the epidermis during the repigmenting phase of vitiligo. These cells are difficult to identify, however, and otherwise have not been characterized. These cells are readily identified by immunofluorescence, imniunohistochemistry, and immunoelectronmicroscopy using the antibodies NKI/beteb and A 4 F 11, which recognize premelanosome-related antigens. The majority of the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> melanocytes {{were found in the}} mid to the upper portion of the hair follicle.

These cells also did not react with HMB 45 antibody, which recognizes a melanosome-associated cytoplasmic antigen. We believe that the inactive <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> melanocytes contain some of the early structural proteins but not any of the enzymatic proteins necessary for melanogenesis.

We combined Dopa-Toluidine Blue complex stain, hair follicle split-Dopa stain and hair follicle split-scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the changes of melanocytes in 23 normal, 24 vitiliginous and 36 repigmented skin specimens. We found that only active (Dopa-positive) melanocytes existed in the epidermis of normal skin. There were some inactive (Dopa-negative) melanocytes in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheaths</b> of normal hair follicles, which form the melanocyte reservoir in human skin. In the patients with vitiligo the active melanocytes in the epidermis were totally missing, whereas the inactive melanocytes in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheaths</b> of hair follicles were not affected. Treatment stimulated the inactive melanocytes in the middle and/or lower parts of the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheaths</b> of hair follicles to divide, proliferate and migrate upward along the surface of the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> to the nearby epidermis, where the melanocytes continued to migrate radially to form the pigmented island visible clinically in repigmented vitiligo lesions.

40|$|Membrane-membrane {{interactions}} between axons and Schwann cells {{are required for}} initial myelin formation in the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies of double myelination in sympathetic nerve have indicated that myelin sheaths continue to exist after complete loss of axonal contact (Kidd, G. J., and J. W. Heath. 1988. J. Neurocytol. 17 : 245 - 261). This suggests that myelin maintenance may be regulated either by diffusible axonal factors or by nonaxonal mechanisms. To test these hypotheses, axons involved in double myelination in the rat superior cervical ganglion were destroyed by chronic guanethidine treatment. Guanethidine-induced sympathectomy resulted in a Wallerian- like pattern of myelin degeneration within 10 d. In doubly myelinated configurations the axon, inner myelin sheath (which lies {{in contact with the}} axon), and approximately 75 % of <b>outer</b> myelin <b>sheaths</b> broke down by this time. Degenerating <b>outer</b> <b>sheaths</b> were not found at later periods. It is probably that <b>outer</b> <b>sheaths</b> that degenerated were only partially displaced from the axon at the commencement of guanethidine treatment. In contrast, analysis of serial sections showed that completely displaced outer internodes remained ultrastructurally intact. These internodes survived degeneration of the axon and inner sheath, and during the later time points (2 - 6 wk) they enclosed only connective tissue elements and reorganized Schwann cells/processes. Axonal regeneration was not observed within surviving outer internodes. We therefore conclude that myelin maintenance in the superior cervical ganglion is not dependent on direct axonal contact or diffusible axonal factors. In addition, physical association of Schwann cells with the degenerating axon may be an important factor in precipitating myelin breakdown during Wallerian degeneration...|$|R

Aims: To characterize the expression of CD 34 immunoreactivity at different stages of the hair cycle in human terminal hair follicles, and to compare the immunostaining pattern of CD 34 with that of CK 15, used here as a marker of the bulge region. Method. Serial vertical sections of human hair follicles in anagen, catagen and tel-ogen phases were immunostained with anti-CD 34 (QBEnd 10) and anti-CK 15 (LHK 15 and C 8 ⁄ 144 B) antibodies.

The catagen and telogen follicles studied did not show CD 34 immuno-reactivity in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath.</b> The location of CD 34 and CK 15 immunoreactivity in anagen follicles reveals a different staining pattern: CD 34 -positive cells are located in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> below the attachment zone of the arrector pili muscle, whereas CK 15 -positive cells are located in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> above the attachment zone of the arrector pili muscle.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that human hair grows at a normal rate in vitro {{for up to}} 10 d. We have also reported that, on gross observation, epidermal growth factor appears to induce a catagen-like effect on cultured hair follicles, {{but we have not}} characterized the details of this. We now report that when isolated human hair follicles are maintained in the presence of epidermal growth factor, the rate of hair follicle elongation is significantly stimulated but hair fiber production is inhibited. Light microscopy showed that epidermal growth factor stimulated a thickening and vacuolation of the cells of the lower <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> of the hair follicle and that the matrix cells of the hair follicle underwent an upward migration resulting in the formation of a 'club hair'-like structure that remained connected to the dermal papilla by a thin strand of epithelial cells. [Methyl- 3 H] thymidine autoradiography was carried out to investigate the patterns of DNA synthesis and showed that epidermal growth factor inhibited DNA synthesis in the hair follicle matrix cells but dramatically stimulated DNA synthesis in the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath.</b> We conclude from these studies that epidermal growth factor may be inducing an artificial 'catagen-like' effect by stimulating <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> proliferation, which uncouples the normal patterns of proliferation and migration that occur in the anagen hair follicle and that result in an anagen-to-catagen- like transition.

FACS analysis of the <b>outer</b> root <b>sheath</b> cells, used to prepare the epidermal equivalents, disclosed a fraction of small cells with enhanced expression of β 1 -integrin, a potential stem cell marker.

This improvement in the treatment of chronic leg ulcers with cultured autologous keratinocytes probably depends on the large compartment of proliferative cells as well as on a well-developed horny layer which prevents disintegration of the grafts.
