5|$|The {{thought as}} enounced {{in the first}} stanza is the {{supremacy}} of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered... which gives an effect <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> spite of the beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded {{with a high}} incidence of crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E

5|$|Away from Crescent's daily {{affairs and}} former {{political}} and media engagements, Ijaz {{has served on}} the College Foundation Board of Trustees at the University of Virginia, and he serves on the advisory board of the Rebuilding Afghanistan Foundation. RAF raises funds for building education infrastructure and programs in Afghanistan, including the construction of schools such as Mayar Elementary School, which enrolled 400 boys and girls from Maidan Wardak Province upon opening in late 2005. During the mid-1990s, Ijaz supported Developments in Literacy, an initiative to build and operate elementary schools in rural Pakistan as alternatives to the religious schools in which many Pakistani children were being radicalized. The group did not seek to create a secularized school system; its goal was to teach the Qur'an as one of many subjects rather than as the only subject. Ijaz and his wife Valérie also serve as goodwill ambassadors for a British charity, Children of Peace, that works to reconcile differences between Palestinian and Israeli youth. In late 2011, while addressing the World Peace Festival, a peace conference held in Berlin, Ijaz announced an intention to donate 1% of his net worth to create a Humanitarian Relief Fund that would make an effort to alleviate the root causes <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> <b>In</b> noting his belief that governments have often failed to provide assistance to the poor in sufficient ways over the long term, Ijaz sought similar pledges for the proposed fund from other philanthropists.|$|E
5|$|Students were {{enrolled}} {{from throughout the}} city. Often the school was used to reassign students {{who could not be}} enrolled into other high schools. As of the 2006-2007 school year, Arlington enrolled 1,825 students. The plurality were Asian, at 48%, with Black, 35% and Hispanic, 11% being the other major ethnic groups. 5% of students identified as White. The school has the highest rate <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> high schools from the Saint Paul Public School system with 89% of students qualifying for Free and Reduced Price Lunch. Free and Reduced Price Lunch is the measure of poverty for the district. The school has a large percentage of students who have limited English proficiency (58%). 14% of students qualify for special education. The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 83% while roughly three out of five students who initially enroll graduate within 4 years. 35% of students had grade level reading proficiency and 13% of students had proficiency in mathematics. Enrollment dropped considerably in the last years with only 875 students enrolled in 2010 and projections of only 650 for 2011.|$|E

The issue <b>of</b> relative <b>poverty</b> and its measurement are contentious political issues, with many on the left wing of Australian politics arguing that relative poverty {{ought to be the}} appropriate measure. Relative income poverty, for example, looks at the percentage of the population that earns less in comparison to average earnings. Many on the right of Australian politics argue that this relative measure is a mistake because it hides the existence <b>of</b> absolute <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> Australia by looking only at those who, for whatever reason, earn relatively little.|$|R

25|$|The level <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>in</b> Tanzania is very high. Tanzania {{has made}} little {{progress}} towards reducing extreme hunger and malnutrition. The 2010 Global Hunger Index ranks {{the situation as}} “alarming”. Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger, although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight. Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment; limited access to farm inputs, extension services and credit; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources.|$|E

There {{have been two}} major methods to measure poverty in Morocco, which include the 'classic approach' and a second approach that pertains more towards the capabilities approach. The 'classic approach' uses the poverty line to statistically determine the impoverished population.

The second approach focuses on satisfying this lack of basic needs and emphasizes the multidimensional nature of poverty.|$|E
